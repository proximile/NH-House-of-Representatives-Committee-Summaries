00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
morning gentlemen how are you so we're
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
just we're going to start um I don't
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
think there's a ton to go over anyway uh
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
from my perspective but um if any of you
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
gentlemen would like to join us up at
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
the mic and just to discuss uh the issue
 
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
in general and also the amendment that
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
we have before us that would be that' be
 
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
great I don't think this is a
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
controversial bill but seems pretty
 
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.469 align:start position:0%
controversial bill but seems pretty
straightforward

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
um so what we're looking at in front of
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
us is um a a new definition in statute
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
for station Weare uh because we don't
 
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
have that right now
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
correct and um we want to be able to do
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
that so we can differentiate between P
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
between the personal protective wear and
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
the station wear correct correct so that
 
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
we can work towards um firefighters not
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
having to wear past lated stuff until
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
such time that hopefully we get new
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
equipment that isn't ladened with that
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
but also doesn't burn I'm understanding
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
so far yes all right so um the um Fred
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
for your benefit uh the amendment to the
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that I have in front of me or
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
at least a proposal of one I haven't
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
brought it to OS yet um if you look at
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
page two line nine um we've adjusted the
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
safe alternative to current firefighting
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment um if it's
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
designed um from the requirement shall
 
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
be required to should a preference being
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
given to it so if that new equipment
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
comes on the marketplace fire stations
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
aren't required to pick it up but um
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
they are encouraged to pick it up as
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're going through the regular
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
replacement that they would normally do
 
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so uh Gear replacement um
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
by manufacturer date is good for 10
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
years before it needs to be replaced um
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
and what we were trying to avoid was to
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
put municipalities in uh a position
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
where there was some sort of UN funded
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
mandate to say You must purchase
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
whatever gears on the market that meets
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
these requirements um instead we think
 
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
that there's enough uh we're leaning on
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing industry enough from
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
an international perspective to start
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
having these manufacturers develop this
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
gear over time um so as you mentioned is
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
it would just be encouraged um at that
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
point but I do believe nationally at
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
some point there's going to be a drop
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
dead date on when you can have a gear
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
with known pfast manufactured any it so
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get ahead of it yeah and
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
assuming ah Peter how are you now we're
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
official yeah um assuming of course that
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh they are able to develop gear that
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't use pep fast in it correct
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
because it's still the safest thing we
 
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
have on the market correct yeah it's
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
still the safest for for an uh what we
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
call an idlh which is immediate danger
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
to life and health um there is I I don't
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to give you the
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturer name because I don't I
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
don't remember if I'm 100% correct on it
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
um but there is one manufacturer right
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
now who's saying that they'll have this
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
developed soon um I do know that we have
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh one fire department and and it
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
happens to be here in conquer that is
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
looking to U move forward with the
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing of this gear um so it is on I
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say the immediate Horizon but
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's coming close okay um backing up
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
just a sec to line one uh the
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer person selling fire
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
fighting personal protective equipment
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
and the purchaser of purchaser of the
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
equipment shall retain the notice of the
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
procurement files for at least three
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
years from the date of the transaction
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
um first
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
off that's the notification of whether
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
or not there are p fases in the material
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of the three-year
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
Mark so that is what's in current law um
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
so we're not proposing that we would
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
change that
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
um what we're looking to change is Right
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
Now by law if the gear has p in it the
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has to send a letter um and
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
that letter goes in the personnel file
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh indefinitely and then remains in the
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
procurement files for the Department for
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
three years I don't know why they landed
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
on that um that was before my time but
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is because the
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry is uh many of
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
them are saying no our gear does not
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
have p in it we want to change the law
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that notification
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
comes regardless of what the claim is if
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
they say the gear has no p in it we also
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
want that on file y um and then we want
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
a copy of the same to be provided to the
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
employee which is not a current uh uh
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
under current law right now we want the
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
the physical employee to have a copy of
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
that letter yeah so they know what
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
they're wearing y okay and then um oh
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:04.430 align:start position:0%
they're wearing y okay and then um oh
Peter

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
so Brian what kind of push back you get
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
from manufactur I mean I toally I
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
totally get the idea that you want that
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
because they need to put that stuff in
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
there to make the gear
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
work uh I'd say
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
yes then and that the firefighter has to
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
we that
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
get kill
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
fire injur it's a trade
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
off fact has to be clear that he's
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
wearing that it's kind of like you're
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
taking the risk by being a figh lots of
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
R but this is one of them that you
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
should at least have a record of
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I mean it's just not
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
right not to not to have theity if the
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers say it's not in there then
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
that should
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
be it's a cim right yeah um thank you
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative for the question we want
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that manufacturer is
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
on record um stating it does or it does
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
not have it in it I will say um I'm
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
unaware of it happening here in New
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as of yet um but there has
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
been this is a international issue um
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
and there has been a number of lawsuits
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
that are now currently being worked
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
through um with manufacturers saying our
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
gear does not have pasas in it uh and
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
scientists saying that it does in fact
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
have it in there so um the International
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters is fighting
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
against the National Fire Protection
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
Agency as well as uh gear
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and that's when I say that
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh our organization is leaning on these
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to make these changes
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's the intended effect here is just
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
to put uh pressure from a New Hampshire
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
perspective um to say that we're not
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do this
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
anymore we're not going to what we're
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
not going to put our firefighters in a
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
position where they are known to be
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
exposed to past chemicals well if
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's if there's a VI if there's an
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
alternative I remember we we had a
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
build maybe 10 years ago right there was
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
a big issue about firefighting phones
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on and Adam you
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
probably remember uh that um that there
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
was an
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
alternative maybe it was completely
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
harmless but it was a lot better than
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
that bu back right
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
remember yeah so um that's exactly it
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
right now is there is no alternative um
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
and it is has been proven that the gear
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
with P in it it's almost a roll of the
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
dice whether or not you're going to get
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
cancer but certainly if you were to go
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
into an a a fire without this gear on
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
you would not survive so that's the
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
tradeoff um when there becomes an
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
alternative then it becomes harder and
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
harder for either a municipality or a
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to not provide that
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
alternative and that's what we're trying
 
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
alternative and that's what we're trying
to

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish so you're yes
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay with that um I am yeah no that
 
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
sounds good any other Fred anything up
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
point correct they have uh there are
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
certain manufacturers that have um been
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
able to identify uh firefighter turnout
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
gear is comprised of three
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
layers um that's how it's constructed uh
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
some of those layers they've been able
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
to uh identify Alternatives that do not
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
have past in it what they're struggling
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
with is to find a safe alternative um
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
for the uh water and oil repellent and
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what is that's what
 
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:12.519 align:start position:0%
they're using the past for as a durable
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
water and oil repellent so that you
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
don't go into a fire and get your skin
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
wet to the point that you burn kind of
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
from the inside of your gear out um so
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the key word here or
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
the key words is safe alternative um
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
identify um turnout gear that has no P
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
Fass in it but is not going to protect
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
us within a fire either we and that's
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
why we drafted it the way we did was we
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that this
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
alternative is proven to be safe um
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
we're not just going to take any any
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
gear off the street without making sure
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's tested and proven first and and
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
once again it's not required anyway it's
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
just strongly encouraged in the language
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
of of the bill or the new so uh Peter
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
that would be line nine and 10 um the
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that we're talking
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
about right now would strike shall be
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
required and is replaced by should give
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
preference to an alternative as part of
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
the existant existing personal
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
protective equipment yeah on page two on
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
page two two yeah you'll see it it's
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's in lighter on yours but be
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
reking that and changing it to should
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
should yep and and that's for um as
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
Brian was saying maybe just before you
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
came in um not downshifting costum
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities into some smaller fire
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
departments if for example a safeer
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
alternative came out but it was two or
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
three times the expense uh because of
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing type they didn't want
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
to push that onto a smaller fire
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
department they can have that
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
conversation on whether they give their
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
guys cancer in their own town I suppose
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
um or or how often potentially they have
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
to put that stuff on if it's once every
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
you know nine months or I don't know
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
what happens in the volunteer
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
departments it's kind of all over the
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
map yeah okay so so that would be a
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
conversation that could be had any other
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee though up
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
11 were there any issues before I came
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
no I don't think so everything's the
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
major differences between the original
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
um bill and the amendment you were here
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
for so we could talk about the
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but um let's see so uh
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
moving on then uh line 12 uh I only had
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
one question on lines 12- 16 it says
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
until such time that a safe alternative
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
is provided to the employee fire
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
department shall have in place a policy
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
that limits the unnecessary exposure to
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
figh or fighting uh Personnel protective
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
equipment nothing in this subsection
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
shall refute that it Remains the best
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
practice for firefighting personal
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
protective equipment to be warned while
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
operating in an environment that poses
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
an immediate danger to life or health um
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
my only question Mr R on that
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
is obviously this would this would put
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
pressure to give preference to not
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
wearing the equipment as much as humanly
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
possible are you at all concerned that
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
this opens up the risk that a fire chief
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
will go too far and not have his men
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
wear it in a toss-up situation and then
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
somebody ends up getting injured sure um
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question I I don't
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
believe so um in fact we've been working
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
closely with the fire chiefs on this
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
issue to make sure that we get it right
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
because we don't want um it's not our
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
intent to put fire chiefs in a position
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
where they can't lead and do their job
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that came up was
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
for instance training what about putting
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
our firefighters in gear while we're
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
training is that um are we going to get
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
in trouble for that quite frankly a that
 
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
in trouble for that quite frankly a that
happens

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
now with P knowingly in the gear um and
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's not created an issue here in New
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um secondly
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
the we we chose our words carefully um
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
in using unnecessary exposure um if a
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
fire chief determines that exposure
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
quote unquote to be necessary that gets
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
them off the hook for for any wrongdoing
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
so the the point here is uh each
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
individual fire chief with had the
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
autonomy to look at their policies from
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
within many policies are just created by
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs many um have a Labor
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
Management component where they work
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
together to develop policies um but
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
essentially they would develop a policy
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
put it in place that says um you know
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
for instance where I work in Portsmouth
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you will wear you will wear your gear
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
in an idlh environment as we spoke of
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
earlier um or for any vehicle
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
extrication or uh relevant training or
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature um all this
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
would do would force departments to
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
create their
 
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
create their
policies

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
that determine what is necessary and
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
not and what oh go ahead no go
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
ahead uh immediately dangerous to uh
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
life and
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
health so what are the ramifications if
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
um these policies are put in place and
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
then somebody questions and and wins
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
that the fact that it wasn't necessary
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and they required them to wear it or
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
vice versa um an injury or um disease
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
occurs arguably for that reason sure
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
like can they sue can they like what's
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
the um we have not put anything in place
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
that would determine that but what I can
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
say is determining whether the wearing
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
of turnout gear is necessary or
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um to my knowledge across
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
the board is subjective in nature um
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
because for instance we met may tell
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
someone they have to wear their
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
firefighting turnout gear to do vehicle
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
extrication but another department may
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
have specialized gear that they wear to
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
do vehicle extrication um so really it's
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
going to be it would be extremely
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to identify whether or not you
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
put someone in gear and they said that
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary exposure well take
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
training for instance a fire chief might
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
determine that we need to crawl around
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and do search and rescue training we
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
need to do that with our gear on um so
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
he's determined that or she has
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
determined that to be necessary
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
necessary potential exposure um and if
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary for instance um what
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is trying to curtail is those
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters going out um and doing uh
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
veeh or um excuse me traffic details or
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
standing by at a a power line down and
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're wearing their turnout coat um
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
this is what that's trying to to C tail
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but there are no civil or
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
criminal there's we have not put
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
anything in place for that I I
 
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.830 align:start position:0%
anything in place for that I I
unfortunately

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
I um I'm more comfortable if it's not
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
there I'm just yeah yeah yeah not having
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
spoken with with you know any civil
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys on this I don't know if
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
there's exposure there
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't look like there is any in
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
statute unless it was somewhere um
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
around I can go back and look at 5 154
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
A8 in that section and just see if
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's any but it's certainly not in
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
the amendment or the original bill as
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
proposed so and and I could um also
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
speak to the policy that we're trying to
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
make sure is in there um to some degree
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
that already exists under the
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
presumptive cancer law as well um in
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
order for firefighters to get the um the
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
presumptive among other things their
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
department needs to have a policy in
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
place that follows best practices as
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's defined by um the New Hampshire
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
fire academy so that something very
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
similar to that already exists we're
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
just trying to build upon that okay any
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments you're G
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
check yeah I'll check on I'll check on
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
that yep and make sure that I get it I
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
mean certainly have a
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
situation like
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
foot say okay we're going to do a run in
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
ordinary clothing right but you realize
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
in a game when you got when you got a
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
equip on you can't do that put I mean
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
the helmet protects you but it also
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
restricts your
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
visibility you protect your
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
ball head all the way around and you
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
can't do that with helmet sure and
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's why so having a written stated
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
policy I yeah you want to have that in
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
place otherwise then it
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
becomes and again the policy is going to
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
Define what is necessary and what is not
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's the key here is the you said if
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're standing around waiting for
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
something and you're wearing that gear
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
right that does any
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
reason R any thoughts you good okay um
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
so moving on then uh this is where the
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
major differentiation between the
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
original Bill and this comes in line 17
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
through line 22 uh beginning Jan uary
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 fire departments shall not
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
provide as an option the purchasing of
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
firefighting firefighting station wear
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
that contains intentionally added pasas
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
before it was just that you couldn't
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
wear them period um with the fire
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
resistive uh chemicals which contain
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
Florine chlorine bromine lead or animon
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and beginning July 1st
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
2025 uh so pushing it out 6 months uh
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
fire department shall not provide as an
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
option the wearing of the same
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of firefighting station
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
where shall provide fire departments
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
with safer Alternatives should they
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
exist um I'm assuming that the reason
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
for pushing out the wearing is it would
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
give one purchasing cycle for people to
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
make the transition is is that the idea
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
behind that correct yeah this came up um
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
when the during the public hearing and I
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative leakas who
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
brought up his concerns um while he
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated we were trying to avoid uh
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
any unfunded mandate he saw the
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
potential here with the prohibition uh
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
of purchasing and the prohibition of
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
wearing occurring on the very same day
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so the the idea here was um if this
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
gets signed into law um it would be
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
signed in by July 1 of this year which
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
would get one full year um for an
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
employee to stop wearing that that
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
station wear um and the employer
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
provides new uniforms for them to wear
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
or uniform allowance so that they can
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.510 align:start position:0%
or uniform allowance so that they can
purchase

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
onp uh station Weare and and when does
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
that usually come out January 1st uh
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
when does the the allowance forch it
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
varies um I wouldn't say it's a it's a
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
hard and fast rule that it's January 1
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
in fact um ours I think uh begins on
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
July 1 um and it goes with the fiscal
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
year um but in I don't want to say all
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
cases because I don't know that for sure
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
but I would say I believe that in all
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
cases there's uniform allowance that
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
occurs annually or purchasing of
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
uniforms that occurs annually so there
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
should be no reason why this can't um
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
this this can't be taken care of then
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I do want to point out that um it's
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
simply stating that the employer cannot
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
provide as an option the wearing of that
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
so essentially that shifts the burden to
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
the employee to say because most
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
departments have uniform options that
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
they can wear it just removes that as an
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
option um so in the example that you
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
just gave though of uh July 1st because
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
we would be coming up on that within the
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
next few months um being when somebody
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
gets their um
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
allowance if this wasn't clearly
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
communicated before that time for some
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
reason and they went out and bought all
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
their station where they arguably
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting a new allowance
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
until July 1st of the following year
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
which is your deadline for no longer
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
being able to wear that equipment
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
correct correct so that would put them
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
in a situation of at least knowing a
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
year ahead of time but maybe not quite
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
having enough time to pick up the
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
equipment would that be accurate what I
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
can tell you is if you were to and this
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
is just strictly for uniform shirts and
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
pants if I were to order uh a pair of
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
uniform pants or a uniform shirt i' get
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
it in a week it's not is not it's not
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to to find there are um uni
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
form apparel companies all around us
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
that um it's readily available so and
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
and not only that but it's not like fir
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
fighter turnout gear where it cost
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to outfit someone you're talking
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
about a pair of pants for 40 or 50 bucks
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
and a shirt for 20 so um if the dates
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
are off by a week or two one way or the
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
other I don't think it's going to create
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of anxiety
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
okay um any comments answer questions
 
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.470 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
committee um okay um anything else that
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else wanted to state I'm
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
assuming everybody else is in support of
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
changes you guys usually chat about that
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah okay yeah we've we've worked
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
together on this to make sure that we
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
get it right because again um we have uh
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know when we talk about the
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
relationship between labor and
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
management sometimes uh we're we're
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
heading towards the same goal but we
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
just get there differently so we wanted
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for some of these
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
changes or proposed changes to the
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
language is to make sure that uh we get
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
it right to satisfy uh all the groups
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
involved okay perfect um for the
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh anybody philosophically
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to anything that we've heard in
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
the all right um so here's my proposal
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
then um I will look
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
into civil and Criminal stuff just to
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm I highly doubt anything's
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
in there I just want to double check and
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
make sure before we go running this
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
through um and you're going to check
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
that one place we talked about yep
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
double check yeah I'll double check that
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there's no
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
conflict otherwise philosophically it
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're all probably on the
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
same page this seems very reasonable um
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
I will uh get the amendment printed into
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
an official form and then the next time
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
we meet as a subcommittee to look at
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
some of our other ones will just vote on
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
this one and send it to the full
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
committee who's missing Jason missing
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
Jason and Steve Boyd we haven't had
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
Steve here
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
yet yeah so does that sound reasonable
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
or any
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerns all right so uh yeah so barring
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
that guys I think this will
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
probably sail I think I don't think
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see any I don't think any major
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
resistance to yeah I I I feel like it
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
was pretty widely reported early on it
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
was just that date change that needed to
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
be modified so yep all right well thank
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
you having said that I'll close the uh
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
the work session uh for the subcommittee
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
on 1352 and uh we'll pick it back up the
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 01:02:18.109 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everybody uh I
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
want to thank the committee for lasting
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
through a major load of bills today is
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
our last hearing on our original bills
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
we we should be getting many of these
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
out of the way we have next week off
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
unless your subcommittee decides to meet
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
but that's between you and your and the
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
rest of you um and if we get any second
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
committee bills I plan to hear them on
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 6th with an exec session
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
on any bills that have come come out of
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee afterward so uh Reserve
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
that day other than
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
that um March is entire and the 13th is
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
the plan date for all the rest of our
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
bills and beyond that the subcommittees
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
will be working all through March
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
right chair yes so seventh we don't have
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
session then yes scheduling the exact
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
session I don't
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
know I have heard rumors both that we
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
will and that we won't I think it
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
depends on how many bills the other
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
committees get out this week uh at least
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
one committee is meeting today to exact
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
and education had a whole slew of them
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday so they're probably going
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to get away
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
with from all those 10 10 votes
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.390 align:start position:0%

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
all right so we're opening the public
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1328 and
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt is here to
 
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.950 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt is here to
introduce

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
itk you madam chair uh happy to
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
introduce representative PRS Bill House
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 1328 relative Public Safety
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
providers defined as essential
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
Services um and it's a very brief bill
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
as you can all see uh just one line
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
basically First Responders are essential
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
Services providers so uh I I won't take
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
any questions but that speaks for itself
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
Schmidt all right is there anyone else
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
1328 seeing none I'll close the public
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
hearing and go into EX session represent
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
gr you had a motion I do um Madam chair
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
I move a to pass on House Bill
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
1328 okay Al Pat do you wish to speak to
 
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
1328 okay Al Pat do you wish to speak to
your

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you I think by defining
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
um emergency First Responders to this
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
gives them the same um status that other
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
First Responders have and I think it's
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
rather self-evident but if it's
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
something something that people want to
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
put in the statute I'll support that
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
gold oh additional comments I I think
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative grotus said it all all
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
leus just like
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh I mean not having heard anything
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
about this what what are the
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
consequences or the effects of naming
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
them as uh essential service providers
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
what do they get something
 
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
other uh I believe it's something in the
 
01:06:28.279 --> 01:06:34.269 align:start position:0%
other uh I believe it's something in the
Emergency

01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
Management well it gives them the same
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
Authority in law if they're considered
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
essential workers just like uh Public
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
Service fire departments law enforcement
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
and this can give them for example the
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
if an emergency situation should it come
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
up then they are considered part of the
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
team and also I believe that I do we do
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
have other things in statutes that these
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
emergency that this um this type of
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
management Emergency Management has in
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
um access to uh counseling if they need
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
it you know that type of thing Ah that's
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
very true I was just wondering yeah if
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
anybody else has any more information
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
not opposed to this I'm just wondering
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm voting on he just puts them in
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
a category that they have the same job
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
related um pressures and status that the
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
other people who are involved with
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
emergency response have okay thank you I
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
think that's probably the the Genesis is
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
because representative PR is involved in
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that uh counseling uh Team
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
chair also not opposed to this on
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
principle at all I mean it seems
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable um just looked up the um
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
statute that's referenced and um
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
literally are just putting First
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
Responders are essential service
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
providers at the end of it our first our
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
essential service providers
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.870 align:start position:0%
essential service providers
typically

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
um is that typically in statute that we
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
put that I mean it is okay I just don't
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes represent maner py and then
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you um Madam chair just a
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
quick question uh F responders include
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
police fire and are the Emergency Room
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians if it's in a disaster would
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
that become a First
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
Responders that's a First Responders are
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
already defined in statute as you can
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
see in the bill it's
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
emergency emergency Public Safety fire
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%

01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
considered any anyone else Brown yes
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Sor thank you madam chair so
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
looking back at the the the governor's e
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
the order one of them it it does say
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
that industry sectors that provide
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
essential Services etc etc those deemed
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
essential will continue to have the
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
ability to cross state borders for work
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
travel um and transporting products Etc
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
and I know that from my history uh uh
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this the
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
town if you can identify essential
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
workers then you know the people that
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
you can tell to stay home in an
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
emergency that you don't need to have
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
come in and unnecessarily traveling and
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
there's also certainly FEMA has also has
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
a whole list of uh they don't call it
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
essential workers and I wish I could
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
remember what the but they have a c 12
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
categories that Define in an emergency
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
who should be working and who should be
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
staying home ah okay I'm not surprised
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
that FID divides them into 12 categories
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather than two or three but that's the
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
federal government for you or anyone
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
else yeah I'd like to say I'm not sure
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is entirely necessary but it
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
innocuous okay anyone else all right the
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
clerk can call the role oh excuse me
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative Simon you you just just
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
queuing up I don't know I I was going to
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
queuing up I don't know I I was going to
say

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
um if if there is such a thing as an
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
essential service provider whether it's
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
innocuous or not it just seems to me
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
like that these people would fit into
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
that category if such a thing is a thing
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
thing then I don't know who else would
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
fit into it if not these people
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
exactly yes represent chair it might
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
also have something to do with FEMA
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursements or of those things of
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
too yes we don't know enough about FEMA
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
it you are so correct representative
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%

bill uh thank you Mr chair and members
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee House Bill
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
1622 is dare I say it a housekeeping
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
Bill to clean up some of the issues in
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
the administrating rulle making
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
process and it is a request of the
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
office they will be able to explain most
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
of the details I will point out the last
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
two sections number seven and eight
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
of section seven
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
says that if
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
a if an agency levies findes after a
 
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
a if an agency levies findes after a
rule

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
expires or assessed
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
fees from an expired rules that then the
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
agency shall refund all fines and
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
fees that is uh bet that has been the
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
rule in oplc for the most part other
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
agencies have insisted they didn't
 
01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.669 align:start position:0%
agencies have insisted they didn't
collect

01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
any but since a an expired rule is not
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
valid then they can't collect fees and
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
fines that are only in the rule so this
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
will say give it
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
back uh section8 says says that if an if
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
a rule is
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
expired when they're uh proposing
 
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
read-option then they have to provide a
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
written report on what happened while
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
the rule was expired um if we've had one
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
this year where it was expired for a
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
week and a half and they basically said
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
we just didn't do anything on that for
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
the week and a half another one had been
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
expired for 12 years years and it took a
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
little more effort for them to explain
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
what they' done but this way they each
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
agency that de has an expired rule has
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
to think about it and report it prior to
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Jael car meeting so I think those
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
are important and the rest of it is as I
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
said minor cleanup I also am presenting
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
a Germaine Amendment 0306 H which I've
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
distributed this is an addition also at
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
the request of the Jael car staff mostly
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
on timing so uh if you want to talk
 
01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
about the details the jail car staff is
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
here ready to answer your
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
questions if you want to talk principles
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
rules good morning I'm Michael moral I'm
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
the director of the administrative rules
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
unit within the office of legislative
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
Services um I can answer questions or I
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
can briefly go through the bill uh
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee would
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
like uh yes representative leas it would
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
be helpful to just briefly go through
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
the changes in the bill and the
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
amendment as well I agree
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind thank you um the
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
first two sections of the original Bill
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh deal with changes regarding the
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
office of professional Li Insurance
 
01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
office of professional Li Insurance
certification

01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.030 align:start position:0%
certification
oplc

01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
um one it talks about uh records of the
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
boards uh right now it appears that the
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh recordkeeping requirements varies
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
significantly between the uh between the
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
bo boards uh some I think do not even uh
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
mention it um so this would simply
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
require the boards to specifically
 
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
within their rules um specify a date for
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
perhap perhaps three years for record
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
retention it could be whatever they
 
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.950 align:start position:0%
retention it could be whatever they
wanted

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
um the second
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
portion um right now it says
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
licenses shall be valid for 2 years uh
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
we thought this should also include U
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
initial licenses registrations
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
certifications and renewals uh just to
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
those um section three of the
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill it's about certification and
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
Publishing of administrative rules when
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
an agency goes through the rul making
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
process and adopts a rule they then file
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
it with us and it becomes effective um
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
however that's not the end of the
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
process there's a back and forth with
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
the agencies uh regarding small edits
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
typos Etc uh my office also puts in
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
Source notes just like you have at the
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
end of rsas so you can backtrack and see
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
what changes there have been the same
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
thing is done for the rules and our
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
office does that and it applies to every
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
single section
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
um this would
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh require this would uh help the
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
process right now it can be six months
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
maybe even more uh before a rule finally
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
gets certified at which time we publish
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
it on our website um part of that is due
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
to uh backlog for us part of it is due
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the agencies just sitting on the rule
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
and not doing the certification I
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
understand that's a lower priority for
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
agencies but it needs to be done so this
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
would put into effect uh some Provisions
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we think would speed up the process
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
one big thing it would do is as soon as
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
or shortly after receiving an effective
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
rule an adopted rule from the agency we
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
would publish that online right now it's
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
not published until after it's certified
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
so it could be 6 months or more before
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
the public via our website actually see
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
a new rule and it's become problematic
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh both with the public and with the
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
agencies we get calls saying I thought
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
there was a new a new statute that uh
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
and new rules and yes indeed there are
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
they just not are they are just not
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
published so we hope that will uh Help
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
process second ction for the bill deals
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
with interim rules those are rules that
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
are effective for 180 days and there are
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
specific reasons that agencies can use
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
this abbreviated
 
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
this abbreviated
process

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
um right now there is no indication in
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
the statute that a agency can do a
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
conditional approval regarding a um
 
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
interim Rule and so that makes this
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
clearer that they can do
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
clearer that they can do
that

01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
um simply strikes um a
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
measure section
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
six deals with declaratory uh judgments
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
uh if an um if an individual from the
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
public wants to uh challenge a rule they
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
can go to March Superior Court um this
 
01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
can go to March Superior Court um this
would

01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
um If U if there was a challenge uh it
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
also allows them U the individuals to
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
challenge that the agency has been
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
enforcing an expired rule by Statute
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
they cannot do that um therefore they
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
can challenge if an individual perhaps
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
has been fined but the agency did have a
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
fine rule that was still in effect then
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
that could be challenged and the court
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
would also have the authority to impose
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh Financial penalty on the agency
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
including payment of plaintiff's
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
um and representative Maguire has
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
already addressed section 7 and
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
78 um
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment to the
 
01:41:53.679 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment to the
bill

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
um currently the process if an agency
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
files a rule within three weeks of an a
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
Jael car meeting which is the third or
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
fourth Friday of every month um then the
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
agency's rule will be taken up at that
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
meeting uh right now we find that
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
agencies are fing close to the deadline
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have to rule uh review all the
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
final proposals uh then agencies can do
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals and we've been
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
finding that by the time everything is
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
finished it's very close to the jail car
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
meeting and the committee members are
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
not having an uh adequate time to review
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules and comments so we
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
are requesting to change the uh deadline
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
to um allow for 30 days instead of 21
 
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.550 align:start position:0%
to um allow for 30 days instead of 21
days

01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
to have a final proposal on the agenda
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
for a specific
 
01:42:56.199 --> 01:42:57.709 align:start position:0%
for a specific
meeting

01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
um we are also CH uh requesting a change
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
for conditional approval requests uh if
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
you don't know conditional approval is
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
occurs when an agency has submitted the
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
final proposal we've made comments on it
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
and then the agency agrees that yes we
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
should address these comments um so they
 
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
ask for a conditional approval from Jael
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
car to make these extra changes um right
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
now there's a 7-Day deadline for filing
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request uh we
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
are asking that it be U placed 10 days
 
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
ahead of time um there are also amended
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals um there would be
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
a deadline of five days for those that's
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
that occurs when uh we review a
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
request we have further comments agency
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
says yes we want to address them and
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
right now is happening up to a day or
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%

01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%

12
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh there is an expedited process for
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
revising forms um because agency forms
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
are rules uh in the past it has not been
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
clear that they can do a conditional
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
approval on that the statute would the
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment would specifi that that was U
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
possible other than that I would answer
 
01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:52.990 align:start position:0%
possible other than that I would answer
any

01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
questions great representative
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
gr um Mr moral you had mentioned that
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
the um the uh Bill addresses the record
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
retention of the boards which I
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate very much did it does it also
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
address and I didn't read it I could it
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
could be in here where the records are
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
kept usually it's within their offices
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
but since all the boards are attacked to
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
oplc um I would guess that it's being
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
done going to be done centrally uh with
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
oplc but Douglas osterhout The General
 
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
Counsel for oplc is here to testify and
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps he could better address that
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you because that concerns me where
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
the records are thank you uh there was
 
01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:43.639 align:start position:0%
one other point I wanted to make uh the
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
title of the ACT is relative to
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking and license
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
renewals by the office of professional
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
license Insurance
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
certification those are two separate
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
things but I could see that where
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
somebody would read this and think that
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
it covers um that it's all by the oplc
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking and license
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
renewals uh that may be why there are
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
not other agencies in attendance here we
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
have oplc and doj but and no other
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
agencies such as HHS or safety or dees
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
bit hello yes thank you so are you
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
saying that they may not be aware of
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
these changes it's possible yes okay
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank unless they went
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
into the bills and did a search for 541a
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
Manti um will all the records be
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
electronic or will it be both electronic
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
and physical that way the storage is in
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
one place um I don't have the answer for
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
both

01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay yep yep follow up after that so
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the other that I'm trying to understand
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the gray area or the transitional
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
period 180 days they could use the old
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
rules while they implementing the new
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
rules the agencies can transition that
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
way is that my understanding is correct
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
or no uh that's not correct uh when the
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
agency adopts a role whether it's by the
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner or by a board and they file
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
it with us it becomes effective at 12:01
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
a.m. the next day unless they specify a
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
later date for effectiveness
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh once they once the effective date is
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
hit then it's the new rule that applies
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's been
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
published online by
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
US Representative
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
Schmid let's see thank you Mr
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um good morning Mike uh so uh
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is uh this bill and the amendment
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
are entirely the work product of your
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
offices as I have understood uh in
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
coordination or conjunction with oplc as
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
well so this is part of the process of
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning the Jael car process and to
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
some degree the oplc process as we go
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
along and discover that certain things
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't work quite as well as they they
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
might or that they should be codified if
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
they are working well is that
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
correct the bill is primarily our
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
requests um 541a is a fairly fluid
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
statute uh we always look for processes
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
that'll make things easier uh
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
particularly for the agencies um
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we put burdens on them uh the
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process used to be much
 
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
simpler but it had no leeway at all for
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
any changes if an agency had a small
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
error they wanted to fix the only way
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
they could get it was preliminary
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
objection now there are options for
 
01:49:19.639 --> 01:49:20.669 align:start position:0%
objection now there are options for
agencies

01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
so it makes it a little more complicated
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it does require not yearly
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
UT after your long break welcome
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
UT after your long break welcome
back

01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
the S office of professional Li
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
Insurance certification forgot for a
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
second what it stood for look at me go
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
um where to start let's start at section
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
one the office isn't taking a position
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I do think there's some
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
confusion around our record retention
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
policies and I remember this argument
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
sort of coming up argument might be a
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
strong word but I remember this issue
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
sort of coming up when we were adopting
 
01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
the PLC 100s I remember PLC 10
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
205 um and it's around record retention
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
and under our statutory Authority
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
31041 it says that the office will I
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
mean we can read it right here the
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
official record of the office of the
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
boards in accordance with the retention
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
policy established by the office uh I
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
heard the director testify that there
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
are multiple policies in place 57 boards
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
57 rules which is actually what we've
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
been trying to get away from over the
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
the last few years and I think we've
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
actually done that successfully so we uh
 
01:50:56.119 --> 01:50:57.390 align:start position:0%
actually done that successfully so we uh
drafted

01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
up a policy and we worked with doj on
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
this and we sent that to archives and
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
that policy was approved this predates
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
me but it's my understanding it took
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
about two years to get that policy
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
approved so currently from our
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
perspective all of the boards are under
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
the same retention And archiving policy
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the current current Ru making
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are actually under the
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state right now in RSA 5
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
29331 uh that's five colon
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
29 30 and 31 um so so I
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure we really need this
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
section because I think from the
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
office's perspective we have a unified
 
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
record retention policy that we've
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
worked on with doj we've worked we've
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
got approved by archives secretary of
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
state has the rulemaking authority from
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
our perspective it's a uniform process
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a policy that we have in place
 
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
um I think if we do proceed with giving
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
the office administrative rule I think
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be careful
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
about sort of again roles and
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so to answer some of
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
the questions um around oh and there's
 
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's another piece I want to bring up
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
before I move on I think might be some
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
conflicting language in rule but part of
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
our big push over the summer is um
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
having that contractor come in that
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
third party helping us revise the rules
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
for all of the boards and if there's
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
conflicting language there that's a
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
place we can clean it up I'm not sure we
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily need the ru making Authority
 
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:47.250 align:start position:0%
for for for that instance um and
 
01:52:47.250 --> 01:52:48.589 align:start position:0%
for for for that instance um and
[Music]

01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
then where are the records kept
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
currently we keep some of the records in
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
the office um but we do box records up
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
we send them over to archives so they
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
are stored through the Secretary of
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
State in the archival process uh we are
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the process of are they paper or
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
electronic the answer is both we are
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
also we have a vendor um through the
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
state that is taking our paper copies
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
and also scanning them to make
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
electronic copies just for better record
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
retention so but the answer is still
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
both and we also even at the office now
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the majority of Licensing
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
applications are going to be paper
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
applications we're trying to go as
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
paperless as possible but for
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who may not have a computer
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's still paper options so I would
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
say it's leaning towards more electronic
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.510 align:start position:0%
 
both

01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
um the second piece section two not with
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
extending any other state law to the
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
contrary I kind of like this language I
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
think in the cleanup it's it's helpful
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
for us um I do want I
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
um doj raised the issue and I I think
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
they even think this might be too broad
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
an interpretation but we might want to
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
tighten that language up a little and
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
say something along the lines of
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other state law to
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
the contrary pertaining to licensing
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
terms I think the concern is when it
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
says not withstanding any other state
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary somewhere someone
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
along the lines is going to say well
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
that means discipline that means
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
revocation that means all of the things
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very broad reading but
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get out in front of that
 
01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get out in front of that
um

01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh the initial licenses
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
registration certifications and renewals
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think I have an issue with I do
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
worry if it's going to
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
be too limiting we are adopting so in
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 518 which passed out of this
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee we adopted well we put right
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
in that language in RSA 310 that we are
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
using the definition of license under
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
541a which is essentially license
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
registration certification anything that
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
would require State permission so I I
 
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think this language is
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
harmless I'm also not sure if we're
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to need it once licens once it's
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
very clear in RSA 310 that license means
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
all of those things in accordance with
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
541a so that that was in House Bill 518
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
which I we worked on in the fall I think
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
it was a retain Bill and an amendment to
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
on on sections 102 which pertain uh
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly to
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
oplc and then my only other concern and
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
this is a weird position for me to be in
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
because I'm not really speaking on
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of oplc at this time I'm speaking
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
on behalf of somebody who's worked for
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
three separate state agencies and I do
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
have some concerns
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
about the the fee piece and the court
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
having authority to level Financial
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
penalties but I will use I'm going to
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
say a few things one I think oplc is
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
trending in the right direction I think
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
this committee gave the office fee
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
setting Authority which we didn't want
 
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
that 2s it gave us licensed processing
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
Authority which it did in the 300s all
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
of those are effective it says in
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
statute that you can't practice without
 
01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:28.669 align:start position:0%
statute that you can't practice without
a

01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
license I think in the future opl is in
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
a oplc is in a good
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
position regardless of the language in
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
this bill but I do have concerns that
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use oplc for an example if
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're in a position where we had
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
collected a fee
 
01:56:46.639 --> 01:56:48.470 align:start position:0%
collected a fee
$155

01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
$155
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
fee we are now in a position where we
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
could be fined by the court paying
 
01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and have to re reimburse
 
01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.709 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and have to re reimburse
that

01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
$155 fee when the individual let's say
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's a licensing application fee then
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
receive their license so the
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
person received the benefit of paying
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
the fee and I don't want to be the
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
person up here saying oh the rules don't
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
matter they 100% do and we've pushed
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
really hard to make sure they do but I
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
think I have this weird perspective
 
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
because the oplc has been because of
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
these roles and responsibilities reliant
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
on other agencies for our Authority so
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
if the board fails to promulgate rules
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
it would be the oplc staff that suffer
 
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
the consequences for that and so I do I
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
am concerned that just Statewide we need
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
to take a good hard look at at how we
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to implement something like this um
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
again that's kind of speaking not as an
 
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
oplc attorney but as as somebody who's
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
worked for three separate agencies and
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
then the the other issue is I understand
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
that disciplinary action is often laid
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
out in statute but it's not always the
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
case and it's not always statute that
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
agencies rely on and we did a push again
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
in HB 518 where we created sort of a
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
list of uh disciplinary actions that
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
could apply to all boards and there
 
01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
there were a number of reasons for that
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
we made the arguments there um but my
 
01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:23.709 align:start position:0%
we made the arguments there um but my
concern

01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
is the wrong people suffer in this case
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
an administrative agency fails to take
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
action and they allow their discipline
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
their disciplinary rules to lapse I
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
think the harm falls on the public in
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
that instance because now the agency is
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
put in a situation where the choice is
 
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
to enforce a
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
rule and fear the retribution of the
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
court I that might be such a strong
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
verbage but you know what I'm trying to
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
say or allow the bad actor to go
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
unpunished and there there's a lot of
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
cases where I'm not sure I'm I'm
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
thinking back because I used to
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
prosecute prosecute uh APS rules and I
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
had an apsa case where an individual was
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
accused of sexually harassing an
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
individual with a developmental
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
disability in their care I worked with
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
police on that they said there's not
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
enough there to press criminal charges
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a case we can prove Beyond a
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt they did not proceed
 
01:59:32.069 --> 01:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
forward um but the standard at the
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
administrative level was lower and I won
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
that case and we were able to put that
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
individual on the registry and I fear
 
01:59:41.709 --> 01:59:41.719 align:start position:0%
what had happened in that case if APS
 
01:59:45.069 --> 01:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
had allowed their discipline to lapse
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
that bad actor would essentially be out
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
there still doing whatever bad actions
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
they did and I mean I I might be
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
thinking in two
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
two two extreme cases but these are the
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
kind of things from my experience uh
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
I've been with the state about six years
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
now I guess eight years uh three
 
02:00:04.719 --> 02:00:05.750 align:start position:0%
now I guess eight years uh three
different

02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
agencies and so these are just the kind
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
of things that jump out at me when I
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
read the language I I'm
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
not rules are important we need them we
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
need them for due process we need them
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
for fairness people need understand
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on but I think we just need
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
to be very careful about what we do to
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
make sure rules are in place um and I
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
also the director testified to this and
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
and we had had a conversation before
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
this hearing I also would
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
like other agencies to weigh on us a b a
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
bit more because like I said I think
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
From opl's perspective given 518 given
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
655 last year uh given the 300s the 200s
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
the plc 10002s that that we are we're in
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
a pretty good place for this language
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
but I I think it needs more discussion
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh I've been up here for quite a while
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
talking uh but I'm happy to answer any
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent and then like us
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I think those
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
of us who have uh some experience in
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
this situation uh recognize that uh that
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a a tiger we've gotten
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
on board uh and uh that we're kind of
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
legislating on the Fly here so number
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
one is this is going to go to a
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we're going to have to work
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
this out I'll have to check with the
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
chair on there yeah right right so I I
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend that because
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
some of these aspects simply have to be
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
worked out and we we can't decide this
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
on the Fly some of it needs to be
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
investigated and thought about in a way
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we can do in this process so um
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's the first question uh and uh um
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
so have you already my question to you
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh attorney o is um have you been
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
working with with administrative rules
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
unit on some of this because it sounds
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
haven't yeah yeah there we go Nike is
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
kind of funky okay it just took a second
 
02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
to warm up right it's tired of me too
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
um we spoke this morning uh I saw this
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't really had a lot of
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
discussions about it I would
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
say I know where a lot of these things
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
are stemming from so we've probably had
 
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
discussions around some of this stuff in
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
the past but as to this particular Bill
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
not until this morning and I went over
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I just kind of told them what I'd be
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
testifying to so they weren't surprised
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
when I came up here
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah some of this stuff we can
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
clearly approve right off the bat some
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
of it we I think we need to have
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
something like a study committee to go
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
forward to to deal with this um but um
 
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
some of it needs to be and can be
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
immediately enacted but some of it can't
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
in my opinion so we have to work on
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
leus this question just on narrow Point
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so an earlier speaker said or at
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
least I took to imply that uh the
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
individual boards had rule making
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
Authority on records retention but from
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
case uh there we go all right I think
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
that may have been the case in the past
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
but our interpretation is that after 655
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
and sort of the unification of the
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
processes of boards that became an oplc
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
process I right we are the ones all the
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
boards fall under us we have all those
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
records physically electronically
 
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
so we follow the same process now
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
I as long as I've been here that has
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
been the way it has never been a
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
specific board sort of retention piece
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
when we look towards the individual
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
statutes for things like what could be
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
revealed to law enforcement for cases
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing maybe but not as far
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
as record retention policy keeping
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
things for seven years you know how we
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
archive those types of
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
things um
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
and and I I can I add one more thing to
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
is that the reason we we also did that
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
policy and worked with archives is
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
place representative grda and then
 
02:04:36.549 --> 02:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
menipu and then goalie thank you U Mr
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
osterhout I'm going to challenge you a
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
little bit on that um because I don't
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
believe that I'm hoping that the answer
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
after 655 is that all boards keep their
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
records in the office but I don't
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
believe that that's the case I think
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
that some boards have their records out
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the office which concerns me because
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's some of that is confidential
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
information and should be part of the
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
record retention so can you confirm with
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
me that those records are solely held in
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
the office and not sitting around
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's credenza somewhere they
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be sitting around
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
somebody's credena somewhere we have
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
fought very hard and I will use the word
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
fight because it's been a challenge um
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
but we did have individuals in the past
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
who had as you said records kept in
 
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
their garage in their wherever uh that's
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
something we are strongly strongly
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
against they're not all going to be
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
physically present at 7 Eagle Square
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
because they also go to archives for the
 
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
state and so those are maintaining
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
course right
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
so I would love to say
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
100% that you're not aware of of if we
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
became aware of we would try to track
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
those down but I would like to say it's
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
100% because it has been a big push for
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
us to get the records and if anybody
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
knows of a board member or individual
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
who doesn't or is keeping confidential
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
information in their garage please tell
 
02:06:07.709 --> 02:06:07.719 align:start position:0%
me so I can track that down uh there is
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
another exception for individuals
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
working for us
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
for Contracting with the state um they
 
02:06:21.549 --> 02:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
might be looking at files for um for
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary purposes um but we still
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know we have those locked down
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're maintained
 
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
confidentially and we get them back so
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
that would be the only instance I can
 
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
think of where it wouldn't either be at
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
the office or with archives follow
 
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
follow up so is that um requirement that
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
the office has control over the files in
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
statute I think it is I think it's in
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 3
 
02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.149 align:start position:0%
RSA 3
31

02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
31
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
41e maintenance of the official so it's
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
the um duties of the executive director
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the official record of
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
the office and the boards in accordance
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
with the retention policy established by
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
the office and that is the policy we
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
worked with uh Secretary of State and
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
I and I'm also using that language to
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
get us the authority it's my
 
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation that language gives us
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
the authority to create that unified
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
boards good representative
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Mani here um thank you for taking my
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
question um in terms of recordkeeping
 
02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
you said you know it's partially
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
physical as well as electronic and
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
you're also uh you mentioned that it's
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
going to be scanned uh and so ultimately
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
records even if the application comes in
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
as a physical you're scanning it it's
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
stored rest you know archiving it is
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
electronic I think so for one it takes
 
02:08:15.629 --> 02:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
up a lot of less space but also for
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
things like right to know it makes right
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
to know request and are answering them
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
much easier right so we can rather than
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
go dig through the boxes we can look on
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
the folder if there's any redactions
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be made we can do it on the
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
Fly and then we can send a response to
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
an individual electronically rather than
 
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
have them come through go through
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
archives come to the office dig through
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
everything have someone sit with them I
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
think it's it's better in the long run
 
02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
for everyone um if we if we can move
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
them all to electronic so I think that
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
is the goal yes
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow I'm trying to find the parallel
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of electronic medical record so
 
02:08:59.709 --> 02:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
now all the medical records are
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
electronic whether it's filled out or
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
whatever and we get the chart access to
 
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
our file as an individual so similarly
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
to follow where your tracking is where
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
the process is in your terms of
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
Licensing who has it where is it kind of
 
02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:19.229 align:start position:0%
Licensing who has it where is it kind of
thing

02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
is that the goal of OPC to maintain
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
electronic and the process so there's a
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
transparency in terms of the process we
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
chair it's like these mics are on a
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
Monday and just trying to wake
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
up I
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
noticed uh going to section
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
three and you being an attorney I'm
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these changes made in
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
section three looks like just a
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
semantics and wording you're really not
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
changing much other than someone's
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
personal preference on how they feel it
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
should be worded um can you tell me is
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
there really need for changing um I will
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
say first of all lines 14 and 15 um
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
version of the rule where it says which
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
the director shall publish online when
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
right after it it was already in the
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
statute that the director sh published
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
online I feel I think that probably gets
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
you to the same place
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately I don't have strong opinions
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
on it either
 
02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:45.620 align:start position:0%
way and going down
 
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.750 align:start position:0%
way and going down
[Music]

02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
to we'll do this same thing on lines 19
 
02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
through uh 23 um I understand putting in
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
the publishing or editing on line 20
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
process shall be shall notify the
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
director and I don't know why we need
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
who shall make where it says such
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
changes shall be made by the director
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're an original statute and I don't
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
know can tell me why it would be and the
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
rule shall be certified by the agency
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
when we're already talking about the
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
rule at the beginning of the
 
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
sentence I I I'm just looking at these
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
editings and it seems like we're people
 
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
are trying to make changes that really
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
don't need to be making work for
 
02:11:27.149 --> 02:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
themselves that it seems like it's
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing and then I'll go
 
02:11:29.679 --> 02:11:31.750 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing and then I'll go
down

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
to line 24 agencies has reviewed the
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
edited language and agreed that is
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
certified version and then taking out
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
the anshell to put which be
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
published online by the
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
director I mean I think the and shall be
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
published online by the director is what
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking for so I'm not sure why
 
02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.109 align:start position:0%
we're looking for so I'm not sure why
that's

02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
struck this wasn't my language right so
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
it's probably better for somebody you're
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
an attorney so I'm asking if
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
reading I'm missing something yeah it's
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
interesting um I don't know I I think
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
some of it maybe just to shorten things
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
up make it a little more clear whether
 
02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
it accomplishes something else I do
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
think that and and this
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
is there's there's a change
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
that how do I put this I have concerns
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes that rules get adopted they're
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
approved by jail car they're signed and
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
an agency adopts them and then I wonder
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
how the public is supposed to know about
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
that because the Gen Court website isn't
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
updated right away I think one of the
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
things here that if I'm reading it
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
correctly it would speed up that process
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
and give the public more access and I I
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
think I would be 100% in favor uh the
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
turnaround time on the agency is cut in
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
half but if we're talking about review
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
doing an editorial review of an already
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
approved rule that would I think be an
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
improvement for the public uh some of
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
these comments I I I noticed some of the
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
same things you did I didn't really feel
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
the need to address them here because I
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
thought they might be worked out um and
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
they're also they're kind of policy
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
decisions to me it was I read it as a no
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
harm no foul kind of that was my reading
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
on it um I I I didn't draft this
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
language so why the changes are in there
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that any further
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%

02:14:16.030 --> 02:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General at the
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um the department
 
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
isn't taking any position on the bill
 
02:14:23.069 --> 02:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
but we just wanted to provide some quick
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning to highlight a
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
couple minor drafting concerns and just
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
um one uh potential consequence of the
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill um so I think as you heard uh oplc
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
testify we did uh when we saw the bill I
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
think on Friday we did let them know
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
that notwithstanding any other provision
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
of law um in section two the potential
 
02:14:49.549 --> 02:14:49.559 align:start position:0%
concern there I think uh General Council
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
for PLC flagged that is just a crafty
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
argument could say not withstanding any
 
02:14:58.189 --> 02:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
other provision of law you said my
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
license is is revoked or suspended well
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's notwithstanding any other
 
02:15:05.069 --> 02:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
provision of law it's valid for two
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
years so that was the one concern From
 
02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:08.430 align:start position:0%
years so that was the one concern From
doj's

02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
doj's
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
perspective um in section four uh I
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
think this is actually just a um concern
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
in uh 54 1 a generally speaking but
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
section 4 addresses 541a uh section 19
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
and in section 11 and section 19 it
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
appears the statute contemplates boards
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
and commissions but doesn't contemplate
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
other public bodies that have ruem
 
02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
authority such as councils or committees
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh so that might be something for uh you
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
all to um consider and then uh the heart
 
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the testimony from uh the department
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
of Justice's perspective perspective is
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
sections 6 and
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
seven I think you heard this morning um
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know the judicial branch oplc and
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh Department of administrative Services
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
were contacted for the fiscal impact
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
note uh but the Department's read of the
 
02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:07.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh the cost could be potentially
 
02:16:10.589 --> 02:16:10.599 align:start position:0%
more significant to the state um it's
 
02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
clear under Section s potential State
 
02:16:16.589 --> 02:16:16.599 align:start position:0%
revenues would be impacted uh because
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
any fees or fines improperly uh
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
collected would be required to be uh
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
refunded but under Section six uh the
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice resources would
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
probably be impacted uh if the bill
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
passed uh because of the potential
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
result in an increase in litigation um
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
so as section six goes
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
over uh right you can now or the bill
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
would allow for a lawsuit um agency is
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
definitely going to be a part to that
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but uh the agency is potentially
 
02:16:53.469 --> 02:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
or the the state would be potentially
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
liable for a financial penalty and
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
payment of plaintiff attorneys fees so
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
you have uh an impact to the Department
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
of Justice you know litigation is
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
expensive uh both to the state as the
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice but then also uh
 
02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:10.599 align:start position:0%
covering plaintiff's uh fees so we just
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag uh and I think the OS
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
director flagged as well I think the the
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
title of the bill may not have um
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
reflected you know all the state
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
equities uh across Statewide essentially
 
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
um so we haven't done a survey uh or
 
02:17:30.509 --> 02:17:30.519 align:start position:0%
contacted other state agencies to be
 
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
clear so I'm not speaking on behalf of
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS or uh Department of Environmental
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
Services or other licensing or
 
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
administrative fine uh agencies but the
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
department just wanted to make sure the
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
committee was aware of the potential
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
impact uh so with that um I'm happy to
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you for your testimony any
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
Schmidt Mr chairman so uh uh you were
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
here I believe when I asked my question
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
about whether this is going to
 
02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this is turning into a
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger can of worms as we
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
proceed with the hearing so uh would you
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
be available if it does indeed go to a
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for your council with
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
regard to uh board smithing because
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
there there are too many loose ends at
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
this point yes representative the
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
department would make somebody available
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully me but certainly somebody
 
02:18:27.439 --> 02:18:30.270 align:start position:0%
hopefully me but certainly somebody
thank

02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
you other questions uh yes
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
chair do you see that there's a problem
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
right now for a person who may have paid
 
02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:42.709 align:start position:0%
right now for a person who may have paid
a

02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
fee under an expired
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
rule for them to get
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
say representative I'm not quite sure
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
I'm tracking but I I think I would go
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
back to
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
opl's council's comment where if it's a
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
fee for a license and they they were
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
license it's not yes it's all of us
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
sorry yes um I I'm not sure that's a a
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
question of Justice if
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
if the license was in fact issued right
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
if there's a processing um requirement
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
right I I just got my license renewed my
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
driver's license renewed and you know it
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
cost me geez I should know but it cost
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
me some some fee and uh and I got my
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
license now if the rule had been expired
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe I could demand from the state
 
02:19:39.469 --> 02:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
agency the issuance of the license
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
without having paid the fee um but I
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
think that's a a little separate of a
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
question than um than administrative
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
fine but I do want to say that a
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice's perspective uh
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're not here to comment on the policy
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
know certainly sir seeing of other
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much certainly
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%

02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair members of the

today uh my name is representative Seth
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
King I representative I represent Coos
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
District 4 which is Whitefield um
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
Jefferson and the town of Carol
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
um I presented this bill um because I'm
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
a freshman um representative and during
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
the campaign um I met a lady who was a
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
small business owner in my town and um
 
02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
she had a we were talking politics and
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
she had an off-handed comment where she
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
said her husband is a plumber and he
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
would love to um have more apprentices
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
if he could but he's only allowed one at
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
a time so um I decided to look into that
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
further I asked OS um you know what
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
statute that was in and um they taught
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
me that it's not actually in statute
 
02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
what they do is um uh we the legislative
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
body have given authority to oplc to
 
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
make rules on how many uh apprentices
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
plumbers are allowed to have at any one
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
time and um they have actually chosen uh
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
to only allow one Apprentice per
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
licensed plumber um I sent out the rule
 
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
to everybody here um it's actually the
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
third highlighted part um it's towards
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page um and it
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
explains there there's the there's the
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
rule for you um and it is my opinion
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
that um that number is far too low so I
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
can't speak for people in the southern
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
part of the state although I have heard
 
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh similar complaints but I promise you
 
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
that up north in Northern New Hampshire
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
it is exceedingly difficult to find uh
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
plumbers when you need them um even if
 
02:23:49.389 --> 02:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
you have an emergency it can be very
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to get somebody to come out um
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
and um I would stipulate that the reason
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
is is because for too long we have had
 
02:23:58.319 --> 02:23:59.150 align:start position:0%
is is because for too long we have had
an

02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
artificial um shortage on how many new
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
plumbers can be trained and brought into
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
the system so what my bill does is it
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
increases the number to three now the if
 
02:24:15.389 --> 02:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
you read the language of my bill um it
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
can seem a little confusing first glance
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
um I just want to explain that this bill
 
02:24:25.469 --> 02:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
does not mandate any licensed plumber
 
02:24:29.230 --> 02:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
from having three uh apprentices at one
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
any one time matter of fact um you could
 
02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
have no apprentices if you so choose
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it tells oplc
 
02:24:39.790 --> 02:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
that they still have the authority to
 
02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
determine how many plumers a licensed
 
02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
plumber or apprentices a licensed
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
plumber can have but that they cannot
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
have that number any less than three so
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
a plumber can have one Apprentice zero
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
apprentices two three um and maybe in
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
the future oplc will say you can have
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
four or five I highly doubt that's going
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
to happen they're probably if they have
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
for so long kept it at one they're
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
probably always going to keep it at
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
three but um this at least says from now
 
02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
on plumbers licensed plumbers will be
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
able to have up to three apprentices and
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be a Panacea this
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
isn't going to solve overnight all of
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
are Plumbing you know shortages but I
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
think that um in the long run this will
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of the problems we have
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
um with people finding um plumbers in
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
their area um furthermore um this will
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
also help
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
to um create more open jobs for people
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
just getting started in the workforce
 
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know if you're young individual and
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
you want to become a professional
 
02:25:47.269 --> 02:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
something in the skilled you know labor
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
market um you know Plumbing might not be
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
an option for you if you cannot find
 
02:25:56.269 --> 02:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who can train you if um if you
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
can't become an apprentice anywhere then
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do something
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
else and that something else might not
 
02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
pay as well it might not be your passion
 
02:26:07.710 --> 02:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
um so so I think that this is going to
 
02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
help increase the number of jobs for
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
plumbers and I think it's going to help
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
um the rest of us get plumbers when we
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
need them um I'd like to address one
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that may come up I'm not
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
sure who else is going to speak but um
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
interestingly and this was I think
 
02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
completely coincidental um that the
 
02:26:30.030 --> 02:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
Senate um has a bill almost exactly like
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
mine um Senator uh Keith Murphy put up a
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill um which is exactly like mine but
 
02:26:41.269 --> 02:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
it says two instead of three and um the
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
day that he uh was going to testify on
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
that bill uh before his Senate committee
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
I talked to him about it and he said he
 
02:26:49.150 --> 02:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
would prefer my bill quite frankly but
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
he went uh a little bit more
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
conservative just in the hopes that it
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
might pass I'm optimistic uh mine will
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
pass as well but um uh he spoke on it in
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
in his committee and then there were a
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
couple of people who spoke against it
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to address um them
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
because I don't know if they'll speak
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
again or if somebody similarly will
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
speak but um the day that they spoke in
 
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
front of the senate committee they said
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
they had just gotten the bill like 25
 
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
minutes earlier they didn't really have
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
time to wrap their heads around it but
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
they were against it because they were
 
02:27:24.269 --> 02:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
afraid that this might put them um out
 
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the Department of
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
Labor and they didn't specify which rule
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
would put them out of compliance with
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor i' I'd like to
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
learn if that's the case but I I I
 
02:27:36.429 --> 02:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
suspect actually that they just
 
02:27:39.389 --> 02:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the bill because I think
 
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
what they were afraid of was that this
 
02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
was going to mandate that licensed
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
plumbers would have to take a minimum of
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
three apprentices and of course that's
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
not what I'm that's that's not what the
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill says but but if you look at it just
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
at first glance it almost kind of sounds
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
like that um but that's definitely not
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
the case um and if you just dig into it
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit for further I think you
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
you'd come to that conclusion so I think
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that they fear was um
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
unjustified um but if there is any sort
 
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
of rule with the Department of Labor
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
that might put them out of compliance
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'd happily look into that and we can
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
amend the bill or we'll see we'll take
 
02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
from there but I I I suspect that's not
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
going to be the case when it's all said
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
and done so um I've definitely got many
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
other points I'd like to make as to why
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a good idea but there
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
are some um other uh individuals in the
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
audience that would like to speak as
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
well and I don't want to steal all of
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
their thunder so um I think I'll I'll
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
end it here I'll be happy to take any
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative gold
 
02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
you oh I can hear microphone's not gonna
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
cooperate here today uh my question was
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
did you talk you said you talked with um
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
op office of Professional Licensing opl
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
and um and so I was wondering did you
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
ask them about changing the rule no
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
actually I have not spoken with oplc I
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
spoke only with uh OS and I I wanted to
 
02:29:23.269 --> 02:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
pinpoint where that rule was um and
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
there may be there may be a a method by
 
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
which um individuals can petition the
 
02:29:31.230 --> 02:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
oplc to get it changed um I personally
 
02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
am less than optimistic that they would
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
change I suspect that they want to stick
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
to that rule followup follow up um I
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
would encourage trying that change in
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
the rule I mean I'm just my question is
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
do you really think that legisl ating a
 
02:29:49.950 --> 02:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
number versus the flexibility of rule
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
making and Rule changing is the a better
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
way to go well um I definitely didn't
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
want to write a bill that was going to
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
remove the authority altogether of oplc
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
um but I also understand that regulatory
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
bodies have a tendency oftentimes to be
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
overly conservative um
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid you know maybe
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
something happens and then it looks
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
poorly on them and this way they can
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
just be as conservative as possible
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
without that number being zero um but I
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
am a firm believer you know I've I've
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
lived in multiple countries I've
 
02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
traveled a lot and um I watch television
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
of foreign countries and um I have seen
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of states and a lot
 
02:30:35.469 --> 02:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
of countries around the world where
 
02:30:37.269 --> 02:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
their plumbers are fully capable of
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
training more than one individual at a
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
time I have a I have a very hard time
 
02:30:43.950 --> 02:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
wrapping my head around the idea that
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire plumbers are too inept to
 
02:30:49.389 --> 02:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
to train more than one plumber at a time
 
02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I'm sure the plumbers
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate your uh confidence
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative maputi thank you madam
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
my question is have you looked at the
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
community college or the trade schools
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the state that are training and are
 
02:31:12.030 --> 02:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
they having problem finding Apprentice
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
ship for their trainees in or in
 
02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
training especially for Plumbing that's
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
a good question no I haven't but um
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
based on my limited research um even
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
even trade schools are are not immune
 
02:31:30.349 --> 02:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
from this rule they they also have to um
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
if there's an apprenticeship they still
 
02:31:34.030 --> 02:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
have to have a certain number of uh
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
licensed plumbers in order to have the
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
same number of licensed or apprentices
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
Evans morning m madame chair and members
 
02:32:02.429 --> 02:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Ted Evans
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a licensed plumber I've been a
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
licensed plumber since 1978 or so
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
whenever the State Licensing program
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
came about I've been a member of the
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
State Licensing Plumbing licensing board
 
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
under RSA 329 when it existed
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
and I did help uh with the
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of the gas fitting
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
portion of the law that resulted in 155
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
15327 to 38 so I'm pretty familiar with
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
the operations of Plumbing in New
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was a contractor for a while
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
and then went to what we call the Dark
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
Side of Code Enforcement I became a
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing inspector and I did that for 14
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
years and the building inspector for a
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
number of others so I have experience
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
both in the trade and and as an
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
inspector I did training for apprentices
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
back in Manchester School in the early
 
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
90s uh I've done quite a bit of other
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
training for inspectors so let me see if
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
I can get the picture as we see it or as
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
I see it is that plumbing is not a
 
02:33:02.319 --> 02:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
I see it is that plumbing is not a
simple

02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
trade it's very very complicated you go
 
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
to one house find one thing you go to
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
the next house you expect to say the
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
same thing you don't see the same thing
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
and it really does require quite a bit
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
of training and the tradition has always
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
been oneto one that you pair somebody up
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
with somebody who is inexperienced with
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who is experienced and then
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
that knowledge gets transferred over now
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
the way the rules are now I uh I can
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that if you have a big
 
02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
company uh and you have 15 apprentices
 
02:33:40.269 --> 02:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
and 15 licenses there's nothing to
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
prevent someone from putting one
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
licensed person on a job and having 10
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
apprentices on that job with them so it
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't really goes sort of more for the
 
02:33:53.550 --> 02:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
shop than for any particular work
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
site and then there's a big division
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
between what we call new installation
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and service work uh new installation is
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
maybe on the simpler side if we can call
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
it that but service work and repair gets
 
02:34:08.590 --> 02:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
very very complicated because there's so
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
much different equipment out there from
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
so many different time periods that that
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
complicated so I'm opposed to the bill
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
because I think that onetoone
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
works if there's a problem with
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
attracting apprentices it's not because
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough opportunities for
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
apprentices it's that it Plumbing has
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
become an undesirable trade uh we're
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with human waste we're dealing
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
with things that are not pleasant uh
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
when I talk to young people they go
 
02:34:39.309 --> 02:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
Plumbing I would never want to do that
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
so there's some of that going on there's
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
also and I think others can talk about
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
this more is that there's a problem with
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh training uh opportunities not
 
02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities but training
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities if if this bill were to be
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
corrected I would like to see it put
 
02:34:57.990 --> 02:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
money into trade
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
schools and attract people in high
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
school for this kind of work because
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
right now I don't think we have that
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
kind of thing going on um you can hear
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
from one of the other speakers that the
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester School of Technology is
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
lacking instructors in both Plumbing
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
electrical and and by the way it's a
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
same in other trades it has nothing to
 
02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
do with plumbing being special and
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
needing more apprentices um the same
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
lack of workers or opportunity for
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
training happens in Electrical Plumbing
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
mechanical all the different trades
 
02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
trades now is taken a back seat to
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
computer study and all those kinds of
 
02:35:38.349 --> 02:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
things we have to realize that that's
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on here the other thing I
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
would like to say is
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
that the image to the public
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be that we have a lot of
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
inexperienced people running around
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
working on people's houses where easily
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh mistakes are easily made that could
 
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
impact Public Safety I mean that's what
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is Public
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
Safety if we don't realize it we have to
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that the homes that we live in the
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
buildings we work in there's a lot of
 
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
potential dangers going on and if we
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
have inexperienced people working on
 
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
these systems we could be causing a lot
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
of problems
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm really kind of opposed on this
 
02:36:21.550 --> 02:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
philosophically and practically but I
 
02:36:24.269 --> 02:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
think efforts can be made in much other
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
much better efforts can be made in other
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
directions that would increase the
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
number of workers that we need in New
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think I'll leave it there
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
and be glad to answer any
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
are with your experience in the trade
 
02:36:44.269 --> 02:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
schools are you do have you found that
 
02:36:45.870 --> 02:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
graduates of the trade schools can
 
02:36:47.269 --> 02:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
cannot find an
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship I think apprentices have
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
have employment opportunities whether
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
they're up north or down here I don't
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
know but uh the many the plumbers I talk
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
to would hire an apprentice if they
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
could find somebody who was interested
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
in committing to a four-year training
 
02:37:04.990 --> 02:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
program I mean that's the Big Apple
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
there is it's not a two week six-month
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
project it's a four-year commitment okay
 
02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
02:37:15.150 --> 02:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative Brown and then go uh
 
02:37:16.750 --> 02:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
my question so uh the the first one is
 
02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
very simple can Apprentice ever be an
 
02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
apprentice ever be alone at a
 
02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
job I think that the uh licensing board
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
has been modifying the rules on that a
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
little bit it used to be that the rule
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
said that an apprentice had to be under
 
02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
said that an apprentice had to be under
direct

02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
defition modified somewhat I think to
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
anticip anticipate that you could be
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
supervised by
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
FaceTime uh which is a wonderful thing
 
02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
that technology is great if an
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
apprentice runs into a problem and is
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
alone on a project hey boss look at this
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
tell me what to do with this maybe that
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
works but it doesn't install a lot of
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
confidence in the in the property owner
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
who's seeing this happen Okay and follow
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
up follow up with slightly different
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
question so you prefer a Ono one but you
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
said there are cases where there may be
 
02:38:18.269 --> 02:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
a large project where it could be 15 to
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
one so each individual Apprentice can't
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
be very specifically watched in that
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
case is that accurate I think those
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things happen on new
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
construction where you have a lot of
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
production going on and you have two
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
apprentices cutting pipes that are 10
 
02:38:38.590 --> 02:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
feet long you know that's not too
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
difficult but when you have somebody out
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
in a truck doing service calls that's
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
another story and you couldn't really
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
have a licensed person with two or three
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
apprentices you know you go to a house
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
and you're going to show up with two or
 
02:38:56.429 --> 02:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
three apprentices that's not where the
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
the model will
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
work thank you I'm sure that the
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
difference between a two-week apprentice
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
and a three and a half year Apprentice
 
02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:06.910 align:start position:0%
and a three and a half year Apprentice
is

02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
significant correct representative
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
Manti Madam chair uh thank you for
 
02:39:15.389 --> 02:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question you answered your own
 
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
question question in terms of 1: One
 
02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.150 align:start position:0%
question question in terms of 1: One
Versus

02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
Versus
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
1:10 and there are it's un it's not
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
uniform correct Plumbing is not uniform
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's not all Individual Services um
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
services at a
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
home so my question to you is is it
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
better to keep the constraint of one to
 
02:39:44.830 --> 02:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
one when there's a lot of housing needs
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
reconstruction renovation re building
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
when we need a lot of plumbers would
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
that help to expand this
 
02:39:59.309 --> 02:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship concern over that is
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
having more inexperienced people doing
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
the work that's not really the answer we
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
want to have experienced people who know
 
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
the code and know the practices of
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
Plumbing rather than having a lot of uh
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
trainees and people learning If You're
 
02:40:15.389 --> 02:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
Expecting someone to come to your house
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
and and fix something because you need
 
02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
to have it fixed are you going to want
 
02:40:22.190 --> 02:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
to have an experienced plumber or you
 
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
going to want to have somebody fresh off
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
the boat so to speak and and who doesn't
 
02:40:28.830 --> 02:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
really understand what he's doing been
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
taught some things but not as
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable as the person who has the
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
license I I would like to say that if
 
02:40:39.550 --> 02:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility of implementing a
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
rule that would govern the ratios on a
 
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
project I would be in favor of that that
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not in favor of trying to make
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
things more costly to the consumer or to
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
the to the Builder or whatnot but uh
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are other better ways I think to
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
get more labor into this uh field than
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
than there is by this uh Bill thank you
 
02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:03.550 align:start position:0%
than there is by this uh Bill thank you
representative

02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:10.429 --> 02:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
chair speaking of plumbing and the
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
trades and all that
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
is heating systems in included in part
 
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the plumbing trade or not doing the
 
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
piping and everything for no uh heating
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
is referred to as mechanical we have a
 
02:41:25.710 --> 02:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing but the mechanical
 
02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
licensing only licenses plumbers and gas
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
Fitters the gas Fitters are the ones who
 
02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
can install gas fired
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
appliances but if it's not a gas fired
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
Appliance there's no licensing for
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
that a a oil burning Appliance has a
 
02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
certification from the fire marshal but
 
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
followup if you
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
have an inexperienced
 
02:42:04.510 --> 02:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
person doing plumbing and they
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand the proper venting or
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
pitches to disperse of that stuff what
 
02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:13.670 align:start position:0%
pitches to disperse of that stuff what
could

02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
happen a lot of things can happen happen
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
sewer gas is a pretty dangerous thing
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's methane and it can poison us it can
 
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
also um cause um flammable situations I
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
would think um and you we're talking
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
about venting you were I think you might
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
have been referring to um uh combustion
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
gases being removed from the house
 
02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
Plumbing venting is important two ways
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh Plumbing venting um maintains the
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
Trap seal so that we're not breathing
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
Vapors that are coming from the sewer
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
from our septic system the trap in that
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
water excuse me in that trap prevents
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
those gases from coming up and if the
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
venting isn't done
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
correctly then the um trap gets siphon
 
02:43:00.670 --> 02:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
not much maybe just a little bit but
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's enough to let the gases come into
 
02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
that's enough to let the gases come into
the

02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
building thank you
 
02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
followup that would be considered a
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
fairly important safety issue to make
 
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
sure that those are done correctly and
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
having an eye on that individual while
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's being done to protect the safety of
 
02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:19.550 align:start position:0%
it's being done to protect the safety of
an

02:43:19.550 --> 02:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:43:22.750 --> 02:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
individual sorry was that a question I
 
02:43:24.750 --> 02:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
would say yes it's important uh quite
 
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
important uh and that's um the reason
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that we do this extensive training
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
for such a long period of
 
02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
simonk M thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:43:38.429 --> 02:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony it's been very
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
helpful um just for clarification
 
02:43:42.750 --> 02:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
purposes um within the context of the
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether or uh not you
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
want an inexperienced or an an
 
02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
experienced person doing the work in the
 
02:43:53.550 --> 02:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship model does the trainer
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to sign off on all of the work that
 
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
The Apprentice does check it before it
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
can be approved or is that a little bit
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
looser well I think you know The
 
02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
Apprentice Works under the direction of
 
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:04.750 align:start position:0%
Apprentice Works under the direction of
the

02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:08.349 --> 02:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
lensee so in some respects the Ling is
 
02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
taking responsibility when an
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
inspect long um I would suppose LIC he
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
takes responsibility for it uh but he
 
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
can always blame The Apprentice as the
 
02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
one who caused the problem but so
 
02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
there's that that direct supervision if
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
you if you're trying to supervise five
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
plumbers to make sure all that's being
 
02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
done five apprentices excuse me that
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
gets a little bit more challenging I
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
think anybody would admit that trying to
 
02:44:37.429 --> 02:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
keep track of five three people as
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to one is is three times as hard
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
followup so in in that case
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
um where an installation went wrong and
 
02:44:51.309 --> 02:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
and something happened a backup or you
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
know some the home owner's unhappy maybe
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
wants to Sue and you know has a case uh
 
02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
who would that um lawsuit potentially be
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
against would it be against the licensed
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
plumber Against The Apprentice who would
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
take responsibility in that situation
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I would imagine it would be
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
the company itself would be assumed some
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
liability but um there are also
 
02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
complaints that the PLC can take for
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct and violating the
 
02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:22.590 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct and violating the
code

02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
code
 
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
or list of uh of uh
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
um no NOS in the rules that the plumbers
 
02:45:33.389 --> 02:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do and not do and they
 
02:45:36.030 --> 02:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
can be held accountable whoever does the
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
work I suppose if it's if it's an
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
employee license who makes the error
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
then maybe that person can be complaint
 
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint can be driven on that person
 
02:45:48.510 --> 02:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
for unprofessional conduct so there's
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
that side of it uh and then the Civil
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
side that's legal and I can't really
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Madame chair so it uh
 
02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a difference between
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
as was said an initial apprentice and
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
someone that's been in until their last
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
month of their
 
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship somewhere along the line
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
is it accurate to say that a plumber
 
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
would allow that person to be on their
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
own as they following the licensing
 
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.070 align:start position:0%
own as they following the licensing
board's

02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
board's
 
02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:30.910 align:start position:0%
board's
rules

02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative thank
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you thank you Miss Mrs
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
chair um I yeah I come here I'm one of
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
the sponsors on the bill and I support
 
02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
because I'm also from the North Country
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
I think most of the people who are on
 
02:46:58.510 --> 02:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
this bill are from the North country and
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'll share a story when I back in I
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't know 2020 21 the sink my sink
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
broke in my kitchen the pipe snapped off
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so I called a plumber and this was
 
02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
in I think it was September of that year
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
and they told me they get to me in
 
02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
November so who can live without a sink
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
with a working in in for two months like
 
02:47:26.030 --> 02:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's insane right fortunately I have
 
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm the only male in my family for my
 
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
grandfather on down who's not a plumber
 
02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
and so I have a lot of people they don't
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily live close to me but I I
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people that I can you know
 
02:47:39.309 --> 02:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
pull the family card with and have them
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
come help me in in these sorts of
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
essentially a crisis if you're if your
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
things not working
 
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
and I tapped into that when this bill
 
02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
came up and I was like what do you guys
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
think about this and my brother who
 
02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
lives here in New Hampshire he was like
 
02:47:54.670 --> 02:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
yeah he's like I think three is probably
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
about the upper limit of what you would
 
02:47:58.030 --> 02:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
want uh just because it would become
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
hard to manage them certainly on a job
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
site you know if you have a bunch of
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
them running around he goes but yeah
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
definitely we could have more than one
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
he goes it's it's most of the time I'll
 
02:48:10.349 --> 02:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
spend time with a with a and he's a
 
02:48:12.670 --> 02:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
master plumber he goes most of the time
 
02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
I will spend oneon-one with somebody
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
initially in the early phase up of them
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
but then you kind of send them off and
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
then you go and check in on them and he
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
goes it it wouldn't be hard to manage
 
02:48:25.309 --> 02:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
three he goes if you guys change it to
 
02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
10 I think that would be a problem
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
because it would be really unmanageable
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
but three he thought was reasonable I
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
talked to my cousin who uh is also
 
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
plumber as I said all all the males my
 
02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
family are plumbers I somehow missed it
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
and which is too bad because they make
 
02:48:43.950 --> 02:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
so much money um but uh they he he's
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
like yeah he's like oh that's he's like
 
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's totally reasonable like he goes he
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
goes we benefit from a lot of the
 
02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have in in the
 
02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
plumbing industry that drives up the
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
cost of Plumbing because it does it does
 
02:48:58.910 --> 02:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
keep down the cap of plumbers whether
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's the Apprentice program whether it's
 
02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
the number of hours needed there's a lot
 
02:49:05.550 --> 02:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
of regulations there that perhaps are
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
are overly conservative as as
 
02:49:09.469 --> 02:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative King has suggested when
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
he was giving his testimony um but
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
another another point that when I was
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
talking to my brother in great detail
 
02:49:19.469 --> 02:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
about this last week and he he said he
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
was yeah he's like you know one of the
 
02:49:22.229 --> 02:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
good things that would be good about
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is if I could have three come on
 
02:49:27.229 --> 02:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
because the problem is is is as as the
 
02:49:28.830 --> 02:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said a lot of people
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to do trades right now so
 
02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
they come in and then they do it for a
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
month or two and then they drop out and
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
then they have to start over he if I had
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
three and I have one or two drop out at
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
least I still have one who might make it
 
02:49:40.990 --> 02:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
through the whole program it really
 
02:49:43.229 --> 02:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
increases your odds and he said that's
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
where I think this matters the most most
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
he said the biggest problem is is if we
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
could only have one right now they they
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
often don't last more than a month or
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
two and they don't like that and I know
 
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
the plumber that I use I live I
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent Bethlehem and I own a property
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
in Littleton and I had the local plumber
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
there and I spoke to them about it and
 
02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
when they heard that I have a lot of
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
family and plumbing they asked if I
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to become a plumber to work for
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
them and so I do think that there's a
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem with trying to recruit to the
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
previous gentleman who spoke I think
 
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's a big problem with with getting
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
kids today to want to do that that
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's just not easy to do and so I I I
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate that but if you
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
have two who are willing in that moment
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if you could take both of
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
them in that moment and I'm not sure
 
02:50:30.429 --> 02:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
that that's going to happen often that
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
you could take two or three at a time
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
because I don't know that there's a you
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
know the supply of people who are
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
willing to do it but if that opportunity
 
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
presents and a good a high percentage of
 
02:50:41.469 --> 02:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
them drop out it would be really
 
02:50:44.349 --> 02:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
shameful to think that you know we we
 
02:50:45.950 --> 02:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
only only could take one to have them
 
02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
waste three months of time and then have
 
02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
to start the whole process over again if
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
we really do want to increase the
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
pipeline what we need to do is give the
 
02:50:56.910 --> 02:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
tool and the flexibility among these
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
these companies and again what's
 
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
important and I think this really
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
important to remember this this does not
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
require anybody to change the way
 
02:51:04.510 --> 02:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're currently operating their
 
02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
business but if you are somebody like my
 
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
brother who thinks having three would
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
not be a problem then they could do that
 
02:51:12.990 --> 02:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
and then they could manage the three and
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
then when one or two of them drops out
 
02:51:16.269 --> 02:51:16.279 align:start position:0%
we still have an extra plumber going
 
02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
through the program and that benefits
 
02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
all of us because as we all know at
 
02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
least for me I think the biggest problem
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
facing the state is the shortage of
 
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
Housing and one of the reasons why we
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of housing is we don't
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
have enough people trained to build
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
houses and construct houses and we have
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
an aging state so a lot of the people in
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
the trade specifically are retiring and
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
there's not young bodies coming in to
 
02:51:40.110 --> 02:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
sort of fill in the Gap so I really hope
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
that you guys take this cons this this
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty small change but I hope
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
that you guys really take it seriously I
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
really do think it has a potential to
 
02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
you know move move the ball in the right
 
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
direction in terms of reducing the cost
 
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
of constructing houses and getting
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
people to to fix things when when they
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
break like my sink that would have taken
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
two months if I hadn't had connections
 
02:52:03.389 --> 02:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'll take any
 
02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent man py
 
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you answered some
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
of that but I want to ask how are the
 
02:52:15.389 --> 02:52:15.399 align:start position:0%
other neighboring states doing this have
 
02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
you checked if it is one-on-one or uh
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
more than one Apprentice I know in
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont it's different so I texted my
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
cousin as I was sitting here waiting and
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's why I delayed my speaking because
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to to get back to me um so
 
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
I asked him he works in Massachusetts
 
02:52:36.229 --> 02:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire um but I think you
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
can now work in both now I I believe but
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh he says that it was one Apprentice
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
per per plumber but he believes that
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
changed it this year and he was looking
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
into it and he hasn't gotten back to me
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
yet so I don't have that answer right
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
now sorry thank
 
02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
now sorry thank
you

02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
followup thank you U Madam chair and
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
again the consumer at this point has the
 
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
choice I could ask for a plumber pay
 
02:53:07.229 --> 02:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
exorbitant price for an
 
02:53:07.239 --> 02:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
exorbitant price for an
emergency

02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:10.750 align:start position:0%
emergency
uh

02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
visit if I have a sink leaking and if
 
02:53:18.349 --> 02:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
that is not satisfactory as an consumer
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
I can say I don't want this coming back
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
or I can go back to a different one
 
02:53:26.830 --> 02:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it so the choice for the consumer
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
like you had for two months but there is
 
02:53:34.750 --> 02:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
choice right now to get whether you want
 
02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
Master Plumber T you know or Apprentice
 
02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
whatever no representative mapy that's
 
02:53:43.229 --> 02:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
not correct right now you need to have a
 
02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
licensed plumber performing work unless
 
02:53:49.630 --> 02:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing it yourself and whether the
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
M whether the plumber is a master or
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
Journeymen is not relevant really but
 
02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
they need to have a license or it's
 
02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
illegal so that it's already covered
 
02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
that they can't send an apprentice
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
without a license I know Apprentice has
 
02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.389 align:start position:0%
without a license I know Apprentice has
a

02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.399 --> 02:54:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
license

02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
I think what this would do to sort of
 
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
address your question I think you I
 
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
think you could certainly let's say you
 
02:54:26.429 --> 02:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
had a problem at your house and you you
 
02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
had a plumber come and they sent an
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
apprentice who maybe wasn't as skillful
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
enough I think maybe this is getting to
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
the heart of your question I think you
 
02:54:35.070 --> 02:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
could certainly reach back out to them I
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
think any like any business I I can't
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
imagine Plumbing would be any different
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
you could reach out to them and say
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
listen that guy did a really bad job and
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
I want you to come back and fix it and I
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
also don't want you to ever send him
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
again because I don't think he's skilled
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
enough I mean certainly you could have
 
02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
that discussion but uh I I mean I think
 
02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is is there just
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
isn't enough plumbers and so you know
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to be waiting a long time
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases particularly if it's not
 
02:54:59.790 --> 02:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
an emergency or in my case even if it is
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
an emergency you might still have to
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
wait months um so oftentimes it takes
 
02:55:07.469 --> 02:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
time to get an e emergency to be able to
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
to get things done and I could share
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
other stories from my apartment building
 
02:55:13.710 --> 02:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
that I own and and uh it literally took
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
it to getting emergency point before
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can come and address it and so we
 
02:55:20.110 --> 02:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
need to think about ways and I I
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the previous speaker
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
said about expanding trade programs and
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities and and that's one of the
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
many many levers we should be pulling to
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
try to increase the capacity of the
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
plumbing industry and in the trades
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
industry more broadly and but I I do
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
think that this is an important
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
important I don't think it would be
 
02:55:38.910 --> 02:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
particularly uh dangerous for society to
 
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of
 
02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
expansion okay thank you represenative
 
02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
expansion okay thank you represenative
Vera

02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
Vera
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative Sullivan are
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
you aware of a glut of apprentices and
 
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have plumbers or is it the
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
other way
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
around it's it's probably the other way
 
02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
around um
 
02:56:05.070 --> 02:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that kind of misses the
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
point of this bill though because if
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
there was a glut it would be Nob brainer
 
02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
we should be doing this right but that
 
02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there aren't instances
 
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
where there maybe is a glut for a
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
specific town and they can't and so
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
people can't get in and we wouldn't want
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
to create that if that opportunity if
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
that does happen to create opportunities
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
for those kids to get into the program
 
02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
for those kids to get into the program
or

02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:56:27.070 --> 02:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
people follow you I don't have a
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
followup thank you that answers my
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
Trombly

02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.190 --> 02:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair committee members my
 
02:56:51.469 --> 02:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
name is Bill Trombley I'm from
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I um run or I
 
02:56:58.950 --> 02:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
have run a family plumbing and uh
 
02:57:01.469 --> 02:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
heating business for over 50 years I'm a
 
02:57:04.030 --> 02:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
master plumber my master plumber license
 
02:57:08.309 --> 02:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
is actually number one and um my father
 
02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
actually started the uh Plumbing
 
02:57:12.309 --> 02:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
licensing law way back in
 
02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
1978 so I could talk about this subject
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
forever in in concept um I agree with
 
02:57:22.349 --> 02:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
representative King's concept that we
 
02:57:25.950 --> 02:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
need more plumber uh Plumbing Apprentice
 
02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
the problem that I see that people don't
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think realize is New Hampshire
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a plumbing Apprentice
 
02:57:36.429 --> 02:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
program so period we don't have a
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
plumbing Apprentice program New
 
02:57:42.309 --> 02:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses the federal government uh
 
02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
Apprentice program the the Federal
 
02:57:46.429 --> 02:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor not the New
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor the
 
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Labor so in the
 
02:57:53.309 --> 02:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
rules and in the law it points over to
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 278 which is the um Apprentice
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
Council which we kind of all know it's
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's not really there and it's the
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
federal government so even if you pass
 
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
this law and you change this law it's
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
not going to make any effect because as
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
a company as a business owner when I
 
02:58:15.790 --> 02:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
sign up an apprentice this I have to
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
sign an agreement with the Department of
 
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
Labor Federal Department of Labor that
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'll follow their rules okay and their
 
02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
rules is one to one and this and it goes
 
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
on um uh past that so this is not going
 
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
to change anything because in order to
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
register as a plumbing Apprentice in the
 
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you must first
 
02:58:41.469 --> 02:58:41.479 align:start position:0%
register with with the state of with the
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
Department the Federal Department of
 
02:58:47.910 --> 02:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
Labor first so it doesn't change
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
anything um unlike with the
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
electricians um the electricians do have
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
a state uh State of New Hampshire
 
02:58:58.670 --> 02:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
Plumbing Apprentice program with an
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
electrician you can either sign up with
 
02:59:04.429 --> 02:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
the Federal Department of Labor or you
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to sign up for the Department
 
02:59:09.630 --> 02:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
of Labor uh basically what that means
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
for the electricians is if you're doing
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
a federal uh project if none if you are
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
not registered with the Department of
 
02:59:20.150 --> 02:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
Labor you can't do a federal project
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
okay so for a small company like me
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter but because I'm a
 
02:59:28.110 --> 02:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
plumber I still have to do that so I
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
agree that there could be some work in
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
this area that could that could change
 
02:59:35.910 --> 02:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
it that uh plumbers could have you know
 
02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
two apprentices three apprentices not
 
02:59:40.910 --> 02:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
quite sure I definitely agree with two
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
maybe three um um apprentices that that
 
02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
should be out there and and answered so
 
02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
just to answer some of the questions are
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
going on if you're a third year and a
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
fourth year Apprentice you're allowed to
 
02:59:55.229 --> 02:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
work on your own as long as you have
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
supervision from your sponsor this is
 
03:00:00.269 --> 03:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
the this is the term from the federal
 
03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
government they just want um you to have
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
um supervision and their definition is
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
any electronic supervision or anything
 
03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
else like that New Hampshire has
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
recently changed their rules in laws I
 
03:00:17.469 --> 03:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
think is December of last year or
 
03:00:20.030 --> 03:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
November of last year that a third year
 
03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and a fourth year Apprentice can work on
 
03:00:24.309 --> 03:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
their own as long as they're um
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
supervised by a journeyman or a master
 
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
um talking about the gas license the gas
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
license you have to have direct
 
03:00:35.469 --> 03:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
supervision all the time so you got to
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
also realize is the plumbing school is a
 
03:00:41.309 --> 03:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
four-year Plumbing Apprentice realize
 
03:00:43.389 --> 03:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
that we're getting more people signing
 
03:00:45.349 --> 03:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
up for for the gas license than we are
 
03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
Plumbing it's a one-year Plumbing a onee
 
03:00:52.670 --> 03:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
um for gas Fitters versus four years for
 
03:00:55.150 --> 03:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
plumbing so it's easier for somebody
 
03:00:58.190 --> 03:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
coming out of school to go get their gas
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
license I'm not necessarily agreeing
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
with one year don't don't get me wrong
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
um um but uh but that's what we're
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
seeing when kids come out of the the the
 
03:01:12.910 --> 03:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
the school um and I think there's could
 
03:01:14.229 --> 03:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
be more work
 
03:01:16.830 --> 03:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
like like Mr Evan said I was just we
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
were just notified that the Manchester
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
School of Technology they're plumbing
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
and electrical class um does not have a
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
teacher um for plumbing or or electrical
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
and it's tough to get a trades person in
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
there because I believe I'm not 100%
 
03:01:35.429 --> 03:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
sure but you need a teaching certificate
 
03:01:38.429 --> 03:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
to teach in that school it doesn't make
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
sense for somebody that is a plumber um
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
that you can't go in and teach Plumbing
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
that he doesn't they don't have a
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
teaching certificate I know that's
 
03:01:49.870 --> 03:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
getting out of this committee's purview
 
03:01:52.389 --> 03:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
but just to kind of let you know that's
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's what's going out there so in in
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
concept I believe that we should allow
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
more uh apprentices I'm just not quite
 
03:02:04.269 --> 03:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
sure that by changing this this here in
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
this law will will'll do anything
 
03:02:10.030 --> 03:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
because the plumbing program is a
 
03:02:12.389 --> 03:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
federal program and with the federal
 
03:02:15.229 --> 03:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
program the one the advantage of that is
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have portability is that if somebody
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
is in this program in other states and
 
03:02:23.229 --> 03:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
they come to United come to New
 
03:02:25.150 --> 03:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they can pick up where they
 
03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
are where where they left off the truth
 
03:02:32.510 --> 03:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
of that is probably um maybe I don't
 
03:02:34.510 --> 03:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
know the exact number but there's not
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
every state is on the federal program
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is on their own program um
 
03:02:42.429 --> 03:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
Maine is on their own program I'm not
 
03:02:44.229 --> 03:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with Vermont
 
03:02:48.269 --> 03:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
um so immediate area um it doesn't do
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
too much but there are other states that
 
03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
are on the federal program and they can
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
move from one state to another so I
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
think you have to come at it at a
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
different angle um if you want to change
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Plumbing Apprentice program uh uh
 
03:03:09.309 --> 03:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
ratios so I'll happy to answer any
 
03:03:12.429 --> 03:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Shu
 
03:03:13.950 --> 03:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello hello Mr
 
03:03:16.110 --> 03:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
trle it's nice to see you again nice to
 
03:03:20.429 --> 03:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
see you um would you agree that um a
 
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
master or journeyman plumber would
 
03:03:25.670 --> 03:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably make more money on the job than
 
03:03:27.790 --> 03:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
he would teaching and that might be a
 
03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
reason that we have a shortage uh
 
03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
probably but there's a you know there's
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of um good and bad things about
 
03:03:38.349 --> 03:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
the the the work in is you might see me
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
walking in here I'm limping I need two
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
new knees and everything else like that
 
03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
so um I I don't think somebody uh uh I I
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
would love to teach um you know some the
 
03:03:53.190 --> 03:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
plumbing is in the blood so people
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes would like to teach and money
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
is not always the
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
answer it's thank you the questions
 
03:04:00.359 --> 03:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
answer it's thank you the questions
representative

03:04:03.030 --> 03:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
chair so it was briefly referenced
 
03:04:14.110 --> 03:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
earlier by Mr Evans I think but isn't it
 
03:04:18.229 --> 03:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
the case that new construction and o o
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
older homes or you know existing homes
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
two different worlds uh and and uh maybe
 
03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
you could speak to the the the totally
 
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
different situation you have when you're
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
build building a new building a new
 
03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
building yeah the great thing about
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
Plumbing is is that there's all kinds of
 
03:04:39.150 --> 03:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
different as aspects of it you have the
 
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
service which is we're doing the repair
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
like repair in the sink you have new
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
construction um when you say new
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
construction you're you're building new
 
03:04:49.990 --> 03:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
homes and stuff like that and then you
 
03:04:52.349 --> 03:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
have commercial that is building these
 
03:04:53.950 --> 03:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings around there
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
they're all different types of types of
 
03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
work the thing is is with the with the
 
03:05:03.150 --> 03:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
ratio is a company ratio so I have to
 
03:05:05.790 --> 03:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
have one to one but if I'm on a job site
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm a I'm a commercial um type
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
of plumber I could actually have five or
 
03:05:14.190 --> 03:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
six apprentices with a j jman that's on
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
that job right now that's legal okay um
 
03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
that works well for their situation the
 
03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
problem is when it comes into the small
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
companies it's one to one now I'm
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
sending two guys out to fix a kitchen
 
03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
sink and you know um you know exorb fees
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
you know they're not exuberant fees I
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
hate to say that because you're paying
 
03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
for our education you're paying for our
 
03:05:45.630 --> 03:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge I'm sending two technicians
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
out on this job and yes if he's a if
 
03:05:51.269 --> 03:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
he's a first year Apprentice he's still
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
making pretty good money he's still
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
making 20 25 bucks an hour okay so um
 
03:05:59.630 --> 03:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
and then my plumber is making well over
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
that so you know that's where the cost
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
goes up for the
 
03:06:07.830 --> 03:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
residential um and I did utilize you
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
know or I do utilize the third and
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
fourth year yeah they should be able to
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
do something thir and first year you
 
03:06:17.309 --> 03:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
know I was running jobs when I was when
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
I was a third and fourth year um they
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to replace toilets no
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
problem third and fourth year fix a
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen sink third or fourth year you
 
03:06:28.150 --> 03:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
know those are things and I think we are
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
we did well when we got that rule
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
changed into December it hasn't got out
 
03:06:35.550 --> 03:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
to the industry yet it just hasn't you
 
03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
know the notification hasn't got out to
 
03:06:41.349 --> 03:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the in Industry so we haven't seen any
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
of that that effect on that yet yet but
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
um definitely I mean you know my good
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
friend Mr Evans and I may disagree but I
 
03:06:52.349 --> 03:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
you know I would have no problem you
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
know having one to two maybe one to
 
03:06:57.630 --> 03:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
three but um that would be a good start
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a major change in just
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
law all right thank you
 
03:07:07.710 --> 03:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:07:13.950 --> 03:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
no no I just have one for uh Mr if he
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
comes up he we will uh invite him to
 
03:07:19.630 --> 03:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
speak next I
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
right does anyone else wish to
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.950 --> 03:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
house all right then we'll uh since we
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
house

03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.309 --> 03:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.950 --> 03:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
oplc Okay representative lus you have a
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
question we heard uh testimony that
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh that The Apprentice program for
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
plumbers is just under the federal and
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
that um you know even if we were to
 
03:08:06.269 --> 03:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
change this to three it would have no
 
03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
effect because there's a federal
 
03:08:10.590 --> 03:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
one-on-one is is that your understanding
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
I would have to look at it more but it's
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding that
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we do have the ability as a state
 
03:08:19.309 --> 03:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
to go above one to one but when we do
 
03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
that we lose a lot of federal dollars we
 
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
lose grants we
 
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
lose the examples given to me were you
 
03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
know there's grant money at the one to
 
03:08:31.309 --> 03:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
one ratio where they'll buy equipment
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
for apprentices they'll boots belts
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
tools that kind of thing there's
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
education um money there if you're at
 
03:08:41.950 --> 03:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
the one: one ratio and again as Bill
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
pointed out there's the uh you can't do
 
03:08:48.670 --> 03:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
a federal job at one to one I I we could
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
go above one I
 
03:08:52.990 --> 03:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
believe in rule right now if we wanted
 
03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:54.510 align:start position:0%
believe in rule right now if we wanted
to

03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
but there that answers my question
 
03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.510 align:start position:0%
but there that answers my question
there's

03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
drawbacks uh I have a question could you
 
03:09:05.229 --> 03:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
tell us how many plumbers there are in
 
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
the state and how many
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
apprentices I can get that number for
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you I think that would that
 
03:09:15.550 --> 03:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
would be useful because if we're if the
 
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
problem is that we don't have enough
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
apprentices period then I'd be less
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
inclined to push this through then if
 
03:09:24.750 --> 03:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is we don't have enough jobs
 
03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:09:28.510 --> 03:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
apprentices although if the if the
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
problem is that all the apprentices
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
would rather live in the bright lights
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
of Manch Vegas than go up to Coos County
 
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
Brown M chair and thanks for taking my
 
03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:50.590 align:start position:0%
Brown M chair and thanks for taking my
question

03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:09:54.590 --> 03:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
um it would be possible I'm guessing if
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted to move forward with this to
 
03:09:58.710 --> 03:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
make possibly
 
03:10:01.150 --> 03:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
categories one to three and the first
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
two years they couldn't be left alone
 
03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
two years they couldn't be left alone
for

03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
example I think you could give the board
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that they they might
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
have that ability right now I have to
 
03:10:14.590 --> 03:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
look at the statutes to see what their
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
rul making Authority is uh somebody else
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
may able to speak to that but
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
um well if if this number is only in the
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
rule and not in the statute then that
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
strongly implies it's within their
 
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
Authority would say I would hope so at
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
least yeah well you're talking about
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
categories though right to be clear to
 
03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
be clear I'm saying we could say a a
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
plumber could have three apprentices but
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
the only ones that could be un
 
03:10:45.150 --> 03:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
supervised directly would be year three
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
and four for
 
03:10:50.910 --> 03:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
example it's already in there okay thank
 
03:10:55.229 --> 03:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you could also while you're looking
 
03:11:04.110 --> 03:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
into the numbers report on what kind of
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
Grants we're getting and how much money
 
03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:08.269 align:start position:0%
Grants we're getting and how much money
is

03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.150 --> 03:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
mean if it's a tool belt type of Grant
 
03:11:18.990 --> 03:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%

03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:05.630 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship uh I can answer some of
your

03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
questions um the currently for plumbers
 
03:12:12.990 --> 03:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the uh
 
03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board will not
 
03:12:17.550 --> 03:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
issue an apprentice card without an
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship agreement from my office
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
to get an apprenticeship agreement for
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
my office you must be a registered
 
03:12:26.429 --> 03:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship okay registered
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship is what we do previously
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
the state had been the registration
 
03:12:34.349 --> 03:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
agency but now the federal government is
 
03:12:36.670 --> 03:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
um to answer the question all of the
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
states around you in New England are
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we call State apprentiship agencies
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
we are the only office of apprentiship
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
or OA state in New
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
England um with that being said uh the
 
03:12:53.630 --> 03:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
idea is is that the uh registrations
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
occur we provide the information to the
 
03:12:58.349 --> 03:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
apprentice and the the sponsor of the
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
apprentiship of of the apprenticeship
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
sponsors are normally the companies that
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
that are involved sometimes they are
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
organizations uh such as the uh the
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
plumbers Union is an organization that
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
has a fairly significant program um but
 
03:13:18.229 --> 03:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is why currently the plumbing
 
03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
apprentices are at a 1:1 ratio because
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's based upon direction from the
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
office of apprentiship which is my
 
03:13:26.750 --> 03:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
direction comes from the office of
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
DC oh so it's it's all your fault then
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am okay excellent glad to have
 
03:13:39.309 --> 03:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
that that settled uh is there
 
03:13:42.229 --> 03:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
any uh likelihood of that being changed
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
anytime time in the near
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
future currently the policy is is that a
 
03:13:51.550 --> 03:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor May request a waiver from the
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
office of apprenticeship and so when I
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
say sponsor that would be the company or
 
03:13:56.750 --> 03:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
the organization that has the
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program can request a
 
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
waiver to change their
 
03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
ratio uh there are a number of
 
03:14:06.510 --> 03:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have to meet and
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to be able to do so some of
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
those things include their safety record
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
and their completion rate ratio for
 
03:14:14.279 --> 03:14:15.950 align:start position:0%
and their completion rate ratio for
apprentices

03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
apprentices
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
ah so that a company that has five
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
master plumbers and is currently doing
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
five apprenticeships could
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
ask if they had a good safety record and
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
actually their apprentices move on could
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
ask to go to 10 or 15 or 50 they could
 
03:14:36.590 --> 03:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
they could ask for a higher ratio yes
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
they could that would be uh that there
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
is a process in place for that thank you
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's good good to know representative
 
03:14:45.630 --> 03:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
mudy and then
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there in the
 
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
waer process is there any um special
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
consideration for undeserved or highly
 
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
shortage area um to get a
 
03:15:08.110 --> 03:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
waiver the waiver is based primarily on
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
performance safety performance and
 
03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
performance of the program itself
 
03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:12.990 align:start position:0%
performance of the program itself
overall

03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Labor as you aware
 
03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
of the US Department of Labor has a very
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
strong deia policy uh in support of
 
03:15:22.910 --> 03:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
under repesentative uh communities so
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's it's not necessarily a part of
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
the discussion but it is in there it's
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
available thank you thank you anyone
 
03:15:33.070 --> 03:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
Brown M thank you madam chair so is it
 
03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
accurate what was said before that if
 
03:15:41.710 --> 03:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass it would be
 
03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass it would be
irrelevant

03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes and you're still
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
registering apprentices with my office
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir we'll still be at
 
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
one that's uh definitive any other
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you uh just
 
03:15:57.550 --> 03:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
real briefly thank you for taking my
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
question in the waiver process in the
 
03:16:01.870 --> 03:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire historically um
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
when people have received waivers what
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
has that ratio been has it just been one
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
to two has it ever been higher it
 
03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
depends upon the
 
03:16:10.830 --> 03:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
occupation Plumbing specifically so
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
Plumbing I have not seen any request for
 
03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
waivers in plumbing from the state of
 
03:16:17.150 --> 03:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we do have a waiver in
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
effect for a different occupation and a
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
different company but I have not seen
 
03:16:22.830 --> 03:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
any go through for
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
plumbers well that's
 
03:16:30.510 --> 03:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh useful to know so that uh companies
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
could start ask asking for a waiver
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if they call my office I'll
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
give them the direction that they need
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
to help them thank you very much that's
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%

commission

04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
all right welcome back to Edna I'm

04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:11.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
um this would establish a committee um
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
to look at a number of things um to get
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
you know input from uh Native American
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire and others
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the big issues is
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
investigating um the possibility of
 
04:06:34.110 --> 04:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
State recognition of the tribe um
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
abanaki have been uh recognized
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
officially in the state in Vermont not
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and there's a number of
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why this uh
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
matters there's a number of um me there
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
are tribes that are recognized by the
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
federal government and tribes recognized
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
by state governments the abanaki are
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
recognized uh currently by neither I
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
mean bermont but in New Hampshire uh
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
neither and there's a number of federal
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
laws that can be of benefit to the epan
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
AI who are citizens of our
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
state um you know one issue is um
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
you being able to sell crafts I think
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
they do basket work and other things um
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
as abanaki and there's a federal law
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
that if it's you're selling that and
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's not you're not a member of a
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe either by the state or
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government they're actually
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
really serious
 
04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
fines um against doing it and uh my
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's uh that's
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
starting to actually be enforced and so
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
you have people who are you know Native
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
Americans abanaki they may uh produce
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
some traditional handicraft but they
 
04:07:40.830 --> 04:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
can't legally sell
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
it there's a written testimony which I
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
think was just handed out um from uh
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
someone who provides more detail on that
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
than I
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
can so that's that um there's some other
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
laws for example there's uh um there's
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
federal law on things like migratory uh
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
b birds and other Wildlife where there
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
are specific exceptions in place for
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes I mean allowing them
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
to keep feathers from some birds that
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be illegal otherwise and some
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
other uh animal materials but unless
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're recognized either by the federal
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
government or by the state that they're
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
in um that that does not apply and they
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
can't take advantage of it and there's
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
some other federal laws having to do
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
with uh Native Americans that again um
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
only apply if the tribe is recognized
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
and the Authority for doing that
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
recognition um is explicitly with with
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
the the uh General Court the legislature
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
so this is something that's appropriate

any is that any committee looking at
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
these matters would be allocated
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
adequate opportunities and resources to
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%

hello good
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I am Tina Daniels and I
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
live in Goffstown and I am an enrolled
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
member of the Nel heagan coak nation of
 
04:12:06.800 --> 04:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
member of the Nel heagan coak nation of
Vermont

04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe we need State recognition
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
because at this point all the
 
04:12:18.109 --> 04:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
surrounding states in New England do
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
recognize their indigenous people
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's federal or state
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
recognition and New Hampshire stands
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
alone without that and I do support he
 
04:12:30.080 --> 04:12:31.830 align:start position:0%
alone without that and I do support he
spill

04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
spill
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
1252 and because we have no official
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
state recognition it can be very hard to
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
get grants for cultural programs here in
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this is something
 
04:12:47.070 --> 04:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
personally I've been having to do so we
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
go to Vermont to access the programs
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
that are happening there and they do run
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
programs and because they can get the
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
art grants there much more easily and I
 
04:13:01.870 --> 04:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
just came back from one two weeks ago
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
that was held for two days in
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Burlington and they bring in instructors
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
from Indian instructors Native Americans
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
from other states to run those programs
 
04:13:11.279 --> 04:13:12.109 align:start position:0%
from other states to run those programs
for

04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
us and I also want to say that I support
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
1474 but I have another meeting in my
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
hometown this afternoon so I have to
 
04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
leave for that thank you and oh are
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
there any questions thank you for your
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
testimony yes there are representing gr
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
then Brown then man py thank you so
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
could thank you um could you kindly tell
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
us about these art programs and what
 
04:13:44.670 --> 04:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
their purposes are the purposes are to
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
to help bring back the culture that
 
04:13:47.199 --> 04:13:48.070 align:start position:0%
to help bring back the culture that
we've

04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
lost um for example the program I
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
attended two weeks ago two or three
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and it will be held again in
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
April in Vermont it's to help with um
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
weaving programs quill work which my
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
grandmother who was here in New Boston
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
and came from Quebec both my
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
grandparents they were big Weavers but
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
because they were actually born in the
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
late 1800s and I have her Loom but that
 
04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
skill was never passed on to me so it's
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
Reawakening skills that were here but
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
had to be suppressed because it was not
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
considered it was certainly not
 
04:14:29.710 --> 04:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
considered the thing to do I can just
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
tell you this my mother who was not
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
Indian worked for the State of New
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
70s and I was extremely firmly told to
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
never talk about it because she was
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
afraid of losing her state job at that
 
04:14:48.910 --> 04:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
time I do have my grandmother's Loom and
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
so these programs that come in from out
 
04:14:56.429 --> 04:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
of state are bringing back quill work
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
weaving Ceramics um anything related to
 
04:15:02.790 --> 04:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
our culture that all it wasn't just
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
abanaki but all Northern Indians did
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
working with um
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
birch bark everything like that and in
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
fact there is another workshop in March
 
04:15:16.510 --> 04:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
way up in cabat Vermont I'm going to and
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's what we can't access here easily
 
04:15:22.630 --> 04:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
because I asked the person who started
 
04:15:27.149 --> 04:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
the programs um Vera longtoe shean I
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
said why are all the programs in Vermont
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
because it's a long ways to drive and I
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
have to stay overnight and she said
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we can't get the grant access
 
04:15:36.990 --> 04:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
easily in New Hampshire and she said so
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
so for this coming year 2024 they're all
 
04:15:42.429 --> 04:15:42.439 align:start position:0%
going to be in
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair um can you
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on what um
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative Lea said when he
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
introduced this and we have a a piece of
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
information from uh a person in Bristol
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
who's in n heagan as well can you expand
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit on not being able to sell
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
products unless it's a recognized tribe
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
I don't personally understand that that
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
much because I've never tried to sell a
 
04:16:19.469 --> 04:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
product but Sher Gould who is also a rep
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a jured member with the Le so she
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
could probably explain that
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
better yes thank you if she's going to
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
testify we'll do that rep Manti and then
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm here
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm in Vermont do you know when this
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
law was passed and how they were able to
 
04:16:48.109 --> 04:16:48.119 align:start position:0%
access these are federal grants I
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
believe I don't know that
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
answer I would H I can ask our chief
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
because he would he would
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
know I believe they achieved State
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
recognition I want to say around 2000
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
um six but I'm not sure okay thank you
 
04:17:13.870 --> 04:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
if you could send us a note about that

Association thank you we come to you
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
today to oppose this not on its uh
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
principle of like it it has good
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
intentions but it seems to be quite
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
redundant and it's a it's a piece of
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that's looking for a problem
 
04:18:35.309 --> 04:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
when in fact the commission of Native
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
American Affairs has already been
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
addressing all these issues and and
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing for the last few years and like
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
I think it was Peter Smith said we don't
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
need legislators looking at our problems
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
we can do that ourselves and come up
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
with some determinations and how to
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
solve these things what is uh not
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
obvious to all of you that a recognition
 
04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
process is a very detailed uh process
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
that is going to cost money to the state
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
in all Canada if it's done properly
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it comes anywhere near the federal
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
process there's going to need be a need
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
for professional genealogists
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
professional historians and you can't
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
ask me to do that you need to hire
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
outside experts for this kind of work um
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
you can't expect us from inside the
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
community to um jury ourselves on these
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
issues you have to hire experts on that
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to if this goes forward with
 
04:19:35.950 --> 04:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
any recognition process it's going to
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
cost the state cour quite a bit of money
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly we do a lot of
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
genealogy and it's running in excess of
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars per family to prove
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
and vet U historical documents so just
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
be prepared for that as you go through
 
04:19:51.630 --> 04:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
the process because people will be
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
submitting genealogy and you're going to
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to vet that through Professional
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
Services the other issue is the Arts and
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
Crafts act which comes up quite a bit as
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
a tribal leader for over 20 years we've
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
Tangled with u Bia on this issue and it
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the original arts and crafts Act was
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
meant to be to protect certain Western
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
tribes and uh those that made silver and
 
04:20:17.070 --> 04:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
blankets and things and they've they've
 
04:20:18.590 --> 04:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
done a lot of overreach they've tried to
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
get into everything from Literature Like
 
04:20:22.269 --> 04:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
if you've written a book and you say
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're AB neck you could be fine but
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
it's never been tested in court where
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
how far they can go of this we've
 
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
Tangled with them by saying that we are
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
descendants of the Penacook and they
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
have backed off from any litigation
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
against us and we also question the
 
04:20:39.870 --> 04:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
sheer numbers of people you you're
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
trying to create legislation you don't
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
have enough facts in my opinion you
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't have enough facts about how many
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
actual oison and crafts people actually
 
04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
being impacted by the OTS and crafts Act
 
04:20:52.750 --> 04:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
and the Very fact that people have
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
Vermont status and they are a part of
 
04:20:57.630 --> 04:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
Vermont tribes that's transferable to
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
here they can sell the RS and crafts
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere as long as they have that state
 
04:21:04.750 --> 04:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
status so I don't understand the
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
duplicity of having to have a another
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
recognition in this state just to sell
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
crafts so in a nutshell I don't think
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed this time the
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission as you see in
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
1474 has been very prograph uh proactive
 
04:21:23.790 --> 04:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
to trying to improve the way it operates
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
and these issues have already been come
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
up and we've already talked about how to
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
process this and how to deal with these
 
04:21:34.510 --> 04:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
issues and to us um having legislators
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
play inside of our camp so to speak
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
speak is not necessary it's U it's just
 
04:21:42.189 --> 04:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
a waste of uh taxpayer money and we
 
04:21:44.670 --> 04:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you even table this
 
04:21:47.109 --> 04:21:47.119 align:start position:0%
or put this aside unless the commission
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
can't act to to respond to these things
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
in the next year or so so with that
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
being said this is already on the agenda
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
arts and crafts although we don't have
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
vetted authority to prove anybody we can
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
we can BR we can bring up these subject
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
matters we don't have any authority to
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
recognize any but we can at least bring
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
it up and try to come up with a game
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
plan how to deal with that and that
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
would be my personal opinion from a
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
tribal leader now as a commission member
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
right um as a member of the New
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on Native American
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh this bill was actually never
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
even uh proposed to the commission um
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we never received a copy of this
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill it was never brought up to us um as
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
a commission we're made up of um
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
community members as well as state
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
officials um that have positions within
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
the commission to give State oversight
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
and to give us access to State
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
resources um so adding another layer of
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
oversight to the commission um is just a
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
waste of taxpayer
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any thank you for oh
 
04:22:55.710 --> 04:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
04:22:58.030 --> 04:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
question the commission did not um re
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
and vote to support it the Comm didn't
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
read this bill and votee to support it
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
um 1252 yes no they did not they did not
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
support this bill I guess I was
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
misinformed thank you yes um chair the
 
04:23:21.070 --> 04:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
chair a an Jennison actually submitted
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
online testimony on behalf of the
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
commission thank you we'll have to study
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
maputi Madam chair um how many um
 
04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
different tribes that exist in New
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you have that
 
04:23:40.590 --> 04:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
statistics um specifically abnaki or
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
intertribal tribes
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
or just in terms of the commission it
 
04:23:50.349 --> 04:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
includes all of it correct um so the
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
commission is open to all residents um
 
04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
who have indigenous descent here in New
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
who live here in New Hampshire um so
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily represent a tribe
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just res represent um
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
their historical background as being
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
indigenous um we have Blackfoot Cherokee
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
and others that um currently serve on
 
04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
the commission thank you tyo the list
 
04:24:10.960 --> 04:24:12.590 align:start position:0%
the commission thank you tyo the list
goes

04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
goes
 
04:24:14.910 --> 04:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
on okay you know by the way none of
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
those really would apply for recognition
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
nor with u arts and crafts if they have
 
04:24:23.950 --> 04:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
arts and crafts uh permission they they
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
get that directly from their own tribal
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh communities thank you I don't see any
 
04:24:29.560 --> 04:24:31.229 align:start position:0%
uh communities thank you I don't see any
more

04:24:31.229 --> 04:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:24:34.269 --> 04:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
Smith Madam chair do you require like a
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
DNA test before you prove you don't
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
really prove so you I could walk in
 
04:24:46.109 --> 04:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
there and say I'm an abnaki and you
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
would accept that no absolutely not we
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
we deal with uh deep uh genealogical
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
research and you need vital records to
 
04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
back that up we're finding that
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
ancestry.com is filled with a lot of U
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
false uh leads and uh you need to have
 
04:25:04.510 --> 04:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
the backup you know Vital Records mean
 
04:25:06.309 --> 04:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
birth death and and marriage sit
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
certificates and typically in uh the
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
abnaki culture it goes back all the way
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
to uh late
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
1500s and when we engage uh genealogists
 
04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking in my case 15 generations
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
of research and if you just look at what
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
it costs to have a genealogist do
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
research on that uh they can only do for
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
$3,000 we've got quotes $33,000 only
 
04:25:34.349 --> 04:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
five generations of detailed you know
 
04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
analysis followup yeah yeah um I did
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
genealogy at The American Canadian
 
04:25:42.070 --> 04:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
genealogy Society for quite a few years
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
and everybody that came in the door of
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
course they're can Canadian uh or
 
04:25:49.990 --> 04:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
descent and they all said oh yeah my
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
Indian ancestor and you question them
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
and they said well I've got high
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
cheekbones so that you know enables me
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be a descendant of some Indian or
 
04:26:05.710 --> 04:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
Native American um Mo I think 99% of the
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
people that say that are not and the
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
only way I can tell them to prove it is
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
to have a DNA test there is no DNA uh
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
database for New England tribes that of
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
of any substance uh this has been a
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
dilemma because uh archaeologically
 
04:26:26.349 --> 04:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
we''ve always proposed you know any
 
04:26:28.030 --> 04:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
human remains we find in Hampshire to do
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
DNA but other tribal groups strongly
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
oppose that because we've been trying to
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
do this scientifically to prove that
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
there was some kind of distin DNA strain
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
that would have been here in New England
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
uh every time we've ever found in Ur
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
remains which is very infrequent the
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
last one we found was in Freedom New
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it was very very strong
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
opposition for us and we wanted to do a
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
tooth test which is one of the few
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
archaeological places where you can find
 
04:26:58.269 --> 04:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
DNA and the date of the uh human remains
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
were probably what 2,000 years or 3,800
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
3,800 years it would have been great if
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
we could have done that but we had such
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to it so the DNA issue
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
is still a very strong one but it's not
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
precise and uh uh you know we we still
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
look at it as one of the tools but it's
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
not here at that point we could actually
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
use it we go back Vital Records uh in my
 
04:27:24.030 --> 04:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
case I've got multiple multiple lines as
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
I do more and more digging but it's it's
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know if I had some old ancestors
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
that could do a DNA it would have been
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
great but I I just don't have them alive
 
04:27:37.349 --> 04:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
anymore okay okay thank you okay
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who
 
04:27:48.990 --> 04:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
1252 all right seeing none I will close
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:59.680 --> 04:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
car okay so we have a few minut minutes
 
04:28:10.349 --> 04:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go into executive session uh
 
04:28:10.359 --> 04:28:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go into executive session uh
representative

04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
grod yes madame chair I move OTP on this
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill I think that the com this
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
commission I mean this committee has
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
heard um testimony about this and I
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
think it's time that we look into it and
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
I think a study uh committee is an
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate way of doing that I don't
 
04:28:32.950 --> 04:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that we
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
want to take lightly and uh I I hope
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
that the um committee will support the
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
OTP is there a second representative man
 
04:28:46.750 --> 04:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
maner py do you wish to speak to your
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
second want to make a point about yes a
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
few years ago a senator in Vermont state
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
did introduce this and they have since
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
been able to access some of the
 
04:29:05.950 --> 04:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
funds uh specifically for education and
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
expansion of uh the tribe skills in
 
04:29:13.870 --> 04:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
including them in the larger Vermont
 
04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
stuff so I with that I will say yes I'll
 
04:29:16.680 --> 04:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
stuff so I with that I will say yes I'll
support

04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
that anyone else want to represent laus
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
um just to address one concern that was
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
raised about potential cost of tribal
 
04:29:27.750 --> 04:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
recognition I mean that's one thing for
 
04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
the committee to look into the committee
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
can't obligate any money it would just
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
propose a legis a future
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
legislation yes I would have to agree
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
that they're not it's not in the scope
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
to to start the registration process
 
04:29:43.870 --> 04:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
just to
 
04:29:46.590 --> 04:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
say we think it might be
 
04:29:48.870 --> 04:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile any other
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
comments questions all right then the
 
04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%

objects to consent okay we will not
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
we'll put this on the regular calendar
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I will say that my issue is that
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a study committee I would
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%

04:33:04.359 --> 04:33:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
testing I hear you I think I think it's
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the system I don't think it's in this
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
microphone but something is a little bit
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
um wacky today with our sound system so
 
04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Peter
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt representing Dover Ward 1 which
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
is Stafford 14 um and um I'm pleased to
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
be before you today uh with regard to
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
1474 relative to the commission on
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs um and um
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons I voted no on the
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
previous bill is well I won't go into
 
04:34:15.070 --> 04:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
any great length on it it wouldn't be
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I think I think we we
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
already have a commission on in Native
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
American Affairs in this state um which
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
has been in existence for quite some
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
time but it but it also has had some
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
problems with regard to membership uh
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
and active participation in the in the
 
04:34:38.670 --> 04:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
in the committee in the commission um
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
and so I think that we um we owe it to
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
our indigenous fellow
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
citizens uh to um look at this
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
situation uh with a um with a benevolent
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
eye not in terms of the great white
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
father um know overseeing the um the the
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
lives and and culture of our American
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
Native brothers and sisters but the the
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
reality is that we have an obligation as
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
as representatives to to look at the
 
04:35:20.429 --> 04:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
commission and see whether it can be
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
improved um in in its involvement um it
 
04:35:26.349 --> 04:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
already has a number of distinguished
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
people who who have served and are
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
serving um and I'm I'm not going to um
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
extemporize here on the subject because
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that where the
 
04:35:41.551 --> 04:35:41.561 align:start position:0%
prime people who are giving evidence
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
should be people who are
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
indigenous they don't need anybody to
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
help them uh deal with their own Affairs
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
their own culture uh but the commission
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
is intended to further uh the progress
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
of indigenous people in this in this
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
state in this area and uh we should
 
04:36:05.310 --> 04:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
strive to help them do as much as
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
possible so I won't take any questions
 
04:36:10.109 --> 04:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
because we have indigenous people here
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
we should listen to
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
pulo for rid uh good
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
committee members commission members we
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
um ad admin board uh my name is Paul
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
poer I'm the suer for the kak band of
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
Penacook ABI people located in Alton and
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
again I've been a community leader for
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
since 1990 we are in uh support my my
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
particular position as a tribal leader
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
is to support 17
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
1474 for various reasons uh I have not
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
been on the commission since its
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
Inception but I've uh seen its struggles
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh since it was um first cified and the
 
04:37:14.551 --> 04:37:14.561 align:start position:0%
issues you see in this uh drafted
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
legislation didn't come easy there was a
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
the commission met uh on quite a few of
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
the shortcomings and problems we' had
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
trying to maintain a quorum and
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining some continuity of of uh the
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
board and the commission itself and we
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
realized that there were certain things
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
that were originally uh legislated that
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
that were almost impossible to meet and
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
one of those criteria there was a
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
commission of um 15 people and uh
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
several of them are State uh positions
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
from the uh odds Council the tourism uh
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
Department of historical resources that
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
type of thing but we've always
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
maintained about a three uh vacancies uh
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
for reasons that are beyond the control
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
of our community or the
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
commission uh when you set up uh 50
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
um member uh commission and you have a
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
quorum of
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
nine you have to cut it back in half so
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
you start off of 15 and seven and a half
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that becomes eight and then you need
 
04:38:20.551 --> 04:38:20.561 align:start position:0%
plus one so it always was nine and it
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
made no sense because there was never a
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
full board ever uh seated so to speak
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
and uh it it that process continues uh
 
04:38:32.349 --> 04:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
during covid the governor wasn't making
 
04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
any uh appointments and it just got
 
04:38:37.470 --> 04:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
worse throughout that whole time period
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
And as it stands right now there's still
 
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
three vacancies we know we know for a
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
fact that the department of historical
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
resources has put in recommendations to
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
fill these seats but it's stopped in the
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
governor's office so that was one of the
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
things that was going to be suggested
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what the commission did was
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
to bring it down to a simple majority of
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
those members that were seated plus one
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
so it's 50% of those the governor
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
appointed plus one as a quorum
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
standard in the hope of moving this
 
04:39:15.310 --> 04:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
forward uh dmouth was always given a
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
seat on this commission but UNH wasn't
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the flash points we
 
04:39:24.189 --> 04:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
saw from uh the fact that uh a Native
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
American um uh studies indigenous and
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
Native American studies U uh curriculum
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
was developed on un and is a minor now
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
on campus so so un should have been
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
included in any process with indigenous
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
Affairs so the proposal was to add one
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
one of those seats which is vacant make
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
sure it is from the University of New
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there was also a concern to
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
not heavily stack this with one tribal
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
entity or another kind of like an
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
anti-nepotism type approach we don't
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
want everybody from one family so the
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
other thing we we felt was important is
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
to make it as robust as possible
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
with as much representation across all
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
the indigenous uh folks that are living
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
and resident in the state regardless of
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
your tribal affiliation it wasn't to be
 
04:40:16.590 --> 04:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
an abnaki commission it was meant to be
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
a diverse State uh residency type of
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
thing so that was the other thing that
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
we brought up and the other issue was u
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the original codification
 
04:40:30.550 --> 04:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
rested on federal statute which truly
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
does not apply to a commission that
 
04:40:34.750 --> 04:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any vetted of federal
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
priority to deal with um case in point
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
like child welfare cases we've handled
 
04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
child welfare cases since the 1990s and
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
they come from all over they don't just
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire they happen all
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
over the country when people get into a
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
child welfare case and we've been
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
consulted on um probably a couple of
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
dozen over the since 1990 and it it's a
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's really a relationship from a
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
community to that agency it's dealing
 
04:41:04.390 --> 04:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Child Welfare case and it's not a
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
commit issue just like the Arts and
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
Crafts thing we never really had an
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
issue with arts and crafts in our
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
particular tribe because we pushed back
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
we push back on that threshold because
 
04:41:18.910 --> 04:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's meant that we weren't competing
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
with other abnaki we identified
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves as Penacook right here in New
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as Penacook we're not
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
competing with some tribe in the in the
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
west that's making silver or or braided
 
04:41:33.390 --> 04:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
rugs and we didn't see the same issue
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the demographic
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
Graphics that supported any legislation
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
that dealt with just the the Arts and
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
Crafts act beyond that it was a cleanup
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
and this wasn't a shallow effort this
 
04:41:48.990 --> 04:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
went through Ben Wilson which is the U
 
04:41:52.510 --> 04:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
the state shipo who also is sits over
 
04:41:53.708 --> 04:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Native American
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
Affairs was reviewed with him and found
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
out anything that he felt needed to be
 
04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
done and I know the commission brought
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
in the AG's representative the the
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
commission has uh a permanent uh AG
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative that attends the meetings
 
04:42:12.670 --> 04:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
now and these issues were brought up
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
with the AG's representative and they
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
went through the word smithing to make
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
sure nothing was out of order and that
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
everything was above board as it was
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
presented and what you're looking at is
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
the result of the combined effort of the
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
commission outside Community leaders uh
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
the department of historical resources
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
and obviously the AG's department so
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
with that being said um this is really
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
just to update the commission it's more
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
of a uh a maintenance issue uh it does
 
04:42:43.470 --> 04:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
have an element in here where we can
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
assist on providing educational
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
resources because us as a uh a
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
non-federal tribe but we also are a
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
federal uh nonprofit indigenous group we
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
are eligible for all kinds of Grants
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in fact our
 
04:43:02.110 --> 04:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
tribe has gained significant amounts of
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
federal money directly without the
 
04:43:07.590 --> 04:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
Federalist State status it's because uh
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
they also recognize Native American
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits is a a potential uh grante
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
for Grants so uh with that being in mind
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
we strengthen the program thing about uh
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
history culture Affairs and Dei uh
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
developing educational materials as part
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
of uh the acts that were established by
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government beyond that the
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
rest of the issues that are federal they
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
were removed uh out of the Shia fact
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not commission was never
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
vetted for that so with that being said
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak for the commission
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
you pretty much said it all and I'm not
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to waste their time repeating so
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you we'll record your
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
support any
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
goie thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh page
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
two line 25 can you tell me why that
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
ours could you uh start the line because
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't match with any cross out on
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
page it's the very last
 
04:44:18.560 --> 04:44:22.070 align:start position:0%
page it's the very last
line

04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay the authority um The Authority
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
for U that Authority is really uh a
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority that's not a
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
commission Authority and all Canada see
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
I triy is pursuing Federal
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement and being very candid we
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
petitioned in the 1990s we are on record
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal government we're going
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
through the federal process which is
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
more in detail it's more in depth we
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
have to show continued governance we
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
have to show genealogical revance we
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
have to also show historical re
 
04:44:57.070 --> 04:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
relevance um so I don't think this could
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
be something vetted into the
 
04:45:01.390 --> 04:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
commission's authority to do the
 
04:45:02.670 --> 04:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't have the legal
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
authority to recognize or deny a tribe
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's left up to the state legislature
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
so so why are you striking the line that
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
says it's the legislator's respon
 
04:45:12.480 --> 04:45:14.910 align:start position:0%
says it's the legislator's respon
legislator's

04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
legislator's
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility you don't you don't have
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
a process do you right that so the um
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
that line was struck um I was told
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire does not have a
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
state recognized
 
04:45:29.788 --> 04:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
tribe and so the Arts and Crafts act
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
does not apply um the arts and craft act
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
follows um the recognition based on the
 
04:45:37.110 --> 04:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
tribe and where they are located so you
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
could be a recognized Tribal member of
 
04:45:42.430 --> 04:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
the Cherokee and um out of Oklahoma live
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you can still sell
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
your arts and crafts as native Ma you
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
don't have to be recognized by the state
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as um as indigenous
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
that recognition follows you throughout
 
04:45:55.750 --> 04:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
wherever you happen to live thank you
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
that any other questions represent
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you can't ask any
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative maputi thank
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
you madam I'm a little confused the
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
previous bill was doing just that to
 
04:46:15.070 --> 04:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the state commission or uh the
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
tribal I mean relative to to study the
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
needs of Native Americans in New
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the studies was to
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
establish recognition of different
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
tribes in New Hampshire isn't that the
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill actually states that that it's
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
establishing a study group of the in
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
needs of indigenous people of New
 
04:46:38.110 --> 04:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it actually doesn't state that
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to establish a recognition
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
process that was just a proposal that
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
was put out by the
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you we don't need
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
to discuss House Bill 1252
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
anymore but uh thank you for any other
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%

uh item three in the commission's duties
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
has been stricken but it seems like we
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
did talk about that to some degree in
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
the last bill
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
and why why would that be a good thing
 
04:47:19.230 --> 04:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
to take
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
out um the New Hampshire native
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
commission does not have the legal
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
authority to dictate who can and cannot
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
sell indigenous crafts within the state
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
that's covered under a federal
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
law so um the commission doesn't have
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
any right to fulfill that that call ah
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%

representative

04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
gold mam chair I'd like to move inim
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
study for this bill so that the uh study
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee can take a look at it and see
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
where it fits with the broader findings
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
they come up with especially on the
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
issue of State
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
seeing representative Bailey seconds all
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
right uh represent baile do you wish to
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
second okay any discussion comments
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions anyone else I'm sorry so is
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
the um the idea of the interim study to
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
make House Bill
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
1474 part of the responsibility
 
04:49:38.110 --> 04:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee inhouse Bill
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
1252 represent gold is that your intent
 
04:49:42.548 --> 04:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
that was my thought yes that that
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's some overlapping areas here and
 
04:49:47.708 --> 04:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
that um the study committee could take a
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
good look at how to best come out
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's strengths in this petition for
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
sure but how do how does that fit in the
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
broader recognition piece that
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's had good questions
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
about can I comment on that okay so I'm
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
not not convinced of that because one of
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
the things that one of the components
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
that I like about
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
1474 is that it establishes
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the Quorum and it establishes the
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
limitation of One Tribe for
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
representation so I think that those
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
types of things are important the only
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
thing that concerns me is the strikeout
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to investigate that and
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
confirm that before we move on to this
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
bill because I don't see an issue with
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
it okay um
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to say that I'm also not in
 
04:50:55.390 --> 04:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
favor of interim study because the
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
issues of reorganizing the commission
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
getting its Quorum fixed is and and
 
04:51:03.000 --> 04:51:04.750 align:start position:0%
getting its Quorum fixed is and and
simplifying

04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
simplifying
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
it duties and responsibilities is very
 
04:51:09.120 --> 04:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
it duties and responsibilities is very
important

04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh Mike I don't know about the deletion
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
since everyone admits that is a
 
04:51:17.480 --> 04:51:18.910 align:start position:0%
since everyone admits that is a
legislative

04:51:18.910 --> 04:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:51:21.310 --> 04:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility so the question is do
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
they do they need that statement in
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
their the definition of the commission
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
or not and if the chair will allow me I
 
04:51:31.470 --> 04:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
would certainly look into that unless
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt knows the answer
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
cuz he just raised his hand
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt do you have the
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
answer to that I didn't hear the
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
question the question is whether
 
04:51:48.830 --> 04:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
the excuse me the the deletion of the
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
statement of legislative responsibility
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
is because it doesn't fit in with the
 
04:51:56.788 --> 04:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
definition of the commission and not an
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to redefine whose responsibility
 
04:51:59.680 --> 04:52:00.910 align:start position:0%
attempt to redefine whose responsibility
it

04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
is thank you for your question I can't
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
get a give a definitive answer um but I
 
04:52:09.270 --> 04:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
and I did not ask for any of this
 
04:52:14.708 --> 04:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
language to be struck um uh because uh I
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not setting myself up as some kind
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
of an authority on any of this matter
 
04:52:20.830 --> 04:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that the indigenous
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire should be uh
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
tasked with and and I especially think
 
04:52:29.470 --> 04:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh inappropriate to go to indrum
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
study one of the major uh purposes of of
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is to improve the
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
functionality of the commission by
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
changing the quorum to a workable
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
situation which is not currently the
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
case so to the degree that we take away
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
its primary function we're neutering the
 
04:52:53.708 --> 04:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
very thing that that uh needs most to be
 
04:52:56.548 --> 04:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
taken up and to be acted on thank you
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all right represent
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and being
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
the one to bring up that subject of the
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
struckout language I too would like
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
further clarification to make sure it is
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
what it is and if at all an amendment is
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
done I would also probably once again
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
ask because as you proof this if you
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
look on line 20 once again OLS is just
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
semantics with wording again making a
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
change that really isn't necessary
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
meeting notices of all meetings and
 
04:53:30.430 --> 04:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
changing that wording is totally
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and I don't know why they're
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing okay um if it's
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the commission of the
 
04:53:39.990 --> 04:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee rather we
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
will defer the vote on this bill until
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
the previously scheduled executive
 
04:53:48.230 --> 04:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
session on the
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
13th okay so we will postpone this while
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking into those specific issues
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that's an
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%

by representative goalie would you like
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to your
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
motion Madam chair I just want to
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
clarify we're talking about 1435 no no
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
no we haven't gotten there yet I
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
apologize this is House Bill
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
1174 the plumbing apprentices we heard
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
this morning oh oh oh oh oh can I
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%

04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
a motion of itl and House Bill 11 all
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
right it's by represent gr seconded by
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative goalie okay thank you
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
glad she admitted the confusion before
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
she tried to explain it so represent gr
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
you have a comment I do
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
um although I sympathize with um
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who seek um apprentices
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships and can't find them
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an existing way of
 
04:55:20.390 --> 04:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
having waivers for um having um more
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
than one Apprentice per plumber and I
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't see this bill as solving any
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
issues that are um apparent in New
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I don't think that we need
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and I to um
 
04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
believe in the testimony that was given
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
to us that this is due to the federal
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
regulations that we follow by
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um one onone is what they
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
require um but there is a waiver
 
04:55:57.150 --> 04:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
available that it seems like not too
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
many people out there really know about
 
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
and listening to the individual I don't
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
think they've received any requests for
 
04:56:05.868 --> 04:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
waivers um so in my discussion
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards with the commissioner of
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
Labor about getting this word out there
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
to these organizations that is their
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
intent to make this known and I think
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's probably the appropriate thing to
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
do knowing that they're more than
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
willing to Grant the waivers out there
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
and I don't think having
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship increasing the number of
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
apprentices per plumber is the problem I
 
04:56:33.390 --> 04:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
think the problem is getting people to
 
04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship and I think that's the
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
bigger problem that we need to look at
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
maybe address in trade schools and else
 
04:56:44.510 --> 04:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent man you had a
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
comment I I do agree that there is a pro
 
04:56:50.708 --> 04:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
I mean the process that is existing that
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
is not known to even the experienced uh
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
plumber so is there a way to make that
 
04:57:02.430 --> 04:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
known or available is it only through
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislation or is there a Ru making one
 
04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
where they need to know that the Federal
 
04:57:11.708 --> 04:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
grant is not going to be taken away by
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
applying for the waiver and I think
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's the key point that I took away
 
04:57:20.590 --> 04:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
from uh hearing the testimony making
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
that waer program available in New
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can increase the pipeline can
 
04:57:27.638 --> 04:57:29.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can increase the pipeline can
increase

04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
the if even if five
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
plumbers take up the waer and they
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
individually do two that's increasing
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
The Apprentice at a very grassroot level
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
so I just want to know uh if that is
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
some way
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
indicated way to be indicated without
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation um no we will put the
 
04:57:59.350 --> 04:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
com comment that the waiver is available
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee report please because
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
that is important and other than that we
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
are re the commissioner of Labor who is
 
04:58:11.548 --> 04:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for apprenticeship programs
 
04:58:14.430 --> 04:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
will has said he will attempt to spread
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
the knowledge so pass the word to every
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
plumber you meet that's the only thing I
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
can say just a follow-up question for
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair so um will the
 
04:58:30.270 --> 04:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
legislation be able to get a report or
 
04:58:32.750 --> 04:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
whether or will we get a feedback saying
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
that way was went out or not or that's
 
04:58:37.868 --> 04:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
not a preview that's not really our
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
issue the there is a similar Senate bill
 
04:58:43.150 --> 04:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
that is on our way and we you can
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
consider adding it to that if you you
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
feel it's important representative leus
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then sh
 
04:58:53.230 --> 04:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
it I mean I strongly support the goal of
 
04:58:55.548 --> 04:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
this bill I'll regretfully support the
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
itl um partly the issue is uh you know
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
the complications the federal rules I
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that representative
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
goalie's effort to get the word out
 
04:59:07.590 --> 04:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
succeed and that uh I agree that we also
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
whatever happens with this we need to
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
get more people in The Apprentice
 
04:59:13.750 --> 04:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
program okay represent
 
04:59:16.548 --> 04:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair um I also
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the itl in its
 
04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
current form um I just wanted to add for
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the record um I did have a conversation
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
with uh one of the gentlemen who uh gave
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
testimony who said that although he was
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
aware of the apprentic pro program at
 
04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the federal level it seemed better
 
04:59:34.270 --> 04:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
suited for for larger companies with
 
04:59:36.670 --> 04:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
more people um and would be pretty
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
onerous probably for a small in
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
independent um plumber in Northern New
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to access so it it is it
 
04:59:45.628 --> 04:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
does exist um but it might not be a
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
great vehicle for everybody um but even
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
still it seems like there are steps that
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
would have to take place in the state of
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um before something like
 
04:59:55.868 --> 04:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
this could be brought forward uh maybe
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
more in line with something that the
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
Electrical uh apprenticeship program
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
which has access both to the federal
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
program if they want the federal program
 
05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
or to State program because there is a
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
state program that does I believe allow
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
them to have two two apprentices at the
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
same time so but uh not having that in
 
05:00:11.910 --> 05:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
place at the moment it would be
 
05:00:13.230 --> 05:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to use this as a vehicle to
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
get to the to the end goal I spoke with
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
Senator bery at lunch and he tells me
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
um the his similar Senate bill is being
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
amended to make the federal registration
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
optional rather than required which
 
05:00:35.548 --> 05:00:35.558 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense for the smaller
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
businesses and I think that is the
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
proper vehicle to address it rather than
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
having an ident two similar Bills going
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
through and representative Shu you had a
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
Qui uh in addition to um this waiver
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
program that needs recognition we heard
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
during the uh testimony uh even by the
 
05:00:58.638 --> 05:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
during the uh testimony uh even by the
two

05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh kept referring to rules
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
and the different levels of
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship that allow uh apprentices
 
05:01:12.750 --> 05:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
to practice more independently and I
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
think that that particular issue is more
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
properly addressed in rules rather than
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
this bill so I will also support itl
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I was kind of upset that the
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor wasn't aware that there are ways
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
to change the rules without requiring
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislation represent Senator Brown you
 
05:01:35.310 --> 05:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
have a question or a comment I just have
 
05:01:38.948 --> 05:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
a comment so I I'm thank you madam chair
 
05:01:40.830 --> 05:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very much in support of this
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
idea as representative Lea said um and
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
from what you just said your discussion
 
05:01:49.150 --> 05:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
with the senator I think that uh that
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
helps me to make my decision for
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
itl what I will add is though it we all
 
05:01:58.270 --> 05:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
seem to very simply say well you can
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
just go get a federal waiver well who
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
knows how complicated that is it's hard
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
enough to get a special exception in a
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
small town planning board unless to go
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the federal government and get a
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
waiver on anything so I don't want us to
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
sort of be Cavalier about saying you
 
05:02:14.750 --> 05:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
could have just gotten a waiver from the
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
federal government it may not be such a
 
05:02:16.480 --> 05:02:18.190 align:start position:0%
federal government it may not be such a
simple

05:02:18.190 --> 05:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
simple
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
thing indeed no question about that
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and then
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
gold mam chair uh well I will also be
 
05:02:30.390 --> 05:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl but your your remark
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative Brown and the fact that
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the federal official who was here
 
05:02:39.708 --> 05:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
before us said that they had not had any
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
applications for waivers certainly does
 
05:02:46.990 --> 05:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
not demonstrate that that it's difficult
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
to get a waiver it's especially
 
05:02:50.548 --> 05:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a waiver if you don't
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
ask for one um but the the the point is
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
that um that we heard from the two
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
master plumbers who've been in in this
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
profession for
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
decades that one of the problems they
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
have is not that they can't get that
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
they can't have more than uh more than
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
one uh Apprentice the problem is they
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
can't get enough people to apply to
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
learn Plumbing period one of them held
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
up the cell phone he said this is what
 
05:03:25.150 --> 05:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
the kids today want to be involved with
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
they want to be involved with the the
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
not just cell phones but modern
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
technology and they one of them
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
testified also that plumbing is a dirty
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
business you're dealing with human waste
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh and it it's one thing if you're
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
building a new building and putting in
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
toilets and and piping that's never seen
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
any content uh it's another thing if
 
05:03:51.670 --> 05:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
you're coming into my house or anybody
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
else's house that's been in exist my
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
house for over a hundred
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
years it Plumbing has been there for a
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
long long time and it's still functional
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
but it's not nice when it has to be

Hillsboro District 25 in
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
Manchester um one of my favorite books
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
is the Diaries of Adam and Eve um by
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
Mark Twain obviously Adam and Eve didn't
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
keep Diaries or if they did they haven't
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
survived today the book is hilarious and
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
a pretty short read you can find it
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
online um because it's so old Adam
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
complains about a creature that won't
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
stop talking um Eve complains that Adam
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
is aloof when they conceive a child they
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
debate whether it's a fish or a wild cat
 
05:07:46.030 --> 05:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
Adam insists on proving it's a fish by
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
putting it in the water obviously it's a
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
human baby it's good read all around and
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
a solid example of a category of
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
literature known as historical fiction
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
or romantic
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
biography um it was the night before
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
Christmas and all through the house not
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
a creature was stirring not even a mouse
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
you all know that poem um it's called a
 
05:08:06.910 --> 05:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
visit from St Nicholas the author was
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
Clement Mark Moore Clement Clark Moore
 
05:08:11.548 --> 05:08:11.558 align:start position:0%
um and it was published in 1823 one of
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
my favorites I think I have the whole
 
05:08:13.160 --> 05:08:13.910 align:start position:0%
my favorites I think I have the whole
thing

05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
memorized and it was in this 1823 poem
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
that more invented the reindeer and name
 
05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
them but do you recall the most famous
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
reindeer of all Rudolph wasn't part of
 
05:08:26.590 --> 05:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
the Santa Claus franchise until 1939
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
contributed by another
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
author so you all know that Santa Claus
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
is based on St Nicholas a Catholic saint
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
he was alive around 300 ad he was a
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
Greek of Greek descent and lived most of
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
his life in what is now modern day
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
Turkey during his lifetime he became a
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
Catholic bishop he was very charitable
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
but to avoid embarrassing the recipients
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
of his kindness he left goods and
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
necessary items for them in the cover of
 
05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
night and obviously this Catholic bishop
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have any flying reindeer uh yes
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
represent B don't worry if you could uh
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
focus a little more closely on the bill
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
at hand okay
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so a book that is uh the origin of
 
05:09:09.670 --> 05:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
many of these aspects of Santa Claus was
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
written by an author named Washington
 
05:09:15.270 --> 05:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
Irving and in his life Washington Irving
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
also wrote other literature that was
 
05:09:17.320 --> 05:09:18.430 align:start position:0%
also wrote other literature that was
historical

05:09:18.430 --> 05:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
historical
 
05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
fiction I know you've heard this bill a
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
lot chairwoman um I I don't know if
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day is another holiday isn't
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
it um so I don't know how many on the
 
05:09:31.150 --> 05:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
committee are familiar with the issue I
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
just thought I it okay um so another
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
work of historical fiction or romantic
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
biography is um called the uh hold on I
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.350 --> 05:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
screen so Washington Irving wrote an a
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
biography of sorts of Christopher
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
Columbus that in its time was criticized
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
as an attempt to annihilate American
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
history and this book is the origin of
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
the claims that Christopher Columbus
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
believed that the world was round when
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
everyone thought it was FL
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the origin of claims that he
 
05:10:06.948 --> 05:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
discovered new land that had already
 
05:10:08.190 --> 05:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
been discovered at least a thousand
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
years prior by a variety of other
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
explorers um and so so much of what
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
makes Christopher Columbus this historic
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
character is historical fiction um by an
 
05:10:20.470 --> 05:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
author known for creating other works of
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
historical fiction in a time period
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
where it was culturally popular to
 
05:10:26.190 --> 05:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
consume historical fiction but
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a couple Generations later
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
there was strong anti-italian sentiment
 
05:10:33.628 --> 05:10:33.638 align:start position:0%
and anti-immigrant sentiment in the US
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
as it persists today um toward other
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
groups and in that vein those folks who
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
grew up with historical literature and I
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
assume didn't understand what they were
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
reading was fiction um invented a
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
holiday to help with the uh public
 
05:10:51.070 --> 05:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
perception of
 
05:10:51.080 --> 05:10:52.868 align:start position:0%
perception of
Italians

05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
Italians
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
um so in reality uh Christopher Columbus
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
thought that the world was pear-shaped
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
in a time when everyone knew that it was
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
round and you could buy globes for sale
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
and and he was so adamant that it was
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
pearshaped because he was looking for a
 
05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
shorter trip to India for spices and
 
05:11:10.390 --> 05:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
Native Americans are referred to still
 
05:11:12.990 --> 05:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
today as Indians because to the day he
 
05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
died Christopher Columbus was convinced
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
he had found a shorter route to India
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
through the curve in the pair shape of
 
05:11:20.910 --> 05:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
the planet um so instead of a flat
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
earther he's more of a par earther and
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
um he never touched American
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
soil um the closest he got was Puerto
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
Rico which was only um made part of this
 
05:11:35.548 --> 05:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
country years after Columbus Day was
 
05:11:35.558 --> 05:11:38.670 align:start position:0%
country years after Columbus Day was
instituted

05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and when he was on that land and he
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
encountered natives he rode them for
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
transportation if um he felt that they
 
05:11:48.750 --> 05:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
were dishonest he would cut off their
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
hands um he sent them to find gold for
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
him in the
 
05:11:55.150 --> 05:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
rivers and if they didn't produce enough
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
he'd kill them and in the time that he
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
he reduced a population from a quarter
 
05:12:08.590 --> 05:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
of a million down to a couple hundred
 
05:12:11.070 --> 05:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
people and in his time his activities
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
were regarded as criminal eventually
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
Spain sent the Spanish Monarch sent a
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
ship um to collect him and he spent a
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of time in prison in
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
Spain for his activities in the New
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
World in India um so the fact that today
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
in 2024 there are still people who
 
05:12:31.470 --> 05:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly believe these fictional
 
05:12:31.480 --> 05:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly believe these fictional
aspects

05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
of this character a character not unlike
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
Santa Claus not unlike the Diaries of
 
05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
Adam and Eve where that is not who they
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
were it's just how this author has
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
represented them the fact that these
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
myths survive today I think really
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
underscores the fact that the
 
05:12:46.830 --> 05:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
Contemporary critic was correct when
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
they reviewed washingon Irvington
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
Washington Irving's biography of
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
Columbus biography and said that it was
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
an attempt to annihilate the history of
 
05:12:59.948 --> 05:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
America um so about the bill it leads
 
05:13:02.750 --> 05:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
columus day that's all thank you that's
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
a good I like history so I like
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
exploring it um and it should be noted
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
there are other aspects things that we
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
traditionally believe that are not
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
factual Paul Rivier didn't ever say The

War II my the town I grew up in would
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
have the residents would have starved if
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for my grandparents and the
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
skills that they brought with gardening
 
05:14:58.750 --> 05:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
and being able to raise livestock and
 
05:15:01.628 --> 05:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
feed half the town during the Depression
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
in the early part of the
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
war my parents gave me a work ethic and
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
understood the Italian American
 
05:15:15.390 --> 05:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
experience we worked very
 
05:15:19.628 --> 05:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
hard growing up and into my early uh
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
career in business I experienced
 
05:15:23.120 --> 05:15:24.830 align:start position:0%
career in business I experienced
Prejudice

05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
Prejudice
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination and other horrible things
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
we were discriminated against in housing
 
05:15:35.150 --> 05:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
I was discriminated against in the
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
workplace I still remember to this day
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
as a young woman in her 20s when I was
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
trying to climb the corporate ladder and
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
I had all of the credentials that
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
everyone else had and my manager said to
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
me we're not promoting you because
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
girl to this day that still res Ates
 
05:16:04.430 --> 05:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
with me Italian Americans have
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
contributed to this country however
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination still
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
exists and I'm sure the other testimony
 
05:16:16.990 --> 05:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
will be of the others will be able to
 
05:16:19.868 --> 05:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
tell you about the atrocities that
 
05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
Italian Americans suffered through in
 
05:16:24.270 --> 05:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
the late
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
1800s the worst lynching of a group of
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
people in American history
 
05:16:36.110 --> 05:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day to me represents a day to
 
05:16:39.750 --> 05:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
honor the great contributions of Italian
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
Americans that built this
 
05:16:46.590 --> 05:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
country and not to honor one specific
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
person Italian Americans are a proud
 
05:16:54.030 --> 05:16:54.040 align:start position:0%

05:17:00.070 --> 05:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
Spirit italian-americans built this
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
country and we want want to be able to
 
05:17:05.708 --> 05:17:05.718 align:start position:0%

05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%

05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
greatest Melting Pot and best country in
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
the world that's why so many italian
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Americans wanted to immigrate here so uh
 
05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%

05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
hanged no one has ever been accused of
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
the crime no one has ever been convicted
 
05:19:59.070 --> 05:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
of of the crime
 
05:20:04.590 --> 05:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
but this honor Columbus Day was to honor
 
05:20:05.948 --> 05:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
these Italian
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
Americans and and to give response to
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination that existed against
 
05:20:12.510 --> 05:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
these Italian
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
Americans and that's not to say that
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
others are not discriminated against
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
because they are but something like
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
this manifests that the country
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
understands that we're all in this
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
together Italian Americans Greek
 
05:20:32.510 --> 05:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
Americans Irish Americans were all in
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
this together and this day Columbus Day
 
05:20:35.920 --> 05:20:36.788 align:start position:0%
this together and this day Columbus Day
we

05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
celebrate eth ethnicity but we celebrate
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
for everyone we could never lose sight
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
fact I have been in these legislative
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
halls for the last 50
 
05:20:53.948 --> 05:20:53.958 align:start position:0%
years I've seen discrimination against
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
myself and I've lived with it I've also
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
seen the wonderful companionship the
 
05:21:03.868 --> 05:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
wonderful consistency in getting things
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
done together which makes a lot of sense
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
to me and indeed we should continue that
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
and discrimination against any ethnic
 
05:21:17.230 --> 05:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
group has to be put put aside thrown
 
05:21:20.110 --> 05:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
away maintaining Columbus Day is
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
important it's important because we
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
recognize the contribution of Italian
 
05:21:28.030 --> 05:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
Americans but in essence we represent
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
the contribution of every ethnic group
 
05:21:33.230 --> 05:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
group uh to this
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
country this country is built upon
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
bringing people together and we've got
 
05:21:42.990 --> 05:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
to do more of that we've got to do more
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
of that as we speak today you know the
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
countryes in disarray we've got to bring
 
05:21:51.190 --> 05:21:51.200 align:start position:0%

hearing others speak uh my grandparents
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
immigrated to America in 1911 my dad was

a World War II decorated veteran
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
who always told us kids the greatest
 
05:24:06.150 --> 05:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
gift that his parents ever gave him was
 
05:24:08.430 --> 05:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
being born in America and we were to

05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
Italian culture culture is being ripped
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
apart what I believe is a knee-jerk
 
05:24:19.628 --> 05:24:19.638 align:start position:0%
reaction of legislative bodies
 
05:24:21.948 --> 05:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um let us celebrate our
 
05:24:24.670 --> 05:24:24.680 align:start position:0%

relatively recent Resident of New

05:25:24.868 --> 05:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
years uh my family also immigrated to

05:25:32.830 --> 05:25:32.840 align:start position:0%

contributions both in terms of helping
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
to build the country to build major
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
structures and do Labor uh in the New
 
05:25:50.788 --> 05:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
York area as well as New Jersey and also
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the scientific Community it has been
 
05:25:55.868 --> 05:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
their dream uh and my family's dream
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
ever since coming to these Shores to
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
pursue the American dream and with hard
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
work uh and perseverance and passing on
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
that desire from generation to
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
generation they made that dream a
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
reality uh for me and I hope to make it
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
a reality for my children uh as far as
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is concerned I recognize
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge that there's a great
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
deal of Mythology about historic events
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
that occurred and were taught to us the
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
way they were uh in the 1960s and in
 
05:26:29.310 --> 05:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
that era however uh Columbus Day to me
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
is more of a cultural sign significance
 
05:26:32.110 --> 05:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
than a
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
historical uh recognition of Christopher
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
Columbus it's much more some recognition
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the contributions that people like
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
those in my family and many other
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
italian-americans such as those who
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
helped to build Portsmouth and resided
 
05:26:51.310 --> 05:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
in the North End of Portsmouth for many
 
05:26:55.548 --> 05:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
years until urban renewal uh decided uh
 
05:26:57.788 --> 05:26:57.798 align:start position:0%
to really devastate the North End where
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
most of the italian-americans lived uh
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
they were erased from that Community
 
05:27:05.310 --> 05:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
dispersed their housing was destroyed uh
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
and today it's simply an area where
 
05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
large developers come in and uh profit
 
05:27:14.910 --> 05:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
off of those lands so I don't want to
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
see the Italian American Community
 
05:27:22.350 --> 05:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
further erased from New Hampshire uh by
 
05:27:24.670 --> 05:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
eliminating the recognition of a very
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
cultural uh culturally significant day

oped in the newspaper talking about all
 
05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
the accomplishments and contributions
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
that the Italian Community has made to
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
this state and to this country um it was
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
well worth the read so I won't take any
 
05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%

Gallow I am an American citizen of 100%
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
Italian descent and I strongly oppose
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State House Bill
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
1335 along with any similar veiled
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
attempts to discontinue our state
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
celebration of Columbus Day in fact I'm
 
05:30:20.270 --> 05:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
urging the legislature to table this
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
bill indefinitely so we never have to
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
come here again to convince you of the
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
importance of the one and only American
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
holiday that honors the Italian culture
 
05:30:31.070 --> 05:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
and my native people's contributions to
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
the state and to the country at large
 
05:30:36.910 --> 05:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
I've lived in New Hampshire for 40 years
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
raised my two children in Brentwood and
 
05:30:40.590 --> 05:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
served as an elected officer in that
 
05:30:44.708 --> 05:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
Community from 2003 to
 
05:30:47.190 --> 05:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
2016 I am now a resident of Portsmouth
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
in Ward 5 October last year I took the
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth City Council to task for
 
05:30:54.030 --> 05:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
their shameful abolishment of Columbus
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
Day and replacement of it with
 
05:30:58.670 --> 05:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day at the request
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
of a group of misinformed middle school
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
children as if it makes any sense to
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
replace the Americans of Italian descent
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
with Americans of Native Indian descent
 
05:31:10.150 --> 05:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
of course it doesn't make sense and
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
literally pits one cultural group
 
05:31:14.430 --> 05:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
against another all the peoples of our
 
05:31:16.430 --> 05:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
nation have contributed to its Rich
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
fiber and deserve
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
recognition I don't have to educate this
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
honorable body as to the history of
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day it has little to do with
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
the one mercenary Merchant Mariner and
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
everything to do with ending
 
05:31:31.390 --> 05:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination of it Italians after a
 
05:31:34.830 --> 05:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
brutal Massacre lynchings by the way of
 
05:31:37.390 --> 05:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
11 innocent Italian immigrants in New
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
Orleans in
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
1891 though no doubt president Harrison
 
05:31:43.708 --> 05:31:43.718 align:start position:0%
when establishing that first Columbus
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
Day celebration in
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
1892 was trying to encourage the Italian
 
05:31:50.430 --> 05:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
vote the effect of the holiday was a
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
shot in the arm to immigrants just like
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
my great-grandfather having hidden his
 
05:31:58.270 --> 05:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
given name Gano and going by Thomas to
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
try and pass as American there was
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
finally a feeling of acceptance and that
 
05:32:04.990 --> 05:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
maybe an end was in sight to blatant
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
bigotry Prejudice and
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
slurs all he wanted was to be seen as an
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
American and to raise his family as
 
05:32:14.670 --> 05:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
honorable American citizens a plasterer
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
he lived with extended family 24 of them
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
in an Italian ghetto in Harlem New York
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
sharing one toilet while doing
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
backbreaking work of constructing
 
05:32:25.548 --> 05:32:25.558 align:start position:0%
stately public buildings of New York
 
05:32:27.990 --> 05:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
City all of which stand
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
today I just thank God he is an here to
 
05:32:32.430 --> 05:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
see the statues of Columbus dozens of
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
them all over the country funded by poor
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
people like him torn to the ground
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
because of ignorance and continuing
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
anti-italian sentiment and to this I say
 
05:32:46.230 --> 05:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
vergonia which means shame in Italian a
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
sponsorship of this bill in my beloved
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
State means only one thing that
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination against Americans of
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
Italian descent is still alive and well
 
05:32:54.000 --> 05:32:54.990 align:start position:0%
Italian descent is still alive and well
in

05:32:54.990 --> 05:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:32:57.510 --> 05:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
2024 please put an end to this once and
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
for all table New Hampshire house bill
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
1335 indefinitely but I implore you do
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
more than that this year you legislated
 
05:33:08.670 --> 05:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
curricula cursive and multiplication
 
05:33:11.030 --> 05:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
tables it's sad that we need laws to
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
enforce Common Sense yet I applaud you
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
for taking necessary steps when common
 
05:33:17.948 --> 05:33:17.958 align:start position:0%
sense is nowhere to be found here's a
 
05:33:19.830 --> 05:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
perfect opportunity to legislate some
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
history and I don't mean anti-columbus
 
05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
propaganda that students are being fed
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
by uninformed teachers require that our
 
05:33:29.070 --> 05:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
public Educators not only celebrate
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day on the the second Monday of
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
October but teach children the facts of
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
origin and spend time honoring the
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
contributions of Italian immigrants in
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
building this nation in closing I ask
 
05:33:41.110 --> 05:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
you honor Italian immigrants their
 
05:33:43.070 --> 05:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
immense contributions and cultural
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%

05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
years felt they were owed a day of
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
Celebration or reparations or statues
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%

05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
exact words of Columbus in his log book
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%

knew they were a people who would be
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%

Holy Faith by love rather than by force
 
05:37:14.910 --> 05:37:14.920 align:start position:0%

up history That's
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%

vquez even by today's impossible utopian

Columbus Day as a federal Hall holid
 
05:39:03.468 --> 05:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
nearly 132 years ago Columbus was
 
05:39:05.430 --> 05:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
without doubt the greatest hero of the
 
05:39:08.350 --> 05:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
15th and 16th centuries he was a
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
capitalist in the Age of Empires and
 
05:39:13.270 --> 05:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
what he did begin the downfall
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
imperialism he was a scientist in the
 
05:39:18.430 --> 05:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
age of superstition he was civil rights
 
05:39:20.590 --> 05:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
activist in the age of Oppression and he
 
05:39:22.670 --> 05:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
was a pacifist in the age of
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
warmongering thus Columbus was an icon
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
and a paragon of model a model of exence
 
05:39:32.070 --> 05:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
in closing New Hampshire legislators
 
05:39:34.750 --> 05:39:34.760 align:start position:0%

to cancel Columbus Day and erase our

05:43:52.030 --> 05:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes only given days notice for
 
05:43:54.030 --> 05:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
people to vacate their
 
05:43:56.830 --> 05:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
houses the once cohesive Italian
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
Community was dispersed all over the Sea
 
05:44:02.350 --> 05:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
Coast homes were destroyed even though
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
there were no plans for what would
 
05:44:09.070 --> 05:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
replace them today 60 years after that
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
event there's still one lot that remains
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
vacant from urban renewal in
 
05:44:18.670 --> 05:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmith I say all this not to try to
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
equate what happened to Italian
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
immigrants through the pedon system with
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
the disgrace and horrors of slavery of
 
05:44:28.510 --> 05:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
Africans in America nor to imply that
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
other immigrants have not been treated
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
poorly but to illustrate that naming
 
05:44:36.390 --> 05:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day as a holiday was an effort
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
to help heal the racism the lynchings
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
the discrimination and other
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
mistreatment of Italian immigrants and
 
05:44:46.110 --> 05:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
their descendants have
 
05:44:49.390 --> 05:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
endured I won't go into a long testimony
 
05:44:52.510 --> 05:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
on Columbus the man suffice it to say
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that much of what is taught today and
 
05:44:58.390 --> 05:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
what you will hear and read through the
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill about columus is
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
based upon writers who had an agenda and
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
use bits and pieces of primary sources
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%

here we
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
go Columbus wasn't a saint but he was a
 
05:45:38.430 --> 05:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
good man and an Explorer and despite
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
what some people say he treated the
 
05:45:43.548 --> 05:45:43.558 align:start position:0%
native people fairly and with
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
compassion and I appreciate your
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
question representative Brown Columbus
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
never spent time in a prison he was
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
immediately released by the queen and
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
and king of Spain upon reaching
 
05:46:00.430 --> 05:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
Spain clus day holiday was declared to
 
05:46:02.190 --> 05:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
honor people who were subject to
 
05:46:04.830 --> 05:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
violence discrimination lynching slavery
 
05:46:07.150 --> 05:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
and having their lives torn apart
 
05:46:09.070 --> 05:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is a celebration of what it
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
means to be the descendant of Italian
 
05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
immigrants like most first and second
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
generation Americans of Italian descent
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of my Italian Heritage passage
 
05:46:22.750 --> 05:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
1335 would be yet another insult to the
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
150,000 New Hampshire residents of
 
05:46:32.670 --> 05:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
Italian descent and I urge you to find
 
05:46:35.628 --> 05:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
the bill in expedient to legislate thank
 
05:46:37.948 --> 05:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:09.910 align:start position:0%

05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you all for the privilege of
 
05:47:16.750 --> 05:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
testifying against hb1 335 my name is
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
Paul Monon I'm a proud citizen of New
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 50 years and I very much
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate the service that all you give
 
05:47:27.270 --> 05:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
to our
 
05:47:30.590 --> 05:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
state uh to be frank I was surprised to
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
see the subject of eliminating Columbus
 
05:47:34.948 --> 05:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
Day come up to our legislators again
 
05:47:36.670 --> 05:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
since it has been defeated in the past
 
05:47:38.310 --> 05:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge there has been no
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
new developments on this
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
subject I certainly support the
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
testimony of others that you've heard uh
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
against this discrimination proposal and
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
will not repeat their information but I
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
would like to just bring out a few other
 
05:47:53.120 --> 05:47:55.070 align:start position:0%
would like to just bring out a few other
relevant

05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
05:47:58.190 --> 05:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
additions first is a photograph which is
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
being passed
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
out it is from
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
1938 it is my grandfather an Italian
 
05:48:06.948 --> 05:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
immigrant and other Italian immigrants
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
sitting on the steps a of a church in
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
Scranton Pennsylvania where he and his
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
family lived please when you look at the
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
photograph note what these immigrants
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
are holding in their hands it is the
 
05:48:21.478 --> 05:48:24.708 align:start position:0%
are holding in their hands it is the
American

05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
flag not withstanding the current Miss
 
05:48:29.948 --> 05:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
by the way I should point out because a
 
05:48:31.468 --> 05:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
few others brought out the World War II
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
I lost two uncles in World War II not
 
05:48:36.670 --> 05:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
withstanding the current misinformation
 
05:48:39.230 --> 05:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
on the character of Christopher Columbus
 
05:48:41.430 --> 05:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
it is clear evidence that Columbus Day
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
was not a celebration of Columbus
 
05:48:46.628 --> 05:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
himself as an idol but an expression of
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh against the expression to protect
 
05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
these poor immigrants and it was an
 
05:48:52.590 --> 05:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
expression of their gratitude for being
 
05:48:55.708 --> 05:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to come to America and pursue
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
the American dream the Columbus
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
continues to be celebrated and gratitude
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
to our
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh by our immigrants for
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
being part of America and America's
 
05:49:10.030 --> 05:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
thanks to them for their contributions
 
05:49:11.310 --> 05:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
to our great
 
05:49:13.868 --> 05:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
nation as I look around this
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
room uh presumably virtually all of you
 
05:49:19.948 --> 05:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
are the descendants of immigrants from
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
some Nation Columbus Day is the only
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
holiday honoring our immigrants and I'm
 
05:49:28.110 --> 05:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
at a loss to understand the reason for
 
05:49:30.750 --> 05:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
potential eliminating it as a holiday
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
after 130 years as a national holiday
 
05:49:36.510 --> 05:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
and almost 100 years as a holiday in
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire if you could
 
05:49:41.468 --> 05:49:41.478 align:start position:0%
rationalize justifying deleting it
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
because it's named after Columbus
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps then we should eliminate the
 
05:49:48.590 --> 05:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia Columbia University
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
the Knights of Columbus Columbus Ohio
 
05:49:55.628 --> 05:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
and the 20 cities I'm sorry cities named
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
after him in 20 other states and other
 
05:49:59.548 --> 05:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
uses of his name throughout our great
 
05:50:02.110 --> 05:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
nation then we should perhaps consider
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
deleting other holidays for example
 
05:50:07.708 --> 05:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
president St presidents had slaves the
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
4th of July celebrates colonialization
 
05:50:12.868 --> 05:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
Christmas violates the separation of
 
05:50:16.110 --> 05:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
church and state so in brief out of
 
05:50:19.468 --> 05:50:19.478 align:start position:0%
respect for the best use of your time in
 
05:50:21.070 --> 05:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
service to our
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
citizens which I deeply appreciate as I
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned I suggest that you delete this
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
attack on Columbus Day once and for all
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention and
 
05:50:33.190 --> 05:50:33.200 align:start position:0%

you unfortunately we can't act beyond
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
the end of this
 
05:50:54.670 --> 05:50:54.680 align:start position:0%

uh my father Luigi garula was born

to follow the steps uh of another
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
Italian Christopher Columbus and come to
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
the New World although Christopher
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
Columbus did not discover North America
 
05:52:15.548 --> 05:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
he was uh the founder really of the
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
Western Hemisphere his exploration and
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge gained was critical in
 
05:52:24.030 --> 05:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
development of this part of the world we
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
are not here today to debate Christopher
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
Columbus we are here here today to
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
explain that millions of Italian
 
05:52:33.468 --> 05:52:33.478 align:start position:0%
Americans and other groups who
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
immigrated from far away places view
 
05:52:39.270 --> 05:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day as a day set aside to
 
05:52:42.190 --> 05:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
remember and honor those who came before
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
us and to build our country to where it
 
05:52:47.350 --> 05:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
is today they were the construction
 
05:52:49.510 --> 05:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
workers the lawyers the doctors the
 
05:52:51.990 --> 05:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
nurses the waiters the scientists the
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
teachers store owners soldiers and yes
 
05:52:59.430 --> 05:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
politicians those who said in in
 
05:53:01.708 --> 05:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
hollowed Halls of Congress and also in
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house stripping away
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is an insult to millions
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
and millions of Americans who immigrated
 
05:53:12.270 --> 05:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
here and who are a family of those who
 
05:53:14.990 --> 05:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
did my father came here because he
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
believed in the American dream my father
 
05:53:20.590 --> 05:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
lived the American dream I as a son have
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
also lived the American dream I built a
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
business from nothing and now employ
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%

05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
children and my grandchildren are living
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
the American dream my daughter Colleen
 
05:53:37.628 --> 05:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
is an army officer serving and she asked
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
me when I told her I was testifying
 
05:53:41.548 --> 05:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
today to tell her she would love to have
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
been here and to tell you how she feels
 
05:53:46.590 --> 05:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
about this part of the dream is to honor
 
05:53:48.990 --> 05:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
and cherish our history and Columbus Day
 
05:53:51.270 --> 05:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
is part of our our history I
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to find this bill
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
1335 inexpedient to legislate and let's

05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
session representative Simon thank you
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'd like to move in
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on H
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bill oh right representative Simon moves
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
in exped legis L represent Gro seconds
 
05:54:32.910 --> 05:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
um you wish to speak to your motion yes
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um been waiting
 
05:54:38.110 --> 05:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
into difficult subjects lately so I
 
05:54:41.430 --> 05:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
might as well do this one as well
 
05:54:44.030 --> 05:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I have I guess two points that I'd
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
like to make one I agree with a lot of
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony today that the present
 
05:54:50.468 --> 05:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
iteration of history on Columbus is um
 
05:54:53.070 --> 05:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate my own personal study
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
demonstrates him to be a man of Courage
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
U um a good man as a general rule um and
 
05:55:00.430 --> 05:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
was certainly exonerated from uh from
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
his crimes um but the the main portion
 
05:55:06.628 --> 05:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
main reason why I move in expedient to
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill is um what a lot
 
05:55:13.230 --> 05:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
of the testimony today kind of um spoke
 
05:55:16.350 --> 05:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
to uh which is that uh America was
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
established to be an experiment of sorts
 
05:55:20.830 --> 05:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
and and most of us are immigrants though
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
not all of us I mean there are some of
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
us who were Native um but many of us
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
were but is the one place that was
 
05:55:27.788 --> 05:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
established with the idea that um people
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
from from every nation could come and be
 
05:55:33.548 --> 05:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
free um and I feel like today uh the
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
attitude towards that is that that that
 
05:55:37.110 --> 05:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
should be somehow easy that that's
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
within the nature of human beings um to
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
do that sort of thing and it isn't in
 
05:55:44.110 --> 05:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
fact it's it's very much the opposite of
 
05:55:46.110 --> 05:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
our nature to be inclusive and to
 
05:55:48.110 --> 05:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
welcome and um to be able to work
 
05:55:49.948 --> 05:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
together through our differences and
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
establish something um that is
 
05:55:53.910 --> 05:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and Columbus Day is one of
 
05:55:55.150 --> 05:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
the days that celebrates that I would
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
also add into that Martin Luther King Jr
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
day um which allegedly um has some
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
problems in his own history but
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
symbolizes that um with uh the black
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
community and also uh with St Patrick's
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
Day uh I know people celebrate things
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
for different reasons but with the Irish
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
as well um all symbolizing our struggle
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
to integrate together and and to bring
 
05:56:17.910 --> 05:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
our different ideas and our different
 
05:56:20.468 --> 05:56:20.478 align:start position:0%
Traditions um that sometimes rub the
 
05:56:22.590 --> 05:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
wrong way uh with other people who have
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
already been established um but that we
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to come together as one
 
05:56:28.270 --> 05:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
people group and so I see see those as
 
05:56:32.110 --> 05:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a Triad of of our aspirations
 
05:56:33.990 --> 05:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um to continue to celebrate them
 
05:56:37.030 --> 05:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be to continue to Aspire um in
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
that way and so for those reasons I move
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on this bill
 
05:56:42.628 --> 05:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
and hope my colleagues will join me
 
05:56:42.638 --> 05:56:46.270 align:start position:0%
and hope my colleagues will join me
representative

05:56:46.270 --> 05:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
G thank you madam chair um this T type
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
of Bill or a bill similar of this has
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
come for before us many times and I
 
05:56:58.270 --> 05:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
think that if there had been some sort
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
of change of information or
 
05:57:05.230 --> 05:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
sentiment we might reconsider but I
 
05:57:07.390 --> 05:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
think I agree with the motion and I'm
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
sure that the house will support that as
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
well so I um that's all I have to say
 
05:57:14.110 --> 05:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
05:57:14.120 --> 05:57:15.910 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
representative

05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
Smith Madam chair um I don't go along
 
05:57:23.110 --> 05:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
with this well I do go along with the
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill I'm I I understand about the attack
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
Italians and what they have done for
 
05:57:32.270 --> 05:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
America and I agree with everything you
 
05:57:36.070 --> 05:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
said representative Simon however
 
05:57:38.590 --> 05:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't we change the name of the bill
 
05:57:41.548 --> 05:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
get Columbus out of it change the name
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill and call it an
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
Italian okay representative Grotto would
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
like to respond to that okay that's fine
 
05:57:53.548 --> 05:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
so last year on the house the floor I'm
 
05:57:53.558 --> 05:57:55.190 align:start position:0%
so last year on the house the floor I'm
I

05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:57:57.350 --> 05:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
specifically presented that floor
 
05:57:57.360 --> 05:57:59.070 align:start position:0%
specifically presented that floor
Amendment

05:57:59.070 --> 05:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:58:01.868 --> 05:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
and it was defeated by the house so the
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
house does not wish to change the name
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
of Columbus Day to Italian Heritage day
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
in that case then Okay
 
05:58:14.830 --> 05:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
g Madam chair and thank you
 
05:58:17.708 --> 05:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
representative Simon for a beautiful
 
05:58:21.868 --> 05:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
Bill though I was mistaken in my earlier
 
05:58:23.948 --> 05:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
motion on what Bill we were on my
 
05:58:28.708 --> 05:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
intention was to um to move itl on
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
13 and I am uh a proud abanaki woman my
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
first husband was Ronnie Scara from the
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
North End of Boston my daughter is
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
pursuing her Italian citizenship though
 
05:58:45.310 --> 05:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
she's already uh a citizen of the
 
05:58:48.150 --> 05:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
abanaki um the nagan band of the kosak
 
05:58:51.310 --> 05:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
abanaki nation and of course a citizen
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the United
 
05:58:56.670 --> 05:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
States I think that it is very sad that
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
this whole disc discussion has pitted a
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
or Native American people against
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
Italian people we are uh all people and
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
we have no reason to hate one another
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and we have no re reason for hard
 
05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
feelings toward one another and we have
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
lots of reasons not just how much I love
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
my ex-husband or how much I love my
 
05:59:19.030 --> 05:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
daughter but uh we have lots of reasons
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
to to not let a small faction of our
 
05:59:24.750 --> 05:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
society turn us against one another so I
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.510 --> 05:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
Madam oh thank you madam chair um most
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the testimony and what L garolo
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is really not about
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
Columbus the
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
person uh I I I appreciate all of that I
 
05:59:47.788 --> 05:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
I would like to address however because
 
05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
it was it was brought up in the initial
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
presentation of the bill a couple of
 
05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
comments that I'd like to address
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
although I have never read Washington
 
05:59:57.628 --> 05:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
Irvings biography of Christal Columbus
 
06:00:00.030 --> 06:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
has done some reading as representative
 
06:00:04.030 --> 06:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
Simon has said so I want to I want to
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
clarify what I think were several points
 
06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
made in the original
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
presentation um when Columbus did come
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the New World there was a huge uh
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
decrease in the population not because
 
06:00:19.040 --> 06:00:20.270 align:start position:0%
decrease in the population not because
Columbus

06:00:20.270 --> 06:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
Columbus
 
06:00:23.350 --> 06:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
and uh others went out and slaughtered
 
06:00:25.990 --> 06:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
everyone it was because mainly because
 
06:00:28.190 --> 06:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
disease that was brought to this this
 
06:00:31.310 --> 06:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
part of the of the World by the
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
Europeans and and there was a a also an
 
06:00:37.990 --> 06:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
issue where Columbus was defending some
 
06:00:40.430 --> 06:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the tribes that were being subjected
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
to cannibalism by other
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
tribes that's one of them so there was a
 
06:00:47.868 --> 06:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
reduction of population but an inference
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that Columbus uh eliminated all
 
06:00:53.548 --> 06:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
those people I think in my estimation it
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
is accurate R talked about the prison uh
 
06:00:58.990 --> 06:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
the prison sentence and the
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
exoneration um also certainly we know
 
06:01:04.990 --> 06:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
now that there were others that had
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
discovered uh this continent but at that
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
time and and celebrating the fact that
 
06:01:13.830 --> 06:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
Columbus was a brave person and
 
06:01:15.548 --> 06:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
discovered a continent that no one knew
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
was here at the time was very accurate
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
the Europeans at that
 
06:01:22.990 --> 06:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
time did not know that there was a
 
06:01:26.468 --> 06:01:26.478 align:start position:0%
continent here so to say that it
 
06:01:28.030 --> 06:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
everyone kind of kind of knew this
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
already and Columbus was not a brave
 
06:01:33.150 --> 06:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
Mariner for that I think is inaccurate
 
06:01:33.160 --> 06:01:33.910 align:start position:0%
Mariner for that I think is inaccurate
as

06:01:33.910 --> 06:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:01:33.920 --> 06:01:38.310 align:start position:0%
as
well

06:01:38.310 --> 06:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:40.750 --> 06:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think I think that's all I had
 
06:01:42.270 --> 06:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
the other pieces of been touched on so
 
06:01:45.468 --> 06:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay all right I
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make two
 
06:01:51.468 --> 06:01:51.478 align:start position:0%
points and the first is that we keep
 
06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
tearing down our heroes because they
 
06:01:54.280 --> 06:01:55.628 align:start position:0%
tearing down our heroes because they
aren't

06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
perfect and that's something that it's
 
06:02:01.468 --> 06:02:01.478 align:start position:0%
it's our fault for expecting the people
 
06:02:04.350 --> 06:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
who accomplish things to be perfect if
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're human they're not going to be
 
06:02:09.628 --> 06:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
perfect and the other thing is that
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact that other people
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
had visited this continent from the
 
06:02:18.468 --> 06:02:18.478 align:start position:0%
Vikings to St Columban was it St Brandon
 
06:02:20.910 --> 06:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
St brandan I
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
think it was Columbus and his
 
06:02:27.510 --> 06:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
voyages that started the integration of
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
the Western Hemisphere with the Eastern
 
06:02:31.270 --> 06:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hemisphere and that changed the whole
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
world forever and I think we need to
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that regardless of any issues
 
06:02:40.230 --> 06:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
of the person or people
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
involved um so I am definitely going to
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else all right we've all
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
speeed by um the motion is in expedient
 
06:02:55.070 --> 06:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
to legislate by representative Simon and
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%

of itl passes 14 to one is there any
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
consent representative Schmidt objects
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
to consent so we'll put this on the
 
06:03:43.558 --> 06:03:45.150 align:start position:0%
to consent so we'll put this on the
regular

06:03:45.150 --> 06:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
regular
 
06:03:48.430 --> 06:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
calendar I wish to speak to my objection
 
06:03:52.070 --> 06:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
to consent this is
 
06:03:56.350 --> 06:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is a perennial bill which has
 
06:03:58.830 --> 06:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
the very
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate effect of being seen as
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
anti-italian it's clearly anti-columbus
 
06:04:11.310 --> 06:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh for reasons which we can uh argue and
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
dispute U with regard to every aspect of
 
06:04:16.590 --> 06:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
his character his accomplishments and so
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
forth um it certainly is an
 
06:04:18.958 --> 06:04:20.230 align:start position:0%
forth um it certainly is an
anti-columbus

06:04:20.230 --> 06:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
anti-columbus
 
06:04:22.590 --> 06:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
Bill and but it is
 
06:04:26.310 --> 06:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
inextricably seen by Italian Americans
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
as an anti Italian American Bill
 
06:04:31.670 --> 06:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
denigrating their Great accomplishments
 
06:04:35.230 --> 06:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
and contri contributions to this country
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
that is extremely unfortunate because uh
 
06:04:43.230 --> 06:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that none of us uh think that
 
06:04:46.350 --> 06:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
there's any Merit whatsoever in the idea
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
of Italian Americans not having made
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
magnificent contributions not only to
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
World culture but to this country across
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
the board if if
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
if I if I had to measure how much
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
spaghetti I've eaten I'm certainly more
 
06:05:05.948 --> 06:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
than 100% Italian just in the last year
 
06:05:09.468 --> 06:05:09.478 align:start position:0%
but in any case uh the reality is that
 
06:05:11.430 --> 06:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill and that's one of the
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
reasons that it should be on the regular
 
06:05:15.670 --> 06:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
calendar that the whole house should be
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to vote no on the
 
06:05:22.468 --> 06:05:22.478 align:start position:0%
idea of um of that that this house is in
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
any way a party to the idea that
 
06:05:28.468 --> 06:05:28.478 align:start position:0%
italian-americans have not made enormous
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
contributions on the one hand but also
 
06:05:33.750 --> 06:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
suffered greatly as has virtually every
 
06:05:39.030 --> 06:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
other non uh non indigenous population
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
and they have their own suffering to to
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh be uh to be cognizant of so I think
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
the whole house should vote no on
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
this thank you that's easy enough all
 
06:05:55.788 --> 06:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
right I think we finished our executive
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
session and we are done for the day and
 
06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
I will see you all tomorrow in session
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:26.000 --> 06:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
vacation
