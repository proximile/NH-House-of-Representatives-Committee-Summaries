to me

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
phrase about
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
the final four being the end of march
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
madness but
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
as it turned out we had five things so
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative rogers for
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
catching that and letting me know
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh so uh as a result of that we
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
definitely will be talking about
 
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
hb1 around family planning today
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and then we have a pretty significant
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
i imagine kind of a long conversation on
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
the sununu
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
center and um i
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
uh that mr ripple sent out an email that
 
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh that mr ripple sent out an email that
had

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think nine attachments to it and plus
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
encourage you to take a look at uh this
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
maura o'neal's email that
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a report in it that i sent
 
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.310 align:start position:0%
with a report in it that i sent
separately

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think we need to be familiar with all
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
of those so that we can discuss them
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
well this afternoon and make some
 
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.070 align:start position:0%
well this afternoon and make some
decisions

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
i want to lock down where we stand on
 
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
i want to lock down where we stand on
sysc

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i would ask representative weiler
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
and representative waller
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
since you have so much experience in
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
this area
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would uh be willing at that
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
point to turn the chair
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
over to you representative weiler to let
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
you lead that part of the discussion
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that you're nodding your head i think
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's okay right
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay so so we'll talk about that
 
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
yes okay so so we'll talk about that
last

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
because that's such a significant piece
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh then we have uh two back of the
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
budget votes
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh we reviewed them yesterday so
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're ready to vote on them
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
today i think we are
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then we voted on out in hb2
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
related to the adt transfers
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the community to coordinate care but
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
as we went to hb1 representative
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
walner pointed out that to see the whole
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget before we vote on that separate
 
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.909 align:start position:0%
budget before we vote on that separate
item

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
so at this point hopefully we're up to
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
speed and we can
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
look at the hp1 impact and make a
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
decision on that
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh and then dhhs requested some budget
 
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.670 align:start position:0%
uh and then dhhs requested some budget
line

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
changes that went out uh i apologize
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
because i think i've uh accidentally sat
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
on that issue
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
since about nine or ten days ago when uh
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
department sent it to us um and as
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
i look at it and i've talked a little
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
bit to mr ripple and gotten some
 
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.110 align:start position:0%
bit to mr ripple and gotten some
secondary

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
impact from ms rounds uh it it seems
 
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
impact from ms rounds uh it it seems
like

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
one through 19 are probably not
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
particularly controversial they tend to
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
um weigh each other out net each other
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
out item 20
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
is pretty significant but we were
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
briefed on it
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
when we heard the new hampshire
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh presentation
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's one particular slide mr ripple
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
when we get to that will you be able to
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
show that one slide were you able to
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
find it in the new hampshire hospital
 
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
find it in the new hampshire hospital
presentation

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't have enough but i can find it
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
now yeah we won't be talking about
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
any of these i don't well maybe we could
 
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.909 align:start position:0%
any of these i don't well maybe we could
okay

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
so so those are the five items for today
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think that if we do those five
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
we've done everything and we're done
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh except for doing our finance
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee work
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
next week and so this is really getting
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
to be the last
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
call uh if if if you think we're missing
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
something if you want another discussion
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
on something
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
please let me know because this is
 
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.469 align:start position:0%
please let me know because this is
really

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know the very last minute as they
 
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
you know the very last minute as they
say

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
so so um mr ripple i do have a question
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
um on once we go through these
 
00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
um on once we go through these
conversations

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to generate
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
a an update to that
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
two those two summary documents you did
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the two i believe the
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
one with the line item details
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
showing changes from hp one and two
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then the other one that just
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
summarizes the general
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
impact of the of them both do
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
do we do you need to produce those and
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
have a vote on those
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
also or if we just decide these
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
incremental things are we good
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
sorry the incremental votes are enough
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
you don't need to vote on the summary
 
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.790 align:start position:0%
you don't need to vote on the summary
documents

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you are interested in those documents
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
now i do have updated versions
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
reflecting what you did yesterday
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
well why don't you hang on to them
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
because i think we're going to have to
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
update them again based on today and so
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't see a need to you know
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
move copies around that are
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
going to be out of date so shortly
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
um representative weiler your hand is up
 
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
um representative weiler your hand is up
sir

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes i get some updated uh revenue from
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh from uh chris in the
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
lba and he says that this is
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is an amendment to hb1 it's
 
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
this is an amendment to hb1 it's
official

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
i said what about the fact we have this
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
official thing and he said well
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
according to his reading get anything
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
official from
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
from ways and means whether it's
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the house or not
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
the uh he thinks that the rules allow us
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
to update things
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
as we get them but this is kind of late
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
late in the system it's like almost 90
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
million in the first year and 74 million
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
in the second year
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh so you know i think those
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
those are better done in the senate if
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we could
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's things we really want to
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize i think we could add some
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
things back in but
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
this is kind of late in the game this
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
these would take a couple of days to go
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
through all this stuff
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to meet at noon with the
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
speaker and see what he thinks but
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
to me this is kind of late in the game
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes sir could you clarify
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
if those additions are off of the
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
existing ways and means estimate
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
or off of the estimates the governor
 
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.230 align:start position:0%
or off of the estimates the governor
used

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh these are off of the existing ways
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
and means
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
so that you know they're not off the
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
governor so obviously they're they're
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
the additions
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the green sheet so
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we just accepted them and mr ripple
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
rolled them
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
into our summary documents
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that just show um
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what we call that the
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
difference between revenues and expenses
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that just show a higher
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
margin yeah i guess it would show a
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
greater margin we could say yeah
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
recommend it to go to the
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund for all of that
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we've done that we pared down
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
what we think is important and not in
 
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
what we think is important and not in
the

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services which was our
 
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.710 align:start position:0%
health and human services which was our
task

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
task
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then at the last minute with with
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
more revenue
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a fair game yes sir i
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
i agree that i don't think we should be
 
00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
i agree that i don't think we should be
chasing

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
chasing
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to spend it at this
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
point because we're wrapping up but
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
miss mister uh we'll come i'll come to
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
you in just a second representative
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
i want to see what mr ripple had to say
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say that that's not
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
anything you need to do in division
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
three that's more of a full committee
 
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
three that's more of a full committee
thing

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
ah brilliant
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's the insight we
 
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's the insight we
hope

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
hope
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
for um all right representative wallner
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
question ma'am yes um
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler yesterday i
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
thought what you referred to or
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yesterday i guess it was 127
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
now it's 164 million dollars over
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
the ways and means estimates
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way it adds up the
 
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way it adds up the
table

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
that chris chase sent me to to accept
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
he headed in a in a rather unusual form
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
he should
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
compared with what we got on the green
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
sheet it shows total general fund
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then it shows education fund and i
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
wrote back to him and said why are the
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
numbers so different he said well you
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
failed to add
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund but he's got
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 in fiscal year 23 and
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
two columns and the columns below that
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
he's got fiscal year 2018 in fiscal year
 
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.389 align:start position:0%
he's got fiscal year 2018 in fiscal year
2019

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
so how was i to know that i'm supposed
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
to add those
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
figures with the education trust fund
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
into the ones above
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get the real total which i did
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it's and the figures have changed a
 
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.150 align:start position:0%
so it's and the figures have changed a
bit

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
from what we discussed so now it's it's
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
like 163.9 or 164 million which is more
 
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.829 align:start position:0%
like 163.9 or 164 million which is more
than

00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
the original thing it would still be
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
roughly about 50 of
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
so it'd be about 90 above the uh
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
163 yeah so anyway that's
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be more than what
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
what the governor's was
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
since this issue is a great issue but
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the scope of division
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the scope of division
three

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
right can we wrap this up representative
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to stop you from talking
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
more though
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
well i i just wondered if uh
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
if i could get that um
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that in a corrective form
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
okay from chris to everybody okay
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you i would i would love to
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
see that okay thank you
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh let's go to the oldest first on this
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
miss ripple
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh let's go to that 200k add to hp1
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'm taking you out of your anticipated
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
sequence i bet
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna free shut my door and tell the
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you guys can hear that
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
or not but that dog
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
has a really high pitched bark pierces
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay so um you may recall this
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
was originally in one of the house bills
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we voted on
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh your your hand is up represent walnut
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a question or is that
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
no it's lord thank you so
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
so this was a house bill 2 item that
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
simply showed a 200
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
000 um reservation of funds to
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
support the admissions dispositions and
 
00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:41.829 align:start position:0%
support the admissions dispositions and
transfers

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
transactions that help coordinate
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
community care
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
as our clients around the state
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh and because that was for ongoing
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
operations and
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
sort of came a little late uh in the in
 
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.150 align:start position:0%
sort of came a little late uh in the in
the

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
governor's budget process it got put
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
into hb1
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
so because that is an ongoing expense
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
we voted to take it out of hp2 and put
 
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.269 align:start position:0%
we voted to take it out of hp2 and put
it

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
back into hb1 and as we do that
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
hb1 reflects
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
the 600 000 match that goes along with
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
that 200
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
000 and then in the process of
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
looking into this um uh one
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
one of our state employees noticed that
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was an eight hundred and four
 
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.310 align:start position:0%
there was an eight hundred and four
dollar

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
um typo uh and so she's using this
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clean up
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
the typo and get the document more
 
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
the typo and get the document more
precise

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
precise
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
so so the effect on this is that we
 
00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:49.829 align:start position:0%
so so the effect on this is that we
would

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
add the 200 000 to the general funds
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
because it's an operating expense
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
we'd add the 600 000 to the federal
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
total because we'd be eligible for a
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
three to one match apparently and that
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
would add 800
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
000 overall as an increase
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
without really looking at the 804
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
typo so that's
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing is there is
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's representative irfan we had talked
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
briefly about this i can't see if he's
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here yet you have any any thoughts
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
on this sir
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think we should do it
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
so um i gotta fix
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
my zoom box so i can see everyone give
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
me a second i'm distracted
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is we agreed that
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
the funding the the
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
what we were spending the money on was
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
worthwhile the
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
the adt system as you described it hello
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
could you could you mute yeah there you
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
go so representative walner
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
um you i think you wanted more time just
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
because it was the right thing to do
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
not that you had an issue with this but
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
but i don't know
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
no issue i'm fine okay
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
all right so do you need a vote on this
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
or yes i think voting on this would be
 
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.630 align:start position:0%
or yes i think voting on this would be
good

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
is there an amendment number there's no
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment number since it's only a
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
change to the numbers in house bill 1.
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
you could just take a motion to vote on
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
the recommended changes to account 59-52
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
removed second
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
being moved and seconded is there any
 
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.230 align:start position:0%
being moved and seconded is there any
discussion

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing any discussion uh would the
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
clerk take a role please
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%

believe representative
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
irf and rogers have gotten together
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
twice to bounce things around and
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%

um has money that's in excess of the
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
match but has money
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
that would fill the gap for the clinics
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
will not be receiving um federal monies
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
until the um
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
the federal gap the federal
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
gag order is lifted and it will take
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
approximately nine months for that money
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
to come through
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that i have would um
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
help fill that gap
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
with general funds um until the
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year so that they would
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
get do that have
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
words around that is that an hb2 is that
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
a footnote is that something
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment house bill one it's
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
the one that yesterday i had offered i
 
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
the one that yesterday i had offered i
believe

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
represent representative ripple has that
 
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.070 align:start position:0%
represent representative ripple has that
available

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
um since it's the same one we had
 
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.230 align:start position:0%
um since it's the same one we had
yesterday

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay so what you want to do
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
will you want to discuss the wording of
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
the footnote or will you want to discuss
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the accounts it's not a footnote it's
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
to the house bill one and it simply
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
changes the um
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
okay so so mr ripple if we could start
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
with uh hb1 that you put together for me
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
so let's just scroll down to the general
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
funds line
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
okay and talk about this um so mr ripple
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
as i'm seeing the 811
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
805 in the in the first cell of the
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
is that is that precisely the amount
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
that was in the governor's budget
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
because i i i'm remembering eight twelve
 
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.470 align:start position:0%
because i i i'm remembering eight twelve
thousand

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
so i think this is the exact number
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's the precise number okay
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's all right i i had it in my head
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
as a rounding thing um okay so
 
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.149 align:start position:0%
as a rounding thing um okay so
um

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
so two years ago the in the fy 1819
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
budget the general funds
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh funded family lines
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
at about 596 000 a year
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
596. and then the trump administration
 
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
596. and then the trump administration
happened

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
and there were you know moves and
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
counter moves
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
during uh his administration on
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
on acceptance and movement of federal
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
money and
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
supplementing and backfilling okay so
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's behind us
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
um so so what this proposal
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
does is it says family planning is
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
important to the state
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
we want to go from 596 000 that was
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
being spent
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
in fy 19
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
we want to accept the governor's budget
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
at 812
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
or 811 805 to be more precise
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
that was the governor's recommendation
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
on top of that because we voted on hb2
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday to uh require the physical
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
and financial separation
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
of family planning counseling from
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
other medical procedures
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have we can anticipate the
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
probability or possibility
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to have to go
 
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to have to go
get

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
new vendors so that there isn't
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
a gap in access to care
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
and because we want to encourage new
 
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
and because we want to encourage new
vendors

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
new competition um
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm proposing that we add 50 000
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
in general funds and the purpose of
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
those general funds is written in that
 
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
those general funds is written in that
footnote

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
footnote
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
of the amount appropriated in this class
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
50 000 shall be used for the purpose of
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
providing incentive fees to first-time
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
contract awardees
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 100 000 or excuse me 10
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
000 per awardee
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
and also that those none of these funds
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
shall lapse within the biennium but will
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
lapse at the end of the biennium
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
so so this gives new
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
vendors a financial incentive
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
to bid on these family planning
 
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.149 align:start position:0%
to bid on these family planning
contracts

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
so that we don't end up having
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
one entity exit the market without a
 
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
one entity exit the market without a
replacement

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
to to maintain a uh continuity of
 
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
to to maintain a uh continuity of
operations

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that's what that 50 000 does
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
and it's basically says hey if you've
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
never received a family
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
planning contract and you're interested
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
in a bidding if you get the bid
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you a ten thousand
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
dollar bonus for uh participating
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
you could rationalize that a little bit
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
further that just to think that they may
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
have some startup costs that it could
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
help them with um so so
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
i would uh have us increase the general
 
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
i would uh have us increase the general
fund

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
fund
from

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommendation to 861
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
0805 an addition of 50 000
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
with the note that that that 861
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
is considerably more than it was in fy
 
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.110 align:start position:0%
is considerably more than it was in fy
19

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
19
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
when it was in the 596 category
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
so um with with that i'm i'm happy to
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
answer any of your questions of what
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
this hb1 is trying to do
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
and uh representative rogers
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
um yes i mean i i'm alarmed that you
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
want to drive people out of business
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
which you've tried to do with the first
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
gag order that you have in house bill 2.
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
not a gag order
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
there is no gag order please don't say
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
that there is no gag order
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say it because there is we
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
have a difference of opinion
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i can state my opinion right just
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
categorically you're wrong but go ahead
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
categorically i'm not but we have a
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
we removed the gag order we removed the
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
gag order from the leon amendment
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
and it is not what we passed yesterday
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
there is no gag order
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
please do not mislead the public you can
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
live in your fantasy and you can mislead
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
the public but what you're trying to do
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
is all right i'm willing to take a
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
to approve this uh part of the budget so

go over the schedule for the the day i
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
thought originally we were
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
gonna meet at 9 30 we were then gonna
 
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
gonna meet at 9 30 we were then gonna
recess

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
until two and i i just wanted a
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
clarification of
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
what your plan is for the day i i think
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to um that that was an
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
initial concept but since we have a
 
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.630 align:start position:0%
initial concept but since we have a
quorum

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
and some of these are uh things that
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've talked about and looked at
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and probably are ready to vote um
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm voting on them would you prefer
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
to have the back of the budget vote this
 
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:32.070 align:start position:0%
to have the back of the budget vote this
afternoon

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
um i i think whatever your plan is
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to finish today so
 
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to finish today so
yeah

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i think i think we've had an
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to look at these
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
and um let's uh let's get into the
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
conversation part
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative rogers your hand is up
 
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.029 align:start position:0%
representative rogers your hand is up
yes

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
are you going to um continue in the vein
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you disagree
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
anyone disagrees with you you're going
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
to cut off discussion
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
i i think it's fair to say that i've
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
never done that except
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance where um i
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
just think it's a factual
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
matter that you are misstating
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
what we voted on yesterday there was no
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
gag order we intentionally passed an
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that removed it
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to use this form
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
to misinform the public if you would
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
like to misinform the public
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to do that outside of
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
so if you disagree with one of us you're
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to cut off the discussion
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
if you're misrepresenting obvious facts
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if you're misleading
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
the public intentionally yes and that's
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
my judgment if we have a disagreement on
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
facts in any item you will cut off this
 
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.350 align:start position:0%
facts in any item you will cut off this
discussion

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
i i would reserve the right to but
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
you'll you've worked with me for over a
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
month and you know that's not my style
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
my style is to encourage
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
the conversation and to support and
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
facilitate the exchange of opinions that
 
00:29:58.799 --> 00:29:59.029 align:start position:0%
facilitate the exchange of opinions that
are

00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
contrary to my own but i will not
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
allow an overt misrepresentation of
 
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
allow an overt misrepresentation of
facts

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
be issued from uh one of these meetings
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
and if you want to misrepresent facts
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to do that
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
outside in my opinion i am not
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting the facts i'm clearly
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
stating them
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and you are missing so i made a decision
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that we're moving on
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
so you are going to cut me off whenever
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
i disagree with you thank you for
 
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.870 align:start position:0%
i disagree with you thank you for
clarifying

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think my point is clear and it's not
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said but
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
if that's the effect you want to take
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
from it you're welcome to
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
are we ready to talk about the back of
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
the budget yes ma'am
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're in the conversation mode
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
what would you like to say
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
anything well i'm looking at the um the
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
one that's up on the screen right now i
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean there are i guess there are going
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
two back of the budget amendments and
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the one that
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
um is a reduction of the workforce
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
for health and human services of 226
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
they have just come through a pandemic
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they have worked so hard over there
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
to get new hampshire keep new hampshire
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
healthy and
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
to try to get us through what was a
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
terrible situation
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
for our state and for for the nation and
 
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:33.350 align:start position:0%
for our state and for for the nation and
we've

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
um trying to get people vaccinated and
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
keep people from getting coronavirus
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
um and it's been a really hard year for
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
them and i know that
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
their vacancy rate has been high because
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that people had to stay home
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
with their families
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
and some people probably took early
 
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.310 align:start position:0%
and some people probably took early
retirement

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about their own health and i
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
think this is i think this
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
is a really important i think this is a
 
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
is a really important i think this is a
really

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
very devastating uh reduction of staff
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
remembering that karen rounds came to us
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
and did suggest a hundred
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
positions i thought that was
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
i thought that was very brave of her to
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
do that and
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
um i really thought she was trying to
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
come to us with a good
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
with a good solution um to help
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
people move forward but now you've more
 
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:37.909 align:start position:0%
people move forward but now you've more
than

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
doubled her suggestion and
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
i just think this is going to be very
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for the department as they try
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
to rebuild
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
and that's what they need to do in the
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
next the next two years is rebuild that
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
um that department so i'm going to be
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
voting no
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
on this amendment and
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
hope that all of you will join me yes
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
ma'am i
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify uh one thing i
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if ms rounds is on the line maybe
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
you want to bring her
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
in mr ripple okay and
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
and the thing i want to clarify is i
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
ms rounds it came to us with the hundred
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
at at my request and that she was
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
helping me um
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
in my request for 100 to figure out what
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
the financial impact was
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
so because i didn't know the average per
 
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
so because i didn't know the average per
person

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
cost associated with that so i i don't i
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
don't want it left that she recommended
 
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:39.110 align:start position:0%
don't want it left that she recommended
100

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
cut because i i i don't know that that
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
would be accurate
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
miss rounds do you have a comment on
 
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.710 align:start position:0%
miss rounds do you have a comment on
that

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
good morning um i think that's correct i
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you fully fund all
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
of our positions because
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
going into our budget we have uh 88
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
positions that are currently unfunded
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposed budget so um
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's wrong to say that
 
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's wrong to say that
if

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
if i was going to offer anything
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
the most i could ever suggest would be
 
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.190 align:start position:0%
the most i could ever suggest would be
100

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
and even that is going to be painful and
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
create problems in the department
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
because what i'm really looking at is
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
180 positions
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
from um from our authorized number
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
so to think that it's going to be
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
226 plus 88 it's almost 300 positions
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
that will be unfunded
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the house budget is very difficult to
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you representative
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
did you i just wanted to make sure that
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
ms round's comments were on the record
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
accurately so
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
do you have any anything to say in
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
response to that
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
no i but i just thought that miss rounds
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
very very generous when she came forward
 
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:03.910 align:start position:0%
very very generous when she came forward
with

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
that information about the hundred
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
positions and
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
um a very difficult thing for an
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
employee to do
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i appreciated her doing it and um
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
i think this when you realize that there
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
were already 88 positions and now
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
well over 300 positions um
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is really leaving the
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
department in a very a very difficult
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
place and representative oh i'm sorry
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
no that's all i have to say i just think
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
position to put them in
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler do you have a
 
00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler do you have a
comment

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
question yes i think you missed
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
characterizing the set
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
act as if we're rebuilding a destroyed
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
agency this
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
agency had been given a task that was
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
monumental and growing
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
and it was something they were unable to
 
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
and it was something they were unable to
achieve

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
so this is basically removing many of
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
the vacancies and still leaving them
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
vacancies they can
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
fill so these this takes some heat off
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
them trying to fill and
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
create different departments that you
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
know we're in a
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
program that they're unable to fill
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're unable to find the places for
 
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
they're unable to find the places for
them

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
so this has taken there's no sense
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
in throwing money that cannot be spent
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
and if we don't even have these people
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
to put on the budget
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
then why would we put money in so what
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing is cleaning up to reality
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair i
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
i have trouble comprehending what
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative weiler just said but
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
um could you uh explain i i don't
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
remember the number of 3 000.
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
can you maybe give us a little
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
background on how that number was
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
arrived at
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
the 3 000 full-time
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
authorized positions okay i
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i can uh to a bit
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
so on the 11th of march
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh or as of the 11th of march i received
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
a vacancy report
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
from the department and
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
based on that vacancy report
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
they had 507 positions
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
vacant they were at
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
2 646 positions
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
filled in the governor's budget
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
i believe they were authorized three
 
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
i believe they were authorized three
thousand

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
two hundred and twenty six positions
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
the 226 cut
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
is to an extent just a little bit
 
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.790 align:start position:0%
is to an extent just a little bit
arbitrary

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
but it takes them from the governor's
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
three two two six
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
to three thousand that three thousand
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
because of the vacancy rates as of the
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
represents an additional hiring
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the department
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
of about 350 people
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
that 350 people
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
from a 2600 base
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
represents nearly a 14
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
increase in personnel above what they
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
had on hand
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
on the 14th of march or excuse me the
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
11th of march
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so given the repeated
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
remarks about there being a workforce
 
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
remarks about there being a workforce
shortage

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
and um it
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to me to be
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't seem to me to be a hard
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
management task
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
to grow their personnel by 14
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
above what they have today we're giving
 
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
above what they have today we're giving
them

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
more people to do the job now
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
it isn't as many people as they
 
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
it isn't as many people as they
requested

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
but to the request that we received
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday to make sure that we were
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
giving them
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
guidance i think our guidance in this
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're still letting you grow
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
substantially 14 above what you have on
 
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.790 align:start position:0%
substantially 14 above what you have on
hand

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
350 positions but please
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
prioritize direct health care
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
because we try to protect those funds
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
and please
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
prioritize those requirements that you
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
have statutory
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
direction to implement and as we look
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
through the budget book and we looked at
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations and federal laws
 
00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations and federal laws
and

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
state laws there's a whole bunch of
 
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
state laws there's a whole bunch of
legal

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
requirements that the department has so
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
so this would kick it back
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
to their management team their
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
leadership team
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
to manage the growth because it's growth
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
and what they have to manage their 14
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
growth to emphasize
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
the direct support of our new hampshire
 
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.309 align:start position:0%
the direct support of our new hampshire
patients

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
enhance their ability to execute the
 
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.470 align:start position:0%
enhance their ability to execute the
laws

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they're obligated to follow so
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's the background
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
of the 226 number it was a it was a
 
00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
of the 226 number it was a it was a
number

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
that got us to 3 000 which is an easy
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
number to understand
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
so um yes ma'am follow follow-up
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you um i guess i would take
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue or stress some concern
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
that um part of the the problem is the
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
fact that they
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
um have had trouble fighting
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half have been
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
an exceptional time in the country
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the issues that's
 
00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the issues that's
developed

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
is the whole issue of hiring and keeping
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
everything functioning properly so i i
 
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.390 align:start position:0%
everything functioning properly so i i
think

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
for us to look back at this year
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
probably isn't a very reliable base to
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
as far as their ability to hire so i
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
would just make that comment thank you
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and just as another data point
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
um the the department was authorized
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of fy 19 2916 people
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and so this budget would authorize 3 000
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's still an additional 84 people
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
above what they were authorized two
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
so so there is some rooms there is some
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
breathing room
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
for an effective management team to make
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
some priorities
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
and to create a plan i believe i trust
 
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.309 align:start position:0%
and to create a plan i believe i trust
them

00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative wallner your hand is up
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
so the one thing i really dislike about
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
back of the budget
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
reductions and i have to say that you
 
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.829 align:start position:0%
reductions and i have to say that you
know

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
they happen they've happened in many
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
it means that you haven't really the
 
00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
it means that you haven't really the
legislature

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't really come to grips with what it
 
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
hasn't really come to grips with what it
is

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
we think we don't want the department to
 
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.870 align:start position:0%
we think we don't want the department to
do

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um i think that's unfair to the
 
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.790 align:start position:0%
and um i think that's unfair to the
department

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
and unfair really it really it
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
means that we are not doing what we were
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
sent here to do
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
if there are things that we think the
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
department doesn't need to be doing
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
then i think we should we should have
 
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.470 align:start position:0%
then i think we should we should have
the

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to tell them that and if we
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
had gone through the budget
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
in a more methodical way
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
and looked at each department
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
in each division more carefully
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
and heard about what it means to reduce
 
00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:06.390 align:start position:0%
and heard about what it means to reduce
staff

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
what it means to reduce spending in
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
then i think we would have been able to
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
point to those areas that we think that
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
the department does not need to be doing
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so i think it this is just um
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
us not really meeting our our
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
us not really meeting our our
responsibilities

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i i can understand that
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
perspective and from my perspective
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
we uh we went through every
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh au we looked at every line
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
in the financial statement um
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
every member of the committee had
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask questions and to
 
00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask questions and to
probe

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
probe
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
and um and and that opportunity to ask
 
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.109 align:start position:0%
and um and and that opportunity to ask
questions

00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
was taken advantage of many times
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
about a week ago or so we
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
went through an ad back process
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and everyone on the committee was
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
encouraged to participate
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
in advancing ad backs and
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
every member that brought forward a
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation or an idea
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to explain it and to
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
make a case for the rest of the
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
committee to support it
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
in hindsight we may not have used the
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
three and a half weeks as well as you
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
would like
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
i would nevertheless say that every
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
individual was
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
allowed an opportunity to make the most
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
out of the three weeks there was nothing
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we didn't give people an
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
so um so that that would be my
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
perspective on that
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
and your hand is still up i don't know
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to move uh amendment number
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
your second second being moved and
 
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:20.790 align:start position:0%
your second second being moved and
seconded

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
seconded
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you take a role in favor
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um so then let's move to
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget cut the money can
 
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget cut the money can
you

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.839 --> 00:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
all right so this was distributed
 
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
all right so this was distributed
yesterday

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
um so people could think about it
 
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.750 align:start position:0%
um so people could think about it
overnight

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
oh why is there 30 million in the first
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
year and
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
and 20 million in the second year that
 
00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:46.470 align:start position:0%
and 20 million in the second year that
was

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
a distribution that i asked mr ripple to
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
and what i thought would be big drivers
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
of those reductions
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be the management of the higher
 
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
would be the management of the higher
lag

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
lag
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be a big contributor in other
 
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
would be a big contributor in other
words

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
given that the department still has an
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh add
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
14 more people than they had on staff on
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
the 11th of march
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
then the timing of those hires
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
could contribute personnel savings that
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
would show up in
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
these dollars so that that's that's a
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
key part of the theory
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
um are there are there any questions or
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
comments about this
 
00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:39.270 align:start position:0%
comments about this
representative

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
basically the same comments i had on on
 
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:42.630 align:start position:0%
basically the same comments i had on on
the

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
um reduction of the uh
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
staffing i mean we went through the
 
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.510 align:start position:0%
staffing i mean we went through the
budget

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
we've not given them any direction as to
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
whether where we think
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing things that we don't think
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
they should be doing
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
um and how they would cut basically 50
 
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
um and how they would cut basically 50
million

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
plus stand to lose
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
a large amount of federal money maybe as
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
much as another 50 million
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that's i don't think
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's wise budgeting at all
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
um and um i think that you know we're
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
just giving up the legislature's
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.750 align:start position:0%
just giving up the legislature's
authority

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
to make some of these decisions i mean
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
we leave everything to the executive
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
branch and um after a while
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature will just okay whatever
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
decides to do and i think that leaving
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
these decisions up to them without us
 
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
these decisions up to them without us
taking

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you again i can understand that
 
00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.109 align:start position:0%
thank you again i can understand that
perspective

00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
another perspective on this is that
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature isn't just accepting
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
what the executive branch gave us
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the governor's budget we're making
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
a significant change
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's still above what we did in fy 21
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
but it's less than what the governor
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
would project
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
would have had us do so we certainly
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't haven't given up our legislative
 
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.230 align:start position:0%
don't haven't given up our legislative
prerogative

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
prerogative
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
there were a couple hb2 items in there
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
one we struck the 1.5 million
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
to do safety infrastructure and senior
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
citizen centers because we didn't think
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't an effective program so
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
that was us saying
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
no let's not do that then um
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
we changed we made some other changes in
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 that are different than what the
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
governor wanted
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
for example we changed that lap state
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
so so i don't i i don't think we've
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
given up
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
our prerogative and i i would say that
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
we have given
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
the department guidance
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
because you know half of this hb2 is
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated to saying
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
no reductions shall be made to
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriations in the following area
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
developmental services including
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder services
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
and children's in-home support services
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
the children's health insurance program
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
or county programs including the state's
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
share of funding for nursing
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
facilities and other long-term care
 
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.910 align:start position:0%
facilities and other long-term care
services

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
so so those items represent
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
the general direction that we support
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
investments in direct health care
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
to put hands on the citizens and
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
patients in new hampshire that need
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
given that they operate in a heavily
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislated and regulated environment
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
between the federal government and the
 
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.150 align:start position:0%
between the federal government and the
state

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
government they are not suffering from a
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
lack of guidance
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
they have guidance more than they care
 
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.109 align:start position:0%
they have guidance more than they care
to

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sure so so i just
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't accept fully although i understand
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from i don't accept
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
fully the idea that we haven't provided
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
enough guidance
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
so are there are there any other
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
so i entertain a motion to adopt zero
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
nine four six
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'd move adopt amendment zero nine four
 
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.870 align:start position:0%
i'd move adopt amendment zero nine four
six

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded um mr clerk are you
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
ready to take a roll
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me is there any discussion
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
you don't like discussion not not seeing
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
ankle with your nails honey
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
you're not on mute uh representative
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
rogers i'm
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
just letting you know okay so mr clerk
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
would you take a roll
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative earth yes representative
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
weiler votes yes representative bean
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative walter
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
no representative rogers no
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that takes us down to two issues
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
um the sysc
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the dhhs
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple would you
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
would you just highlight or bring up the
 
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.710 align:start position:0%
would you just highlight or bring up the
dhhs

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget line request and then if you can
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
let's just um
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
go through the first 19 quickly so that
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
people know what those are
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
sorry we don't we don't need to do
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
anything i don't think other than
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
until this afternoon on it but but i
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
exchange

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to this or do you want
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
ms rounds to speak to it however you
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think i would ask karen to
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think she's able to i am sorry
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is a pretty standard process
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh lines 1 through 19 are
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
all change requests related to
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
financial reporting changes so they're
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
not programmatic changes
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
um they are changes in
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake in how we budgeted it
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what those changes are and
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
those net uh
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
about a 200 000
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
reduction in general funds um
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
and then number 20 uh you'll see that i
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
put some space between 19 and 20 so that
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's specifically
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um called out is related to new
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
we um joe christie spoke
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
about this issue uh in his presentation
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire hospital
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we talked about in that presentation
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
that we would provide a change request
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
issue so that's why it is reflected here
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
this is because there were enhancements
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
for mental health workers that were
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
just before the governor's budget was
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
finished they're voted on by governor
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
and council
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
and those enhancements were approved by
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
the because of how late it was in the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
they had already set the general fund
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
target and
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
there were not additional general funds
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
so to at least have a
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
total fund budget that was correct and
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
and reflect those expenditures
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
we added them as a hundred percent uh
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
other funds agency funds
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
but this request is to move them to
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
general funds which is where they
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
also um is there a last page
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
with some of this detail uh in written
 
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:37.829 align:start position:0%
with some of this detail uh in written
form

00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that what where that was mr ripple so
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
each one of these has
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
its own page of backup information
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm just focused on number 20 because
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
unless unless somebody wants to uh dig
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
into one of the other 19
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
i i just want us to know what we're
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing on 20 and then
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see here that there's no
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
change to any of the expenditure lines
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh only a change to the revenue
 
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
it's uh only a change to the revenue
lines

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay just you just said it i know you
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
did but
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
just say it one more time why
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
are we losing agency funds or is that
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
initially just a bookkeeping mistake to
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh so those agency funds really didn't
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
exist to begin with so it's not losing
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
anything as i mentioned during the
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
governor's phase
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
these enhancements for mental health
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
workers were approved by governor and
 
00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
workers were approved by governor and
council

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
it was too late in the governor's
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
process to
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh add additional general funds uh there
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
were no other general funds to be had if
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
you will in the governor's phase
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so we added this as agency income
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that the expenditures were correct so
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
the total expenditures being 74.4
 
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
the total expenditures being 74.4
million

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
and 74.5 million are correct it's
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we were not able to add the general
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
funds so the correct revenue
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
the revenue source is incorrect
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
okay so in the letter that the governor
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
sent subsequent to his budget process
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
where he listed a few pages of
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
priorities that he'd like to have added
 
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.309 align:start position:0%
priorities that he'd like to have added
back

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
did since this was since this missed the
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
governor's budget phase
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
did his prioritizations include this
 
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:38.630 align:start position:0%
did his prioritizations include this
line

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
then just for completeness sake mr
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
ripple if you have that
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital slide that we
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've already seen but it wouldn't hurt
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
i have the new hampshire hospital
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
presentation but i haven't found the
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
exact slide
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so i'll bring it up this could take a
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
minute though
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right ms rounds do you happen to
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
know which slide we should just go to
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
kevin it was it was towards the
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
middle to end of the new hampshire
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
hospital slides so
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
accomplishment

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i faintly remember this slide
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
but enough to know that i've seen it and
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
but i understood it at the time
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
um so are there any
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
let's do it this way are there any
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
requests for information from the
 
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.430 align:start position:0%
requests for information from the
committee

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
relative to lines 1 through 19
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.839 --> 01:00:08.309 align:start position:0%
 
view

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's no amendment number since these
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
are changes to the appropriations in
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1. i'm just pulling up the
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
trying to pull up the summary sheet
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
and there is only there's one other
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
thing that i would point out just to
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
confuse things a little bit
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned this in an email last
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
night that the department submitted
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
these 20 items
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
one packet and then they also submitted
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
a last item
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
pertaining to let me see here
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid administration they submitted
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
this to separate separately when we put
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
together the packet i accidentally added
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
it on
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
to the end this is not included in the
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
original 20 items and karen i don't know
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak to this one
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
in other words are you saying this is
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
competing to be item 21
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
well there are yes you could consider
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
this item 21.
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
it is not on the summary sheet but it is
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
a department request
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes so this was something that was
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
pointed out during the medicaid
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
presentation when we were going line by
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
line that the
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
transfer to other state agencies which
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
is the dish payment to new hampshire
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals seemed kind of high compared
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
to previous years
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
and you guys were absolutely correct it
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
was too high it doesn't match what new
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital is receiving for dish
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
so this is just making the adjustment
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the it's all federal to
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
actually represent what will be received
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
okay so so highlight the key line
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
for us if you would to see what we're
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
so because that's in parentheses
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's still a decrease though right the
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
6'5 is 6.5 million
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's a it's a decrease um to correct
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
what's actually being transferred to new
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals so that
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
34.2 million was actually was overstated
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
so that has no impact that that
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
that change has no impact on general
 
01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.190 align:start position:0%
that change has no impact on general
funds

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
and although we would like that extra
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
6.5 million
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
we're not eligible and so this is just
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
getting our budget to
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
represent what we really think is going
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
to happen exactly
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and to match what new hampshire hospital
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
all right so are there does the
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee have questions
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
on 19 on item 20
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
and if we've called this item 21 or
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is the time to get your questions
 
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
this is the time to get your questions
answered

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can maybe uh vote this
 
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.589 align:start position:0%

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
the enhancements at new hampshire
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
hospital for the mental health
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
workers were there enhancements at
 
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.829 align:start position:0%
workers were there enhancements at
glencliff

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
there are some long-standing
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
enhancements that have been in place
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
at glencliff for a long time i don't
 
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.589 align:start position:0%
at glencliff for a long time i don't
know

01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know that glenn cliff has mental
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
health workers i think they're mostly
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
nurses and those have been budgeted
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
for several years thank you i just
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure they
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
okay so um so with that
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i think um we're at the point where we
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
could take a recess
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
i i was saying that we needed to recess
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
until two
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
because it was uh my assumption that
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
we may have some documents coming in
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
from ols and we wanted to give them
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
maximum time
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple have you gotten everything
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
from ols
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
that you've been expecting or wanting
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have everything
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh and i believe the committee has
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
everything the last items outstanding
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
were the sununu center
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
amendments that i sent out last night
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
so okay so i i would
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh if if if we met again at one o'clock
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
instead of two o'clock
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
does that cause problems for
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
anyone yes okay what time do you need to
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
meet sir
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
well if i if i drive up for a
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
face-to-face meeting
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
at noon and if it goes an hour and then
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
i drive
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
home i'll be home at 2. so
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
so so let's go ahead and recess until 2
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
and at which time um we can
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
take votes on those 21 items that we
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
just looked at
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
that would buy you a few more minutes if
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
you're not able to join us sir
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then excuse me
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
and then i would think that um
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
at that point we'd be ready to go
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
through a walk through
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
the sununu center documents and that's
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
when i'd like to
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
turn the chair over to you and let you
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
walk us through that
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right and
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
and if you're not available are you okay
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
with representative wallner
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh maybe stepping in and walking us
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
through that
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes we're co-sponsors okay
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative walner would you be okay
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
um yes okay
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
well so uh the committee stands in
 
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%

okay so it's two o'clock we're back from
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%

um so this afternoon
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
we left it to uh look at the dhhs
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
line items where they at we're asking
 
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.190 align:start position:0%
line items where they at we're asking

for
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
support then we have
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
a planned discussion around the
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%

each of which plays a part in
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
facilitating a close down we had
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
postponed a house bill 254
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%

01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
as an hp2 and then i
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that we can uh then decide what
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
to do with hb
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
254. uh at that point
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to um i'm inviting now
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
and i will invite again uh
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative rogers to
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
walk us through her hb1 proposal
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
related to the family planning lines
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and um and i'll i'll check in with you
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
as we come towards the end of the sysc
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers to to see see
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
where you're at on that
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh okay so mr
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
ripple if you could pull up the line
 
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.750 align:start position:0%
ripple if you could pull up the line
items

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay so there's at least two ways of of
 
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
okay so there's at least two ways of of
uh

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
carving this up and i think
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
one way is um lines one through
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
20 on this sheet and then treat the
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical 21 as a separate issue
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
or we could do 1 through 19 then 20
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
then the hypothetical so um
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get a sense of the
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee now on if the committee
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
is interested in considering 1 through
 
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.390 align:start position:0%
is interested in considering 1 through
20

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
all in one piece or not if you do not
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
want to consider
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
1 through 20 all in one piece this is a
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
good time to
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anyone um okay
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
so um is there any conversation
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
right okay so i would uh i'd entertain a
 
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
right okay so i would uh i'd entertain a
motion

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the committee accept lines one
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
through twenty uh the
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
request by sources of funds for transfer
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
did you vote one through twenty or one
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
through nineteen
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
because the general fund increase i just
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
asked about one through twenty and
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
nobody had a problem with doing them all
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
at once
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
so it is one through twenty okay but i
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
think item 20 is the one that would
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
increase general funds by
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
4.3 million per year okay
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
so so you think we should go ahead and
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
do one through 19 separate that's fine
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
right we can do it that way so why would
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh for us to consider lines one through
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
nineteen as one unit of
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
transfers tumbler thank you is there a
 
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
transfers tumbler thank you is there a
second

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by two people
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
so um with it moved and seconded
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
i think for the record this is all
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
routine normal
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
cleanups and has no real significant
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
our general funds um
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay so not seeing any further
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh conversation on that um
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you take a roll okay
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
on the motion to accept uh
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%

anything yes
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's the chair that voted seven to
 
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
that's the chair that voted seven to
zero

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay so with that
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
done um let's move on to
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
item number 20 the acute psychiatric
 
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
item number 20 the acute psychiatric
services

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
where the agency funds are decreased and
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
general funds are added to to the tune
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
we discussed this over lunch prior to
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
lunch and we looked at the slide that
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital presented to
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
us over
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
a week ago um is there any
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on that mr ripple just for
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
completeness do you do you have
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
that slide from the new hampshire
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
hospital on this
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
it was like slide 34 or something like
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
it was i think i
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
closed it out um i can find it again
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
here hold on
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay i just thought seeing it might
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't give you a heads up
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
mental health worker enhancement it's
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
like slide 36 i was off a couple
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is to remind you what this is
 
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.270 align:start position:0%
um so this is to remind you what this is
about

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
the agency funds that were in the budget
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
aren't real and so they need
 
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.229 align:start position:0%
aren't real and so they need
geneticizable

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
geneticizable
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from this
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
a gen uh a replacement of
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
agency funds that aren't really there
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
and it would have to be backfilled with
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
general funds so this is in addition to
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
what we've done
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
it it would show up as an addition
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it mr ripple
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
yes approximately
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
i guess we got it well and also this is
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
this looks to be an explicit direct
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
effort to address the emergency room
 
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.149 align:start position:0%
effort to address the emergency room
boarding

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
boarding
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
situation which i think i think we've
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
all discussed as being
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
a critical thing for us to do but it is
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um not hearing any
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
and generally perceiving a reluctant
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
consensus to accept
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
um i would uh let's let's hear a motion
 
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.709 align:start position:0%
um i would uh let's let's hear a motion
on

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
accepting line 20 of the agency budgets
 
01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
accepting line 20 of the agency budgets
adjustment

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would move to accept line number 20
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the acute psychiatric services
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
transfer of funds from an agency account
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the general funds accounts
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
account is there a second second
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's so moved and seconded is there a
 
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
it's so moved and seconded is there a
discussion

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh mr clerk would you
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
take a roll
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
on the motion there the 4.2 and 4.8
 
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
on the motion there the 4.2 and 4.8
million

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth yes
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative wylo votes yes
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative bean
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative walner
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative rogers yes
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards yes
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
the vote is seven to zero okay thank you
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
um mr ripple could you go to the last
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
so remind me what this is
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
this is a decrease of 6.52 million
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
of transfers that to other state
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that won't take
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
place so this this looks like a
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in our general funds
 
01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:06.790 align:start position:0%
reduction in our general funds
obligations

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a general fund reduction it's a
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
federal fund reduction
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
but it would be for the reason that you
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay so is there a conversation on this
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we we this is out our control
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
anyways right i mean this is just
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're not getting this federal money so
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is we're getting our
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
books in alignment with the projected
 
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.310 align:start position:0%
books in alignment with the projected
reality

01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes is the four seven zero
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
is that the au um
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
what you said it's au 79 37.
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
so the motion on this would be to update
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
hb1 to reflect 6.512 million
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
less in federal funds availability
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
i would make that motion it also
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
includes the same amount of nearly that
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
same on the second year as well
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
second it so moved and seconded
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you call a roll
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay on the reduction of six and a half
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
million less federal funds
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative earth yes representative
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
weiler votes yes
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative bean yes
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative walnut yes representative
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative rogers yes
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards yes
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's the chair of the voters send them
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
to zero okay
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you so that's uh completed
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh i think we can go into the
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
sununu youth center conversation of the
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
amendments that we have to hp2
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to just share a couple of
 
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.149 align:start position:0%
i would like to just share a couple of
thoughts

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
that i that i worked out with mr ripple
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
and a little bit with representative
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
walner uh
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
with mr ripple uh we discussed
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know how is it possible for us to go
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
through these today and still finish
 
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.470 align:start position:0%
through these today and still finish
today

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
and given that we can anticipate there
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
are probably some areas that we need to
 
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.910 align:start position:0%
are probably some areas that we need to
fix

01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
like for example representative walner
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
noticed that
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
we had a consumer protection advocate
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and not a child protective
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
advocate in the text so that's like a
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
typo that needs to be fixed but there
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
are other things
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
for sure that as we go through these
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll want to fix
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it if we can
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
get agreement on what
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
kind of um modification or correction
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to make to these hb2 items
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
we can vote on it contingent upon
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
the changes being made by ols
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then if the changes come through ols
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
as we've voted for it then they're
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
agreed upon and
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and they've had our vote if
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
we send these to ols get them back and
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
what we want then we still have in the
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
house calendar
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
a work session for friday that we could
 
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.430 align:start position:0%
a work session for friday that we could
use

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
to as you know the one last thing to do
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
i really don't want to do that i hope we
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
can succeed in getting
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
this done today um and uh
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
so so then the other thing i would point
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
out is that there's a few things here
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh that have been proposed that may be
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh hardwiring with the hb2 that we leave
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
it to the discretion of the commission
 
01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.070 align:start position:0%
it to the discretion of the commission
to

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
to handle so that would mean that we
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
probably want to agree
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
on what the commission looks like
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
earlier in this conversation than later
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
but that's just a thought um and
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
at this point uh representative weiler
 
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.669 align:start position:0%
at this point uh representative weiler
if

01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
if you're prepared sir i'll i'll turn
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
chair position to you well i'll give it
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
a try and hope uh
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative helps me out the
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
first one that seems to try to combine
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
them all is number zero nine
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
five four h it's about seven pages it's
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
the most
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy one and what i'll try to do is
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
break it down
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
what the components are that went into
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
it and i'll ask
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
wong and help me out so it looked to me
 
01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
wong and help me out so it looked to me
like

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
zero nine five zero might be the
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this and i believe uh
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
mary jane correct me if i'm wrong this
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
is kind of bringing in 254
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
right okay so so zero nine
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
five zero uh starts off the way 254
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
did and that's the first roughly
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh pages of
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
zero nine five
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
four so representative weiler
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
could i just make makeup i i
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
so um well
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
you're doing fine and just when i had
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
looked at it i thought it actually might
 
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
looked at it i thought it actually might
be

01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
easier to go through the individual
 
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.030 align:start position:0%
easier to go through the individual
pieces

01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we had okay than to use the
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's strictly your true i mean it's
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
your choice i just
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
thought maybe the pieces were easier for
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
people to pull up the pieces
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
and look at them rather than to try to
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
go through it it is quite lengthy when
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
you put it all together
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
should we begin with 0926
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's where i started okay so 0926
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
is kind of a summation of
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 254
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it talks about not
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
putting so many children
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
in such um strict confinement
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and finding a way to find them
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh situation so that maybe there's
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
something comes of their confinement and
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
of their correction
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
and with the exceptions of murderers
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that seems like along the lines of
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
what i think we all have been working
 
01:22:54.239 --> 01:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
what i think we all have been working
toward

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
toward
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
um do we want to do these one at a time
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
and do a roll call or do we just want to
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
kind of do them all together and then
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
make a decision at the end
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair you're muted do you have any
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
i did i just went into the back bench
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
role pretty naturally
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
i i think um it's really how
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallner and you care to
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
proceed i
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
it it feels to me like we might
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
be able to make more progress if we just
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the components and
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
if if if they feel right to voting on
 
01:23:36.719 --> 01:23:37.350 align:start position:0%
if if if they feel right to voting on
them

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
let's vote on them if they don't feel
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
right because there's some other pieces
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that we want to look at
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
i i think maybe we should just try to
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
get our arms around the ones that
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
kind of fit together but i don't i don't
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
that puzzle in my head of how these
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
things fit together
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay and then representative nordgren
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
has her hand up sir
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
representing thank you
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
both of you your chairs so when we
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
met at lunch mary jane and kathy and i
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
we put them in the order we thought
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
we should talk about how it fit together
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
so help me out with the order heard me
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a chance to okay
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
so do you want me to go through the
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
order we had and if you don't like it
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
so the first one we had was as you said
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair was 9 26 that's number one
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay number number two we had was a
 
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.629 align:start position:0%
okay number number two we had was a
closure

01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
closure
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
which is nine three seven
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
all right give me a moment to find that
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
i've got it that'd be number two the
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
third one we thought was 950
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the creation of the
 
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
and that's the creation of the
commission

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
and i think we also saw one change there
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um so so that number is 950 that's
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
number three
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay and number four
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh is something i think
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh we thought
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
we thought this was something and i
 
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
we thought this was something and i
think

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh osborne
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
no wrong edwards mentioned
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
that uh some of them needed to just go
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
for them to deal with rather than us
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
trying to micromanage
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
so this one 930 would be
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
one that we thought should be out but
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
part of the commission charge
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then number five
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be 9 34
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
and this is also
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
something we thought the commission
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
should deal with
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is a contract for another state for
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the provision of secure
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
juvenile correctional services we
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
thought we did not want to preempt what
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
might decide and put this in an rsa
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
um talk about out of state right
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
right we also wanted to talk about the
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
650 000 that's in that but we can do
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
that when we get to number five
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
numbers number six uh
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
would be 932
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh we
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
we can get to that and discuss what we
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
thought our changes should be
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
but that would be number six 932
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
number seven would be
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that would be something that we
 
01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
and that would be something that we
should

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then the last one is number eight
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
and this is something we can talk about
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
when we get to it
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
um um i think the date of 222
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
is good because there there could be an
 
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
is good because there there could be an
interim

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
discussion with the commission about
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
with that entire state property so
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
i that's something we should talk about
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
talk about number eight which is 932
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
so that me trying to be organized
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i get a little obsessive about that
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
you got to get organized somehow all
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
right number one let's start with that
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
any uh any discussions any wishes to
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
change that
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
all right what i'm hoping is that we can
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
put aside and maybe in one vote
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh make a motion for like one two three
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
seven eight or whatever like however we
 
01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
seven eight or whatever like however we
decide

01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
but this is basically 254 we've had time
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
to look at this
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's the way that the uh the last bill
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
any objection to putting that in a
 
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:48.790 align:start position:0%
any objection to putting that in a
collection

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i i do have a question on
 
01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:57.340 align:start position:0%
the effective dates um uh
 
01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
the effective dates um uh
[Music]

01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
sorry um hey um
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
ms o'neill uh sent us a really nice
 
01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:06.470 align:start position:0%
ms o'neill uh sent us a really nice
document

01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh summarizing some some questions i had
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
put to her
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
and in her response
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i i thought may
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
be helpful is she laid out a
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
projected um
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
project timeline and
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
i just am curious if these effective
 
01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.590 align:start position:0%
i just am curious if these effective
dates

01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
dates
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
conflict with that or if we want to try
 
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.189 align:start position:0%
conflict with that or if we want to try
to

01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not worth trying to wrestle
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
ms o'neill's projected project timelines
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
with these effective dates
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
i i would draw my my comment i just
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
talked myself out of it
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i thought it might be useful to make
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we weren't
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
breaking anything by taking her project
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
timelines it may make a lot of sense
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then immediately having the wrong
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
effective dates here
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
well if if the if we empower the
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
commission to do a lot of this
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
time setting and goal setting contract
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
that may take care of itself yes sir the
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
difference here is this is the
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration standards though yes
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty big one where the
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
effective dates i think really need to
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
be important
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
so do you think they need to be earlier
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
than march 22.
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
i i i ask the question i don't i defer
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
to the experienced folks on the on the
 
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
to the experienced folks on the on the
committee

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
if that's if those look like the right
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
effective dates on
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
changing incarceration standards
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
well this is toward the end of the time
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're giving them say from july 1st to
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
the following march so
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
at about that time they should be taken
 
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
at about that time they should be taken
seriously

01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
a change of incarceration and start to
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
begin the process of getting all the
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
people out of there so
 
01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:06.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
i think i i think the march date
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think the march date works will work
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you know but as i thought about this
 
01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.470 align:start position:0%
um you know but as i thought about this
whole

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
um group of amendments and
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
this whole issue is there are a lot of
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
people who have a lot of
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
different opinions about about this and
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is that we're sort of
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're helping us take the first
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
step obviously the senate is going to
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
weigh in
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of people who have a
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
differing opinions and um that are going
 
01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:40.550 align:start position:0%
differing opinions and um that are going
to

01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
have their chance to weigh in on it so i
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
think what we need to do is put it out
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
there if it seems like
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
the march date is wrong i think we can
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
work with the senate around that
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
um the senate will have their own
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts and then we'll come together as
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference and probably
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
um come up with a final
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
a final proposal so i sort of see it as
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
a this is
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
sort of like the first step we're sort
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
of on first base here
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rogers
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah the um commitment date was passed
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
by child and family law
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
which is a policy committee and i think
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
that they did a lot of work on that so
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that we should um trust the
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
policy committee on what they did on
 
01:32:20.639 --> 01:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
policy committee on what they did on
this

01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
and not second guess them okay
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if there's nothing
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
further on
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
on this zero nine two six h we'll put it
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
in a queue
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
to perhaps be voted on in one vote
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
we move on to zero nine three
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
seven this is the closure in the
 
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:47.189 align:start position:0%
seven this is the closure in the
transfers

01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
for incarceration july 1st 2022 that's
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
what we talked about
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
what we wanted then the
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee the general courts will
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
have authority to accept funds from any
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
source to approve the transfer of funds
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding other provisions neither
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
the department of health human services
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
or any other administration agency or
 
01:33:06.639 --> 01:33:07.510 align:start position:0%
or any other administration agency or
authority

01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
remember the executive branch of
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
government shall expend or commit the
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures of any funds from any
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
source to directly or indirectly fund
 
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.189 align:start position:0%
source to directly or indirectly fund
this

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
centers for a successor state facility
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
kind of make that clear of that closing
 
01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
kind of make that clear of that closing
date

01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
if not i'll place it in the queue for
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
collective vote
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay then the next one
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
i think i've got yeah i've got him in
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
the right order zero nine
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
five zero h very critical this is the
 
01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.830 align:start position:0%
five zero h very critical this is the
commission

01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we talked about having a correction
 
01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:46.390 align:start position:0%
and we talked about having a correction
here

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
the director of the office of consumer
 
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:49.990 align:start position:0%
the director of the office of consumer
advocate

01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to change that to what
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes i think i think the consumer
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
advocate would be really surprised to
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
hear that um
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think we met child advocate
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
there all right
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
make that uh revision subject to change
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
i will say on this one uh chairman
 
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.149 align:start position:0%
i will say on this one uh chairman
weiler

01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different opinions
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
i've received
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
two or three um emails this morning
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
about differing um commission members i
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
haven't really had
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
a chance to really think all of that
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
a chance to really think all of that
through

01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um what we have here before us is a
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
is a proposal but i think it's another
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
one of those things i think that
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
over the next several weeks
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
we can probably work on trying to flush
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.510 align:start position:0%
we can probably work on trying to flush
out

01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
who the appropriate who might be
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate i
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
i just have i have not had the time to
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
go through all the different suggestions
 
01:35:12.639 --> 01:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
go through all the different suggestions
so

01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah and we see that they have short
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
time to work we want to report by
 
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
time to work we want to report by
september

01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
30th of this year they may not be
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
appointed until july
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't have much time
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh chairman uh edwards
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
so i i have just two comments on this uh
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
one of them is
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
similar we we call out waypoint by name
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
and we call out the disability rights
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
center by name
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and i i i'm not sure exactly what
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
the disability rights center is but
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
but when we call out waypoint i think
 
01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.270 align:start position:0%
but when we call out waypoint i think
waypoint

01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
waypoint
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
is one of several organizations that are
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
space and i would uh although they
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
they may end up having somebody
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
designated from waypoint
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think calling out one
 
01:36:09.199 --> 01:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
i don't think calling out one
organization

01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
by name unless it's a state agency
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
is is is just good policy when we're
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i i i would like to find a more
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
generic way
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
to reference that representative of
 
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.109 align:start position:0%
to reference that representative of
waypoint

01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
waypoint
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe of the disability rights
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
center i have
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
my second point is that i
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
think we really need to have
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the neighborhood family support
 
01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.270 align:start position:0%
sort of the neighborhood family support
group

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
whoever community this might go into
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
these may go into i think we need to
 
01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.149 align:start position:0%
these may go into i think we need to
have

01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't know for the lack of a better
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
word you know the the
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
the mom's view of her raising her family
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
where these kids may be transferred to
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like a public safety advocate to be
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the commission
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
because if we get a bunch of people who
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
all sort of think the same that we have
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
to take care of these kids
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the other point of
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
view that well we got to also take care
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the safety of the community
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
i just think we may miss a vital
 
01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:20.790 align:start position:0%
i just think we may miss a vital
representation

01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
so but that's my thought and and
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
but to representative walner's point
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
i i'm okay with us
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
um somehow communicating to the
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
senate that this commission membership
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
would need some work
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay you can't offhand think of a group
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
that would serve the purpose of the
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
public safety advocate
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i can't i i think you know the you
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
know the members of the
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee may know people or know a way
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
to say that i i just don't
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is not my subject matter
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
but you know you uh are opposed to
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
pointing out by name
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
waypoint and disability rights well more
 
01:38:09.119 --> 01:38:10.149 align:start position:0%
waypoint and disability rights well more
waypoint

01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
waypoint
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
i because i'm not really sure what the
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
disability rights center is
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
if that's a government entity uh part of
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
and it's i think it's fine if they're
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
not then i think it's worth a discussion
 
01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
not then i think it's worth a discussion
to

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not picking you
 
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not picking you
know

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
picking our jury i don't know here's
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
here's my thought
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
people that came forward and were
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
willing to help were mike skibby
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
disability rights center and of course
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
john dejoy
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
from waypoint willing to take an active
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
role and
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of person that if you
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
put it on this commission
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
would stay active and have a good
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
background obviously they had enough
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
background to come forward
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
to talk to us so i think that's why
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know their names ended up in here
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
because they had already
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to be involved and you know if we
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
put somebody on
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
that is this a short time
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
i've had things like this before where
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
we put together a commission
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we waited for some group to appoint
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
someone to the commission
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
and we waited and waited and now we only
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a short couple of months here to
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
come up with a decision and if we're
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
waiting a month and a half for somebody
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
to appoint something from a group
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the rest of them are sitting around
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
wondering when they're going to
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
call a meeting so it makes sense yes or
 
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
call a meeting so it makes sense yes or
no

01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm fully prepared to determine your
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
judgment i
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
i but that doesn't keep me from having a
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
stray opinion sorry
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right but um you know i think that
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to hit the ground running i
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
can depend on two people john dejoy and
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
mike skibby to
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
jump right in uh and let's have you know
 
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
jump right in uh and let's have you know
less

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
problem and sometimes it's the senate
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
that holds us up with
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
appointing people because i don't see
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
any of them want to be interested
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the even the direct
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate well that's
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
that's the state employee so they ought
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to come right over there
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
director of division for children needs
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
and families yup
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
so if we want people
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
hit the ground running and as soon as
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
this passes
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
then i think if we left those two people
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
and it will happen
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh we'll try to talk to the senate in
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
the meantime about
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
i agree with you there's going to be a
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of objection
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
15 year old boys next to my 12 year old
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
daughter or something you know did you
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the senate will have somebody who
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
will something will occur to us in the
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
meantime so that's
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
number three that may go in the queue
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
without objection
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative rogers something
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
yeah um as far as a public safety
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
advocate or somebody there
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
to speak to that um if this site is
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
are there sites that are going into the
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
community they will obviously deal with
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
the local people
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and um there will be hearings as far as
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
various locations in the community
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
and at that point the local police will
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
be involved as far as
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
where they're cited and priestful there
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
so i think that each of the localities
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
will have their public safety
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
advocates involved at that time so i
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's something that the
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
commission will be dealing with
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
and probably also the local planning
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
board correct
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know okay so without objection i'll
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
put that in the collective queue for now
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
number three
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
move on to number four which is zero
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
nine three zero
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is the contract is currently
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
providing residential treatment for
 
01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:36.629 align:start position:0%
providing residential treatment for
children

01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
contractors should comply and so on and
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
the dcyf shall negotiate contracts for
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
residential placement with minors in new
 
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
residential placement with minors in new
hampshire

01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for commitment and so
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
it empowers them
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf to begin working on
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me getting additional
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh places outside of
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
sununu youth center which is kind of
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
compulsory after you accept 254 on the
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
first part of this
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
the uh any comments on that part
 
01:42:08.639 --> 01:42:11.669 align:start position:0%
the uh any comments on that part
represent

01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
um i would like to see i i i think this
 
01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:15.189 align:start position:0%
um i would like to see i i i think this
part

01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
could come out and um leave this to the
 
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.430 align:start position:0%
could come out and um leave this to the
commission

01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i think this is yeah this is the
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of thing the commission
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
and certainly dcyf has the authority
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
already i believe probably to negotiate
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
contracts so
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
um i would i would personally leave this
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
this piece out anyone object to leaving
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
this out
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
your hand or speak up if without
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
objection we will take this out
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
nice guys your question about that ever
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
would i'm fine with it coming out i'm
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering though would dcoaf
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
would at least somebody from this or
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
some part of the state be responsible
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
for doing that this
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
what this refers to dcy of doing as
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to somebody outside of the state
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
i mean if we don't have something in
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
directing them to do something you don't
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
think they will
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking if you remove this piece
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah are we still
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
sure that the state will be negotiating
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
contracts whether
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the commission negotiating
 
01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the commission negotiating
contracts

01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
um all right left in
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
i know i'm just asking the question i i
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative nordgren do you have
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
the answer well
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but but i would think that
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
it would be the purview of the
 
01:43:40.719 --> 01:43:41.669 align:start position:0%
it would be the purview of the
commission

01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
to make recommendations to the
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
department i don't
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
believe the commission would negotiate
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
with contractors
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't think this exact wording
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
what's put in the commission's charge
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
but i do think
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
that it would be better not to have it
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
in this package the way it is
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay so unless uh unless representative
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
earth wants me to leave it in i'll take
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
no i'll go with the judgment of the
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
people that have been here longer than i
 
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.109 align:start position:0%
people that have been here longer than i
have

01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir this is just a process issue but
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
as we go through and we
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
drop these things that we're considering
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
and saying the commission can do it
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
i just hope we're keeping track of so
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
that in the commission's
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
section we're adding responsibilities so
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
okay we'll make sure we have that
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
language in there we'll review that once
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
more before we do the final
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay number five i guess i had a note on
 
01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:50.070 align:start position:0%
okay number five i guess i had a note on
this

01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
um again securing secure juvenile
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
corrective service contract
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
department

01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
and compliance the prison this is prison
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i think this this one this one
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
talks about um sending some of the
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
children out of state
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that um it's
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not a good idea to send
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
children out of state it's really
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a bad it's bad for children and
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
but also i think that we have to let the
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
commission try to
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
try to come to um some decisions
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
about what kinds of facilities there
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be available in new
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire so um
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
i would i would leave this piece out
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem like it really belongs
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
in this sorry my dog doesn't like it
 
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
in this sorry my dog doesn't like it
either

01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative my concern if you
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
take it out is
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're setting a date certain for closing
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
and if by that time they've not found a
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
place to put those
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
people that cannot be placed in the
 
01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.590 align:start position:0%
people that cannot be placed in the
community

01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
and the only alternative is out of state
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
isn't this essentially saying
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
that option is available to you
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
i guess uh speak for representative
 
01:46:22.159 --> 01:46:22.870 align:start position:0%
i guess uh speak for representative
waldman

01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
waldman
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to make people think
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way we start out
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
immediately but
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
within six or eight months maybe
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
somebody will have some alternative that
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
they will
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
find it an abandoned jail or a van and
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
that uh would work they could make
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
clear enough to fulfill this
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
this requirement okay so
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
we we will hopefully have time next
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
session if these things don't happen
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
start putting more legislation in
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
could i just speak for one a minute a
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom though we did have an
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation here of 650 000
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
and i think i think no matter
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
what we're going to need those pieces of
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
funding that piece of funding um to help
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
with um finding
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate places for these for these
 
01:47:23.119 --> 01:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
appropriate places for these for these
children

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the next piece that we're
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
in um this series of amendments
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
is the contingency fund so i i would
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
i would move when we get to the
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
contingency fund that we move the 650
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
to the contingency so the department has
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
the funding it's going to need for for
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
places for these children
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's no matter what they how
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
they decide to deal with
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
um those children i didn't think we had
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
money in this
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
number five like it's right down at the
 
01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
number five like it's right down at the
bottom

01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
bottom
um

01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
see it online all right so we can add
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
that to the next one
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's needed all right with that
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
with that in mind
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
anybody uh object to
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
leaving this for the commission moving
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
so that one's out with the money moving
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
into this number six which is zero nine
 
01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:27.990 align:start position:0%
into this number six which is zero nine
three

01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
two so we add
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
i guess when we get through we'll have
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
ols unless we want to accept
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
what we've done without the thought in
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
mind but i don't suppose that's correct
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
we would do it
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
so number six
 
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.950 align:start position:0%
so number six
is

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
kevin i did rewrite some words didn't i
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
um to add to 650 to bring the 650
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
so i added to the 14
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
to the 1.4 million i added the 650
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to two 2 million
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
used for related activity these
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
contingency funds may be
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
used to contract for contract amendments
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh employee retraining and relocation
 
01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.149 align:start position:0%
uh employee retraining and relocation
costs

01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
and other expenses as necessary
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think the department would would know
 
01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
i think the department would would know
which

01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
which expenses they're going to need
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
funding to
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
to to do and then the um
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
the funding should not lapse um until
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
so that would take care of six anything
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
else and number
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
six anybody else representing earth well
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
just going back to
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
934 that particular
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph by the money make specific
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
reference to rsa 169-b
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
colon 15-c is that
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
and basically expended to accomplish the
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
purposes of that
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
rsa now i've not looked at that rsa but
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
might be relevant that that be included
 
01:50:48.639 --> 01:50:49.750 align:start position:0%
might be relevant that that be included
in

01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
what representative wallner just
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
suggested good suggestion
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay rsa 169
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
percent okay i'm sorry
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
15 sweet okay
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
you get that uh mr ripple i'm bringing
 
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:09.750 align:start position:0%
you get that uh mr ripple i'm bringing
it

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
i do have that reference yes i'm just
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
bringing up
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
mentioned

01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that statutory reference for the
 
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
so that statutory reference for the
entire

01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
plus million that would be in the other
 
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.950 align:start position:0%
plus million that would be in the other
amendment

01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
this is just for the 650 the other
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment relocation
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
and training and other stuff that
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.719 --> 01:51:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so i'm trying to look that up
 
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
good and i can find 15
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and 15 a
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't see a 15 c
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
i guess this would create it what is
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
what is the rest of 169 about
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
um no detention at jail is 169-b
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
colon 15. following arraignment
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
no minor shall be attained in any
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
facility where adults charge
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
actually this i think is important
 
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.149 align:start position:0%
actually this i think is important
because

01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of the points that i've heard
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
expressed is that these
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
folks must not be put into or not be
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
jailed with adults that's what this is
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
is b is a excuse me and b
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
is notification of write to request
 
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.830 align:start position:0%
is notification of write to request
records

01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't see a c unless these
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
documents that we're going through now
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
specify a c this would create one i
 
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.790 align:start position:0%
specify a c this would create one i
guess

01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'll just draw your attention to that
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
one of the sections i'm not sure which
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
one but i'm looking at the omnibus
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment now
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
so there's probably more to this
 
01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
language than just this one
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
as long as it's included in the where
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative walnut said we should
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
move the money to
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and kept with that money i think is
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably the important piece right
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
all right so the omnibus one
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative weiler yes that um that
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
is in the out-of-state placement part
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's just needed for the out-of-state
 
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's just needed for the out-of-state
placement

01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
placement
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that rsa would have been created it's
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
not really needed
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's only for out of state
 
01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:37.830 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's only for out of state
right

01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that's not needed it would be if we
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
had the out of state placement it would
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
be needed but with this it's not
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's creating a new um rsa
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
so if we can't find any other place for
 
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:50.229 align:start position:0%
so if we can't find any other place for
these

01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need that rsa you still don't
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
need that rsa
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
we don't it would be a new one that
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
would be created under the um
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
the out-of-state placement section we're
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
six fifty thousand there's a legal
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
opinion so without objection we'll leave
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay i just want no money someone called
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
me and told me that it worked on writing
 
01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
me and told me that it worked on writing
it

01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
very good all right
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
so um take the 650 000
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
without the rsa language and place it
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
in number six
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
which is 0932h well i don't think you
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
need the money there because the money
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
was for the out-of-state placement
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
but but they will still need to well
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
even if there's an in-state placement
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
they need the money
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
right they'll still need the money for
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
they'll still need the money for placing
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
those children
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
for finding placement for those children
 
01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
for finding placement for those children
um

01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think that the objection really has
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
designating out of state is like the
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
first thing we do
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the department and
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
will still need to find placements for
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
those children
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
what i mean there may there the
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
commission will probably have
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of experts come in we have set
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
aside a hundred thousand dollars for
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
them to hire
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
an expert to come in and a consultant to
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
help them um with some of those
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
decisions so
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think they'll still need and this is
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
not we have not given them very much
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
money to do this
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay but nonetheless then are you then
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
tying them the 650 000
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
at least to the placement as opposed to
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
just a generic amount of money
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
added into the next section
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh contract amendments which could be
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendments with
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
um would be amendments with existing
 
01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.830 align:start position:0%
um would be amendments with existing
providers

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think i think
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the way i wrote it that might
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
not be the
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
legal that would certainly
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
give the department the flexibility to
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
do what they needed to do
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
well i'm just trying to understand what
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying i think this number
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
34 as you've explained it to me is
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
related to the placement of the children
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
or the young adults that can't be placed
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
and all i'm asking is should the and so
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
if that's true
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
then this money seems to be associated
 
01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:30.629 align:start position:0%
then this money seems to be associated
with

01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
that desire whether it's in state or out
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
of state
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
and if we're then going to move this
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
money to a different
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
place shouldn't go along with the notion
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
of placement that's what i'm trying to
 
01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.310 align:start position:0%
of placement that's what i'm trying to
understand

01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative waller is that the way
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
well i just i i moved the money i i just
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
moved the 650
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
000 into the contingency plan
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
um into the contingency amendment
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
so that the department could would have
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
that money available
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i guess my concern is they come back
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and save money to put them into
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
other placements as opposed to but
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
should we add that in the list of things
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that should be added as an
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because otherwise
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
it could all get used up in placement
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
and training and
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
oh gee we didn't know we need to put
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
money aside for that
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know so yeah i think i think we'd
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
if this was dedicated to the placement
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
encouragement so representative irfa or
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
maybe kevin can could we add
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
that in the list would that be the right
 
01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.070 align:start position:0%
that in the list would that be the right
place

01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
or should we take the 650 and have a
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
separate sentence
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think you could add it to the language
 
01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
i think you could add it to the language
here

01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
so add it to the list and what would we
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
what do we say 650 000
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
shall be given to this organization and
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
the dcyf
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
to provide for secure
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
confinement for the the few
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh ones who are not entitled to be moved
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
to a lesser confinement
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm okay with that kind of language
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
just being another clause of the
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that you guys you're trying to
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
do representative walmart
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
relocation costs and
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh placement of those that cannot be
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
placed in the community
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
yep and 650 000
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the placement of those who cannot be
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
placed in the community
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay so in that case i would say that of
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
the 2.05 million
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
650 000
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
shall be used for the purposes of secure
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
those who cannot be placed in community
 
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.229 align:start position:0%
those who cannot be placed in community
settings

02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
settings
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
is that correct let's see where the 2.0
 
02:00:30.159 --> 02:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
is that correct let's see where the 2.0
is

02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's included in the 1.4 all right
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
okay so number six
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
is going to have that language added
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
also employee return retraining
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
retention relocation
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
cost uh described in action
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
something an alternative prison capacity
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
where is that described section
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
something do we need to write something
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
because number seven has similar
 
02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:28.790 align:start position:0%
because number seven has similar
language

02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
zero nine four two h we've got a half a
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we should maybe we should take
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we should take out
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
um employee reta training and relocation
 
02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:44.149 align:start position:0%
um employee reta training and relocation
costs

02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just in the list of things
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
that are allowed but in
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
devon we really specify that it's to be
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
used for that
 
02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.109 align:start position:0%
used for that
[Music]

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
so we have we have a lot of things in
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
contract amendments employee retraining
 
02:02:06.239 --> 02:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
contract amendments employee retraining
relocation

02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
so number seven is kind of repetitive
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
unless we had to add that money back in
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
well did you want me to remove the
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
retraining and relocation costs from
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
the new number six or did you want to
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
change number seven instead
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if seven is is duplicative
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
of six
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:40.450 align:start position:0%
i think seven does more than just um
 
02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:42.310 align:start position:0%
i think seven does more than just um
[Music]

02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
then just provide the funding for the uh
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
training and
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about filling positions in
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
existing state agencies with
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
priority given to state employees
 
02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.229 align:start position:0%
priority given to state employees
displays

02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
displays
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i think this is really important
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have a valuable workforce
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center um who certainly
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of skills
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we want to be sure that they
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
get first
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know get the first ability to go in
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
jobs that are available within the
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
department or within
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
could be complying from fine five six
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
what why don't we do this why don't why
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't we take out
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
of six since it seems like it is
 
02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.310 align:start position:0%
of six since it seems like it is
repetitive

02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
repetitive
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
why don't we take out of the list in six
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we take out employee
 
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:46.950 align:start position:0%
why don't we take out employee
retraining

02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
retraining
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
and relocation costs just take it out of
 
02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
and relocation costs just take it out of
there

02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
and address that in seven
 
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:59.430 align:start position:0%
and address that in seven
okay

02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
take it out of six and leave it in seven
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'm putting the 650 000 in two six
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah put the 650 000 into six
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then do the the employees will be a
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
separate amendment
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i think i've got it so
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
just so unclear the language we're
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
looking at now the new number six
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
employee retraining and relocation costs
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be removed
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
so is literally all that's left for
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
contract amendments
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
as as well as the 650 thousand dollar
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
carve out for
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
placements for those who can't be placed
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
we want those included okay so does the
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
2.05 million still remain in the new
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
number six
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i have a question okay
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
when we say retraining and relocation
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about the word relocation
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
in in the corporate world that means
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we would pay
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
all the moving expenses related to
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
moving from one part of the state to the
 
02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.629 align:start position:0%
moving from one part of the state to the
next

02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and and that can be eighty ninety 90 000
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
per household are we are we meaning
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
to move somebody from manchester
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
up to coast county if that's the
 
02:05:29.119 --> 02:05:32.550 align:start position:0%
up to coast county if that's the
relocation

02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
i i did i i did not write that words
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
those words so i don't know what
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
if representative weiler has an opinion
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
on that i think there might be
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
it might be possible that we if our
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
workforce at glencliff
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
is really in
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
as bad as i mean if they they need if
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
they need people up there that might
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
might be something you might really want
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
well if we make it partial relocation
 
02:06:06.719 --> 02:06:08.069 align:start position:0%
well if we make it partial relocation
costs

02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
so so you want to you want to help them
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
pay for some of their
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
expenses of selling their house moving
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
their household goods
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
arriving at the new location with
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
closing fees
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the kind of thing that
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
goes into a reload
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i recommend deleting the word
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
relocation myself
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
because that i i think it's ill-defined
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
and it could be
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
tremendously expensive yeah i had a
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
neighbor that had
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
relocation costs he moved a wood pile
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i thought i can't believe it but
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else was paying for it
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
so so and unless we have a good
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
definition for that i
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
i would ask
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
all right any objection to deleting
 
02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
all right any objection to deleting
relocation

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
could we leave in something like
 
02:07:07.599 --> 02:07:08.470 align:start position:0%
could we leave in something like
training

02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
job training and incentives to fill jobs
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
which exists within state government
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we could change it to incentives
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's a little more negotiable
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
at one point i remember years ago and i
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
can't remember in one of these
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
in one one one previous try
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
um we talked about um severance pay
 
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.310 align:start position:0%
um we talked about um severance pay
packages

02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
packages
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
and um i mean that that was all
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's not included here but i
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
mean we have had a lot
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
of discussion with the kind of things
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
that would cost
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we should be providing for
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
employees when we're closing this
 
02:07:48.239 --> 02:07:52.709 align:start position:0%
employees when we're closing this
facility

02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
well retraining is a big
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
returning's good yeah see if it's six
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
months to do it
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
and we're paying them while they're
 
02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
and we're paying them while they're
retraining

02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
retraining
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
and you know that could that could be
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
expensive to give them the regular pay
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
for six months while
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to school may even be more than
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then maybe incentives
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hurt so much but if it's
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.110 --> 02:08:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
[Music]
that

02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
anybody objectively taking out
 
02:08:38.079 --> 02:08:41.270 align:start position:0%
anybody objectively taking out
relocation

02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right without objection let's take
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
out relocation
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i couldn't believe it when
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
this guy moved the wood pile
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
and he had a bunch of furniture that he
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
almost got rid of after he moved because
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
the house he moved in it wasn't as big
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
minus the six whatever
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
refers to sections are we gonna write
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
those sections or yeah
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna rewrite them a
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
little bit six and seven
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay because it talks about contract
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendments describing section and
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
alternative prison prison capacity
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
described in section
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay so my understanding was that
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
this new
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
wording that i'm sharing on the screen
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
was going to replace 932
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure oh okay that makes it easy
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
will be replaced in its entirety by the
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
language i'm sharing right now
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
right minus relocation costs minus
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
minus one location minus relocation
 
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:04.229 align:start position:0%
minus one location minus relocation
costs

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
minus employee retraining still no no we
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
leave that in
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay so only minus relocation costs
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the carve out for six hundred fifty
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars previously discussed
 
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars previously discussed
okay

02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
president organ has her hand up by mr
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
chairman okay
 
02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
chairman okay
representative

02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
did we want to add the word incentives
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
in there or is that just
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
adding a complication that's in
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment 942 yeah well he's left in
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
other expenses
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
as necessary to cover that probably
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
covers it thank you
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
i hope depending on who the people are
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
so that so we changed six
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
i think you need the same change in
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
seven to take relocation out
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and that's where
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
is it there yes
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
line four okay
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay good that should be good
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
any anything else are we uh accepting
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
seven and six as rewritten
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
six is rewritten and seven the objection
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
to seven
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
well with this amendment if seven is
 
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
well with this amendment if seven is
942.

02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
942.
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh did you already remove the word
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
relocation in line one
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
and and are we correcting the typo in
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
the year
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
of line three not yet
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
all right every training relocation yeah
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
we should take relocation
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
out of line one you could say unrelated
 
02:12:20.239 --> 02:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
out of line one you could say unrelated
incentives

02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah related change into related
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the changes to this one the
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
removal of relocation in two places and
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
fixing the typo in the fiscal year on
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
line three
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and then i'm just curious if this
 
02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
yeah and then i'm just curious if this
is

02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
if the if the intent of this is actually
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
necessary because
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
the prioritization of an employee being
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
moved to another position within the
 
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
moved to another position within the
state

02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
if their positions being phased out i
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
would assume is already in law somewhere
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
because that's just the rational human
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
resource thing to do
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just i kind of wonder if this
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the money component of it
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
again it's not my area though i don't i
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't know i don't have any experience
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
with that either
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just you know make sure that
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
um it's understood that these employees
 
02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
um it's understood that these employees
will

02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
be able to be prioritized
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
well personally i'm i'm fine with saying
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
it twice but
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
some people aren't if this is already an
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
rsa somewhere i just
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's redundant so it's not
 
02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.669 align:start position:0%
and if it's redundant so it's not
embarrassing

02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
embarrassing
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have an objection so
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending june 30th 20
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
oh i see this yeah it doesn't have zeros
 
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
oh i see this yeah it doesn't have zeros
okay

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
2022.

02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
is uh 0933
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is where they take possession
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
and they can consult with manchester for
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't forbid them from
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
well it does say consistent with the
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
expressed city interest does that mean
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
as long as they want to pay enough we
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to pay a decent price
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
earlier when we talked about an intense
 
02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:02.069 align:start position:0%
earlier when we talked about an intense
statement

02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
i i quoted the idea of saying that
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was to have this
 
02:15:08.079 --> 02:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was to have this
property

02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
repurposed to tax production
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
certain uses and i
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
i would hate to see this beautiful
 
02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:19.589 align:start position:0%
i would hate to see this beautiful
campus

02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
campus
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
that could be a wonderful software
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
development center
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
like they have out in silicon valley of
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
california i'd hate to see that turned
 
02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:28.950 align:start position:0%
california i'd hate to see that turned
into

02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
manchester's new city hall i i think
 
02:15:31.679 --> 02:15:32.229 align:start position:0%
manchester's new city hall i i think
that's

02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
valuable a property to not
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
get a highly productive use out of it
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm uncomfortable with this disposal
 
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm uncomfortable with this disposal
approach

02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
well it says for the best interest of
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
the states
 
02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:58.709 align:start position:0%
the states
so

02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
expressive city interests and the
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
interests of the state
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
did you say the best interest of the
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative oh
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yeah i i think um
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
when we've been talking um all afternoon
 
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
about the commission
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
and not and not giving them direction
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
on how to do things but letting them
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
go through their process i worry also
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
worried about
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
the disposal word in this section
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
because that might not be to the benefit
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
of the state and i
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
worry that we shouldn't have that in an
 
02:16:50.399 --> 02:16:52.870 align:start position:0%
worry that we shouldn't have that in an
rsa

02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
what word would you use i guess i
 
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:56.469 align:start position:0%
what word would you use i guess i
wouldn't

02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i wouldn't i would have them
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
take possession
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
well it's kind of a neutral word like
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
we had a disposition motion on this bill
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
in other words have we disposed of it
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
but we find a way to finish
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
with it so well it depends what you mean
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
by the word disposed does it mean we
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
give it
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
to another department in the state or we
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
just sell it tune outside interest i
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
guess i just
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
worry about binding the state
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
and the commission into doing something
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that might need more discussion
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
do we have to say anything can we just
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
delete the language and
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
not decide that today right i think we
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
should just take
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think we should just end this
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph where it said
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
south river road manchester new
 
02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.230 align:start position:0%
south river road manchester new
hampshire

02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
and leave the rest of it out you leave
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
it up to administrative services
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the administrative services shall
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
take possession
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then not direct them what to do
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
although luke alessandra will probably
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
add back in every
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
time i know i i think lou's gonna
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
probably be messing with this quite a
 
02:18:33.519 --> 02:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
probably be messing with this quite a
bit

02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
all right any uh any support for that
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
taking out all this stuff after uh
 
02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.509 align:start position:0%
taking out all this stuff after uh
standing

02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
i like her suggestion
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay if nobody puts a hand up on
 
02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:53.669 align:start position:0%
okay if nobody puts a hand up on
representative

02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
wallner no i'm i'm i'm fine with what
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
sharon said
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
what representative norbert said okay
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
um but you still have your hand up
 
02:19:04.319 --> 02:19:05.110 align:start position:0%
um but you still have your hand up
representative

02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry all right so if nobody
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
objects that's
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
where this thing will end um right
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
all right so we've been through the
 
02:19:20.559 --> 02:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
all right so we've been through the
sections

02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
sections
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
that kind of mirror what's in the
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
leaving out some other parts that uh
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
are more objectionable by some of the
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
folks and
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what do you recommend should
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
we make a motion on the parts that we
 
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:38.709 align:start position:0%
we make a motion on the parts that we
have

02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
approved or just leave it in your hands
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
to write in another omnibus
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh amendment um
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
so here's what i'm thinking i'll briefly
 
02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.950 align:start position:0%
so here's what i'm thinking i'll briefly
summarize

02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what you want out of
 
02:19:53.439 --> 02:19:54.389 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what you want out of
these

02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay i think it would probably be best
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
if i
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
bring these to os they redraft
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
whether in the form of individual
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
amendments or an optimist amendment i'm
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
but then i'll send that back out to you
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
i had originally suggested friday but
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps tomorrow or
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
the the chair can weigh in on what what
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
date is best
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
the division should come back and then
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
the revised amendments i think that's
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
the approach
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
i had originally suggested friday but i
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
that it was so early in the week i
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was wednesday or thursday
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
so you do have a work session scheduled
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow at 9 30 and you could use
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards what's your
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
all right i'm here i'm sorry i just
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
i've been muting myself so that i don't
 
02:20:58.720 --> 02:20:59.670 align:start position:0%
i've been muting myself so that i don't
uh

02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i can resist the temptation just
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
burst in
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
so um what i think we maybe ought to do
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
is to vote on the one independent
 
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:10.710 align:start position:0%
is to vote on the one independent
section

02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
that represents moving 254
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
over into hb2 go ahead and vote on that
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
now and then if that's
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
done then the then the decision to maybe
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
retain hb
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
254 gets to be clear if we took those
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
two steps today
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
and then we deferred the rest of this
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
work to what mr ripple suggested
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
i i think we'd have more locked down
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
this would be that's amendment 0.937
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
09

02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
what we had for the first part i thought
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
was 0.926
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're right i'm sorry it's 0.926 all
 
02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:04.469 align:start position:0%
you're right i'm sorry it's 0.926 all
right

02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
you want to pull it up just so again
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it
 
02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:19.310 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it
yes

02:22:19.310 --> 02:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
so so if you would scroll down i'd i'd
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
be willing to make a motion that we
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh accept amendment zero nine
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
two six i just wanna verify that this is
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's enough um okay so representative
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
edwards moves
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment zero nine two six is there a
 
02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:49.670 align:start position:0%
amendment zero nine two six is there a
second

02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%

02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none call a role for adopting
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh amendment 0926 to hb2
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%

02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%

02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
and at all for taking lead on that um
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
but so mr ripple okay
 
02:24:07.270 --> 02:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
if there it felt to me like you had a
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
lot of notes
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe a couple of them might be a
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
little confusing
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
does it is does it feel to you like you
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
really need
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
all morning and maybe even some
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon to
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
to get ols working on it is it is it
 
02:24:22.319 --> 02:24:22.950 align:start position:0%
to get ols working on it is it is it
possible

02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
possible to come back tomorrow with it
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think you could i think you could come
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
back tomorrow um if i got a little
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on a couple of the items
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
today okay can i float another idea
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
could could we like
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
vote out of an hb2 placeholder
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
and and put it in there to where
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
we could work for several days without
 
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:52.230 align:start position:0%
we could work for several days without
worrying

02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
worrying
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
that we get this language exactly the
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
way we want
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
and then the placeholder if it gets
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
sucked in and over to
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
senate the senate then we would have
 
02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
independent separate language to hand
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting incorporating
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's been discussed today as is but
 
02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
what's been discussed today as is but
working

02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
at some later date to come up with
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
revised language
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
that that seems like an option to
 
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:26.469 align:start position:0%
that that seems like an option to
consider

02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
just because i i do want to be able to
 
02:25:29.359 --> 02:25:30.309 align:start position:0%
just because i i do want to be able to
declare

02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
declare
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're done at some point and i don't
 
02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:33.349 align:start position:0%
we're done at some point and i don't
want

02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that we need to declare
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves as being done
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
to pressure us to making you know
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
an ill-fought-out decision
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking for alternatives to buy
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
us a little time without
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
killing our deadline representative
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
wallner do you
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea there yeah i mean
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've got 254
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
has passed okay so that the first part
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
then the next part i think it's we've
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
just got a few
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
um just a few changes i don't think it's
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
really i don't think it's like we have
 
02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:14.230 align:start position:0%
really i don't think it's like we have
rewritten

02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
rewritten
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
the whole the whole rsa i mean i don't
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
think we've
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
rewritten the whole statute here i think
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've i think we've just got a few
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
changes and it seems like coming back
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning i think ols
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
could probably get this ready for us
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
um i certainly wouldn't i mean i think
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
a position when we get over to the
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
senate we can be flexible i mean
 
02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
senate we can be flexible i mean
obviously

02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
the senate is going to get a lot more
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
information people are going to come in
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
people are going to like it people
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
aren't going to like it people
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
want to be on the commission people went
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
off the commission i mean you know
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
our emails are filled tonight but
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think we should we need something and
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think we did the work this afternoon
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that's just my suggestion i i love
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
your suggestion
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll put away my concern
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that mr ripple can work with ols
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
on the remaining pieces to clean it up
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then uh so but
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
because ols will need the morning
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
we we probably need to get back together
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
does do people have conflicts or do they
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
have uh the
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
their afternoons free because if their
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
afternoons are free i'd like to
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know go ahead and we have to call
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
the meeting in the session at 9 30 and
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
then we can recess to one
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
or something like that if no one has a
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
schedule conflict
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i had warning in morning conflicts
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
at uh eight o'clock with the governor
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
9 15 probably with the
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
speaker so
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
how about one o'clock is one is the
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon clear for you sir it is it is
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren well i was just
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
kevin how long it would take
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
it this foreign not sure it would take
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
that long
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
i guess thank you yeah i don't think it
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
would take that long i think if you
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to meet at 9 30 tomorrow we would
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
have everything ready by then easily
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
if there are other reasons to not meet
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
in the morning like scheduled conflicts
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's another story but we could have
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
it by 9 30.
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to start this
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
meeting at 9
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
30. that that's what's in the calendar
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
we'll start it at 9 30 if ols can
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
support us that quick
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
great we'll knock it out if they if ols
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
isn't ready
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to recess until a
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable time in the afternoon
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i've got this
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
207 i'm not sure what that is 915 and
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
207 but
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'll find out when i get there maybe
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'll be there by 9 30.
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'll be up and conquered on my computer
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and really the only thing i needed
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
clarification on was i wasn't sure there
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
was any resolution about taking out
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
waypoint by name or the disabilities
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
rights center by name
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
i think representative weiler made a
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
convincing case to leave him in
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
because they're leaning forward in the
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
well those will be taken care of when um
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 was strung together so
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
they'll reference the appropriate
 
02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:44.630 align:start position:0%
they'll reference the appropriate
sections

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
sections
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so in that way
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
point area mr ripple would
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
never mind i'm going to leave that wrong
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
well great so we've had we have a game
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
plan you're going to try to get it
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
cleaned up
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
get it through ols we'll meet at 9 30 if
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's ready we can talk about it
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
and then if it's not we can recess for
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that's needed
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren so
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate a full vote on the
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
budget we've prepared tomorrow or what's
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
the end game for finishing our work
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
well as i i think the uh
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
the last thing that we really need to
 
02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
vote on is hb
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
254 as as uh i talked to mr ripple
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
we we don't need to vote on an entire
 
02:30:41.359 --> 02:30:42.309 align:start position:0%
we we don't need to vote on an entire
budget

02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
because with all the components that we
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
have voted on
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
he can piece it together and that's and
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's what our budget proposal is
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
did i hear you right mr ripple that's
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
correct you voted on all the individual
 
02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
correct you voted on all the individual
components

02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
components
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the sununu center
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
and with with the exception of the house
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill one side of the sununu center which
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
why don't you bring up house bill one
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
now my understanding was that along with
 
02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:40.309 align:start position:0%
now my understanding was that along with
the

02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
closure of the sununu center and the
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
adoption of the house bill 2 amendments
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
you would also be zeroing out the budget
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
for this nunu center in 23
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
so move
 
02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
so move
second

02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh not seeing any further discussion uh
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair would you or mr clerk would you
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
call a roll
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative earth yes representative
 
02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
weiler votes yes representative bean
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative walner yes
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative nordroom
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative rogers
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards yes
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
mr chair of the voter 7-0 all right
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
so i think we're ready to uh take up hb
 
02:32:44.319 --> 02:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
so i think we're ready to uh take up hb
254

02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
um and given what we just did with house
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
i i think the uh the idea here is that
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
we probably ought to retain 254
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that we have a vehicle to react with
 
02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:06.220 align:start position:0%
later should we need one um
 
02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
later should we need one um
[Music]

02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay so um with that i would accept
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain house bill 254
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
in finance you have a question mr german

uh with the clerk call a roll on the
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 254
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative earth yes representative
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
weiler votes yes representative bean
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes

representative edwards yes
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay good okay
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
so other than the sununu center house
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're done is that right mr ripple
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct so everyone on the
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
committee recheck your notes
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
because i a couple times i thought i had
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
a complete list and people have
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh shaken me and corrected me so
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
didn't you say you were doing something
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
with representative uh rogers
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
oh i i am i'm just i'm just trying to
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
tie this up okay so
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner did you have
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
yes i just wondered if i could ask kevin
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
um to remind me what kind of documents
 
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.110 align:start position:0%
um to remind me what kind of documents
will

02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
the division be getting and when when do
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
you think we might be able to get them
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
about all of our decisions what
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
the piece that we will probably take to
 
02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:19.590 align:start position:0%
the piece that we will probably take to
finance

02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
well as usual um full finance exec
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
session the chair of each division will
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
be presenting two things what we call
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
the detailed change sheet
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
showing all of the differences between
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget and
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the division's recommended budget
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
in house bill and then also a packet of
 
02:35:41.359 --> 02:35:41.910 align:start position:0%
in house bill and then also a packet of
house

02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill 2 amendments that typically is
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
provided to the chair
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
in advance so they can work their way
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
through those documents and get ready
 
02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
for the presentation
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the full committee
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
typically receives it before the day of
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
the exec
 
02:35:55.439 --> 02:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
the exec
though

02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
so go ahead follow up
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
did you have one representative norgren
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't be able to receive the
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
documents and copy them
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
and have them in front of us as we
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
listen to the presentations
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
from each division they would be
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
available the day of the exec session
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't is the question will you get
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
hard copies
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um i'm not sure
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay are we talking about basically two
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
sheets of paper though
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about closets we're
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of paper
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
the detail change sheet is typically at
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
least a couple of pages long
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the house bill 2 amendment packet
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
will contain
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
the 10 or so amendments that you passed
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
previously as well as the
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
sununu center amendments
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
plus all the other divisions when we get
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
together with them
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes everything for the other divisions
 
02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
yes everything for the other divisions
too

02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
so and that's the standard way of
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
working historically
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative wallner
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
i i i guess this is the request of you
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
i wondered if um what kevin just said
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
was that you will receive
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
a detailed change report
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
before we go into the exec session
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you would be
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
willing to share it with
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the other members of the division so
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we have it in front of us
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
as we're and and maybe have it
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
in front of us a night before so we can
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
kind of re
 
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
remember what all the all the things
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
that we did
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
right and that's obviously a chairman's
 
02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.030 align:start position:0%
right and that's obviously a chairman's
decision

02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
i i i would like to to say that um
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
by now i i hope you think that i'm
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
fairly transparent and i want to get the
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
information out earlier rather than
 
02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
information out earlier rather than
later

02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
and i saw my i'm predisposed to doing
 
02:38:06.479 --> 02:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
and i saw my i'm predisposed to doing
that

02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a historical reason that seems
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
to not be
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the way it's done so i'd like to learn
 
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:14.389 align:start position:0%
the way it's done so i'd like to learn
why

02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
that is so that i know what decision i'm
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
making but
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm generally predisposed to sharing
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
what i know
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
so will you take that as an answer for
 
02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:26.070 align:start position:0%
so will you take that as an answer for
now

02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes i and to tell you the truth i didn't
 
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
even remember that we
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
didn't share them in the past
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
but only that that only the chair of the
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
division had it
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
i i didn't realize that representative
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
wilder's waving
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes sir generally we'll get you know
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
however many pages will be like
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
a paragraph or two janet will prepare
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be division one glove of about
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
division two bubbles
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
it'll show the vote from the division
 
02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation from the division
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it'll have
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know a paragraph of what each
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment's about
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
so generally that's what everybody sees
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know if you need more detail it's up
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
to what the chairman wants to provide
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
you but
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
generally that's what we all see
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
especially because it's going to be a
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
huge stack
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so it'll it'll still go on for three
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
or four pages with the number of
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
amendments we've got in each division so
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
three or four pages with a paragraph
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
probably for each what each
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendment's about i think janet does
 
02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
amendment's about i think janet does
that

02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah we'll still get that
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right so i think we can
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
go to the next topic um representative
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
rogers put a lot of work
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
into preparing to talk to us about her
 
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:53.429 align:start position:0%
into preparing to talk to us about her
hb1

02:39:53.429 --> 02:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
proposal related to family planning
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
and um i i
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to offer her an opportunity
 
02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:03.670 align:start position:0%
i would like to offer her an opportunity
to

02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
share with us what she
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
has come to want to propose
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
as i said to you earlier in an email i
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
think we've moved on from there
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me how you and the
 
02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
majority of the division feels about
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
this so i don't want to waste anyone's
 
02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.110 align:start position:0%
this so i don't want to waste anyone's
time

02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
all right it's your it's your call
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
on whether you present your proposal or
 
02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
on whether you present your proposal or
not

02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i would just say that
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
our feelings don't matter in this case
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's the proper polite thing to do to
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
give you an
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present all the work that
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
you did
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i i'm i'm prepared to listen to what
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
you had to say
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
um but it like i said it's your choice
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
and uh i want to i want you to know that
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
whatever your choice is we support it
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm not prone to be a kamikaze for no
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
reason i know how the vote will turn out
 
02:41:03.910 --> 02:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's my choice to waste
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
my time nor yours
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
all right well um so with that
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
are there any final comments for the
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
good of the committee
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i think uh what we're ready to
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
go into adjournment until 9 30 tomorrow
 
02:41:23.359 --> 02:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
go into adjournment until 9 30 tomorrow
morning

02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the game plan that if we can uh
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
work through
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
the changes to the hb2 around the sununu
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
center we'll
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
we'll knock it out starting at 9 30
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
and if not we'll reschedule to the
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon to buy time for ols
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
so uh with that uh we're in adjournment
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
