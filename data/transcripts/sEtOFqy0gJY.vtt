00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
to three million yes yeah so
 

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.810 align:start position:0%

I<00:20:24.419><c> think</c><00:20:24.780><c> you</c><00:20:25.140><c> could</c><00:20:25.320><c> probably</c><00:20:25.559><c> squeeze</c><00:20:26.520><c> a</c><00:20:26.640><c> few</c>

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:22.850 align:start position:0%
um but this this doesn't do that that's
