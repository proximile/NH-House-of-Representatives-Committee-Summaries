00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
the um you you folks are at the
 
00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.589 align:start position:0%
the um you you folks are at the
subcommittee

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
um hearing for
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
um HB 232 which is
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
um addressing private sector
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um OSHA standards and
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
um at this point
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
um what we are looking to do is adopt
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards without necessarily
 
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.790 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards without necessarily
going

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 align:start position:0%
um full out for a state plan
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
and we had a study committee
 
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.890 align:start position:0%
and we had a study committee
um

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.210 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
when a year ago
 
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
and that study committee
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
got shortened up substantially more than
 
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
we would have liked and so the committee
 
00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 align:start position:0%
chose to retain the bill so that we
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
could get more input from
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um the the stakeholders so um that's why
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
we are here and I'm looking out I'm
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
seeing stakeholders so that's uh that's
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
a good thing
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and essentially what uh by adopting
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
the um uh the OSHA standards what we're
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting we want to do is to adopt the
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
1910 standards and those are the general
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
um uh the general standards there's two
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
other categories but we felt this was
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate one it is a
 
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 align:start position:0%
substantial list of Standards
 
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.210 align:start position:0%
substantial list of Standards
[Music]

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
we've got Wes from the Department here
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we've got him to thank for doing a
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison of the OSHA
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
standards in the department of labor
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
standards and um
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
what um that is available to folks
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
um the the comparison it is a fairly
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
large file
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
um it's not something you're going to
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
want to print out unless you've got a
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
lot of paper
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
um but uh essentially
 
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I've forwarded it to Kristen and
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
um who is the committee committee
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
assistant and
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
um she would be happy to send it out to
 
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
um she would be happy to send it out to
anybody

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
um who would like to have a copy of it I
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
also have it so if you want to contact
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
me Brian Sullivan representative Brian
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I'd be happy to send it out as
 
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.350 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I'd be happy to send it out as
well

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
but there are I think you will find that
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of standards that don't
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
um the uh the various employers so you
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
can find the standards that are most
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
applicable to whatever type of
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
employment you're involved with
 
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.090 align:start position:0%
employment you're involved with
um

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
so with that I would be happy to open it
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
up to folks who would like to weigh in
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
on um if you've got questions if you've
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
got concerns if you've got suggestions
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
um we're uh we're here to listen so
 
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.969 align:start position:0%
um we're uh we're here to listen so
um

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
anybody out there want to
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
if you could introduce yourself as you
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Susie Nord and I work for
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
the National Council for occupational
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
safety and health and I was going to
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
wait for other people because I feel
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
like I have had the opportunity to
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
address the committee about why National
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
Kosh supports I was spelled 232 and has
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
in fact been working towards
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
helping the state of New Hampshire adopt
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
a public sector OSHA plan and I feel
 
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
like this is a good next step in that
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
but where nobody else decided to come up
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
I thought I would just tell you I've
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
been doing a little research which I
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
said that I would do at the last time I
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
was in a hearing to address some of the
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions I'd heard and I wanted to let
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know what had come of that
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that
 
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
people were most concerned about was how
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards which are mostly for
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
private sector interact with public
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
services such as police and fire
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
um which don't necessarily seem like
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
they're a good fit and I found a number
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
of things first of all nobody I I should
 
00:08:59.810 --> 00:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit my organization
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
um has a list served for health and
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
safety Professionals of about 2 000
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
people across the country who work in
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety occupational
 
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.290 align:start position:0%
health and safety occupational
health

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:11.300 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500 align:start position:0%
professionals such as doctors lawyers
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienists people who are on
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
health and safety committees in
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
workplaces and also many workers as well
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
who are involved in health and safety in
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
their own organizations so I put the
 
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
question out how does a public sector
 
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:35.420 align:start position:0%
OSHA plan interact specifically with
 
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:38.420 align:start position:0%
fire safety or police
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I heard from a number of people
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
including one person who was actually
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
recently retired from the Washington
 
00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:47.630 align:start position:0%
recently retired from the Washington
State

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
OSHA plan so this is a person who has
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um in the state of Washington they have
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
a public sector OSHA plan and she was
 
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.070 align:start position:0%
a public sector OSHA plan and she was
um

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:03.260 align:start position:0%
one of the people who administered it
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
and she basically said that they never
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
had any problems with dealing with
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
um fire and police specifically because
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
they worked very closely with the um
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
fire and police departments to adopt
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
sort of the national standards and
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
there's acronyms that I won't bore you
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
with but mostly because I can't remember
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
them that
 
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.009 align:start position:0%
them that
um

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
are actually more
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
um protective than what is in the 1910
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
standards and so I don't think that any
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
of that as long as we're following
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
national standards for protecting our
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
fire and police officers should be a
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
problem because they're probably already
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
doing more than these would require
 
00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.490 align:start position:0%
doing more than these would require
anyway

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I she did give me a couple of
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
interesting examples I'll tell you about
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
one of them that um they worked with
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
their state police about lead
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
at the firing range because apparently
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
there was um concerns about the amount
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
of lead from when they fire the bullets
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
apparently bullets have led I
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
am not a gun person so I don't know but
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
um so that was something that having the
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
the they call it Dosh there it's the
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
department of Occupational Health in
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
Washington Dash or wadosh and that was
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
something that they worked on that
 
00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:34.339 align:start position:0%
wasn't covered by
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
existing police standards but that you
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
know that it was a a benefit that having
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
the the public sector OSHA added for
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
I guess the other thing that I really
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
want to highlight is that I've spoken to
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
people who work with some of the public
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
sector employers since
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
the original hearings on this bill and I
 
00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:07.579 align:start position:0%
think there's a misunder or
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization that this is
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
creating new
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
things for public sector employers to
 
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.530 align:start position:0%
things for public sector employers to
actually

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
have to comply with because
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
um my reading an understanding is that
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor the New
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor has
 
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.690 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor has
um

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
an understanding that public sector
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
employers will keep their workers safe
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
and that they are charged with ensuring
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
that this happens and so they do
 
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:41.579 align:start position:0%
inspections and go out and this is
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
nothing new the only thing new is that a
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
few years ago it was put into statute
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
instead of just being in rules and
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's a number for the rules and I
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
don't know that either
 
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:52.970 align:start position:0%
don't know that either
um

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
and that my understanding from the
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
former Deputy Commissioner Rudy Ogden
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards that we're looking to
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
incorporate into
 
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.329 align:start position:0%
incorporate into
um

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
House Bill 232 are one of the places
 
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:10.220 align:start position:0%
that they look when the New Hampshire
 
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:13.220 align:start position:0%
standards are silent
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
because it gives them sort of a
 
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.810 align:start position:0%
because it gives them sort of a
meaningful

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:19.820 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
guideline or guidance for the employers
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
and so the idea my understanding from
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
the the study committee last year and
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
the reason that this study committee
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported the concept of
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
what house bill 232 does is that most
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
public sector employers didn't
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that this was one of
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
the places that the Department of Labor
 
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.500 align:start position:0%
inspectors were going for
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
guidance when doing their inspections
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee or the study committee
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
last year believed that this bill
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
was basically not requiring anything
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
specifically new it was saying
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
let's make public the standards that
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
people are being held to currently
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
so without and I'll take any questions
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
but those are the two points that I
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
really have sort of been thinking about
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
this summer and really feel like in my
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
discussions with people those are two
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
points of clarity I felt needed to be
 
00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:23.949 align:start position:0%
points of clarity I felt needed to be
made

00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
perhaps if
 
00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:40.459 align:start position:0%
the department is willing to
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
Enlighten us further on the general
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
duties clause and how that interacts
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
with the department of labor standards
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
and any other standards including the
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards yes of course
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
um Wesley Gardner attorney for the New
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor so um as
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
we just testified to we do have the
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
general duties Clause that kind of fills
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
in the gaps where we don't have specific
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
safety standards and again to clarify
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
our safety inspectors do look to OSHA
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
1910 1926 and 1928 where applicable and
 
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
again it is for guidance though I think
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
the key point of Distinction here is if
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
the committee and the legislature were
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
to adopt this it does become law and
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's no longer simply guidance but yes I
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
can clarify and confirm that what our
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors do when they see a gap
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
in our specific safety standards they
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
will look to the OSHA standards as well
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
as other national standards just to see
 
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.949 align:start position:0%
as other national standards just to see
um

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
what might be appropriate in certain
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
specific situations
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
can you um
 
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.290 align:start position:0%
can you um
clarify

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
when the DOL standards have last been
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
so of course you know it depends on each
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
specific statute from what I can tell
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
the last update was 2019 for any of the
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 277 standards
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
um but again some of them have not been
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
updated since um you know the 1980s or
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
I've seen seem to recall that Deputy
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden indicated that the
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
for the most part hadn't really been
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
updated since he's been with the
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
Department which was I think 10 years or
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
more yes that is correct I do remember
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Ogden testifying to
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
that again there's been a handful of the
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
RSA 277 Provisions that have been
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
updated but by and large many of the
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
provisions have not been updated in some
 
00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:50.210 align:start position:0%
provisions have not been updated in some
time

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
and would you agree that one of the
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
advantages might be that OSHA standards
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
are continuously being updated and would
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the 1910 standards they
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
um updated regularly and automatically
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
adopted yes as I understand it it's an
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
annual thing that the OSHA standards are
 
00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.730 align:start position:0%
annual thing that the OSHA standards are
updated

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
um they're they're constantly being
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
updated I can tell you that the
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
department myself and Deputy
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden met with Joe Larose
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
who's the field supervisor for OSHA
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
um at the federal level and he did state
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
that they are constantly being updated
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis so that is something
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that um the department as well as uh all
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders would have to be
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
mindful of that this is a constant
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
rolling update
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
um in the standards that are being
 
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.630 align:start position:0%
um in the standards that are being
implemented

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
is the department able to assist
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
employers public sector Employers in um
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track of those updates
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
I would say the department is able to
 
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
however the caveat being that uh current
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
state we have two safety inspectors with
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
a third position open
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
um obviously the three safety inspector
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
positions were intended to implement uh
 
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
chapter 277 as currently written and as
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
our safety standards are currently
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
written so it's inevitable that there
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
will probably be a lot more interest
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders in trying to comply
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
with the new standards so we do have
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
minimal capacity as it relates to
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
implementation of these laws in the
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
sense that we would expect that a lot of
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
stakeholders will have a lot of
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions that want consultancies to
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
determine if they are in compliance so
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
to your specific question yes I do
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
believe that the department can assist
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
employers however again the capacity at
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
current state is rather minimal again
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
given that our three safety inspector
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
positions were intended to support
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
chapter 277 as it's currently written
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
I seem to recall that uh Deputy
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission commissioner Ogden had
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
indicated that along with the adoption
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
of 232 the department would like likely
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
hire additional Personnel do are you
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
familiar with that yes I am familiar
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
with that and if I call correctly from
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the committee last year Deputy
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden and testified he
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
believed that we would need
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
approximately six new positions
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
um I believe there would be one safety
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
manager position
 
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:09.860 align:start position:0%
three inspector positions
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
one clerical position
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
and two consultant positions if I
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
can you indicate how that would impact
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would impact the
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
general fund in the sense of the
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor historically does
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
not take from the general fund rather
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
over the last few years we've given to
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund however of course any
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
new positions would you know cost more
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
money at the end of the day but it
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
should not have any impact on the
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
general fund specifically to my
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
knowledge yeah I was surprised to learn
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
sorry absent the the give back that the
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
department does would inevitably be
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
lower of course but I was surprised to
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
learn that the department doesn't use
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
and also I think Deputy Commissioner
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
Ogden indicated that due to
 
00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.330 align:start position:0%
Ogden indicated that due to
um

00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.330 align:start position:0%
um
a

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
more

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
a a bigger effort on part of on part of
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
the Department of collecting I think fee
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
fees and and such they had gone from
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
having a million dollars that they sent
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
back to more like two or three is I
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
believe the number this year was closer
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
to three million yes yeah so
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
I think you could probably squeeze a few
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
additional employees out of three
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
million dollars potentially again caveat
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
just being that that's less that goes to
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
the general fund from the Department
 
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.909 align:start position:0%
the general fund from the Department
right

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you thank you Mr
 
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you thank you Mr
Gardner

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the floor is open to other
 
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.650 align:start position:0%
the floor is open to other
um

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
Miss Horgan anything on behalf of the
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:16.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan Kate
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
Horgan from the New Hampshire
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
Association of counties I will actually
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
have five people here next week to
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
address the committee several HR
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
managers uh won the correction
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
superintendents and one of our nursing
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
home administrators who can more
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
accurately address any questions you
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
guys all have um so I would defer if you
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
are willing to let me to defer until
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
next week when I have my subject matter
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
experts here that would be great I think
 
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:43.660 align:start position:0%
you should do it all right now
 
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.430 align:start position:0%
you should do it all right now
[Laughter]

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you that's that's good to
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
anything from the Department of
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
yep please
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit embarrassing for me to
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
ask but can you please refresh my memory
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
of why we're going the route of
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
going the OSHA 1910 standards rather
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
than looking at updating our current
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
safety standards that we have under
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think well the initial effort was to
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
create a state plan which would have um
 
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.570 align:start position:0%
create a state plan which would have um
basically

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.230 align:start position:0%
basically
um

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
brought the public sector employees
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
under OSHA um it was a fairly involved
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
process the subcommittee or the study
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh chose to adopt just the
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards rather than
 
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:13.580 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
rather than going for the state plan
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
because it's a more streamlined process
 
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
because it's a more streamlined process
um

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
and I frankly we what by adopting the
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards we save a lot of time and
 
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:27.620 align:start position:0%
effort on on the part of the department
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
and obviously the department hasn't been
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
updating its standards and this would be
 
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:36.260 align:start position:0%
a a sweeping update
 
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.810 align:start position:0%
a a sweeping update
and

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:37.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
basically I I think the study committee
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
felt that a change was in order the
 
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:46.580 align:start position:0%
failure to update
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
over the last many years is something
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
that needed to be addressed and we felt
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
the best way to address it was to Simply
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
and and I think the the other the other
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
piece of it is is already been stated
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
but I think it's worth restating the
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
department uses a general duties Clause
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly when
 
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.950 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly when
um addressing

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
um addressing
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
um safety issues
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and um and there are lots of gaps I
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
mean if if one were to review the uh
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison it does identify
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that OSHA covers that
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
the department of labor standards does
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
not but when an unsafe situation is
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
identified where there's a gap in the
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
department of labor standards they turn
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
to OSHA
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
um the problem is that um if some If an
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
employer or employee group is reviewing
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
the department of labor standards they
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know that the general duties
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
Clause is going to cause
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
the department to look look to the OSHA
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
standard so if if they're already using
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards in various circumstances
 
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.890 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards in various circumstances
it's

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for people to know that if
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
you want to really see the standards
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
look to the 1910 standards and that will
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
you may
 
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.250 align:start position:0%
you may
um

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
on that topic I think it's important
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the work of this committee
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
characterize that we we heard some
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
General discussion before and you kind
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
of reiterated that that some of the
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost isn't really cost
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
because today we expect all the
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
employers to have a safe environment for
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
their workers and and that's not going
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
to change but as this advances to the
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
larger bodies and goes across the wall I
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
think it's you and I and and many of us
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
here have been working on this for years
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
and years and we understand that all
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
that background but I think it's going
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
to be important to characterize that in
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
a way that everyone can evaluate that
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
and when a town or a county says whoa
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
this is downshifting costs from the
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
state to us and our tax base that we
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
know how to
 
00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
know how to
um

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
explain that in in terms of hard facts
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope I I appreciate that that
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
you'll want to have
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
um experts come and and help explain
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
that to us rather than summarize to it
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
so I hope that in the next meeting that
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh come to some kind of understanding
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
that then this committee can use to
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
explain to the the legislature at Large
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
why we think this is the right idea
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
I may
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
um can we go back to Mr Garner if I have
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
your name correctly
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and just get a little bit more
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
information I'm a little curious about
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
the the Labor Statistics with what we
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
currently have we have two inspectors
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
with one empty position to be filled but
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
if we adopt OSHA 1910 standards then we
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
need to fill six positions why would
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
there be a disparity between what we're
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
doing today in our safety program versus
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
my apologies thank you for the question
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
represent so one of the key distinctions
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
um one is the consultancy program OSHA
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
does require a consultancy program that
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire doesn't
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
um so again we would need a couple of
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
Consultants that they basically
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
um go out to the employers and they kind
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
of review what they have for safety
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
standards their safety plans and they go
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
over them and tell them how they might
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
come into compliance again it's wide
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
sweeping regulation so that's this
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
assistance is necessary the other piece
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
of it as well too is given the wide
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
sweeping nature of it we would just
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
simply need more inspectors
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
um you know as the committee is probably
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
aware and has been testified to the 277
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
standards a relatively minimal in
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
comparison to the OSHA standards and
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
there also needs to be more subject
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
matter expertise I would say as well too
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why we would need more um and
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
again the clear another point of
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
clarification as well is when Deputy
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden testified to that
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
last year that was very specific to the
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
state plan implementation which is not
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
merely just the 1910s so I would say we
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
don't need all six positions where we to
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
adopt the 1910s but in going towards the
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
state plan that was the intention for
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
what Deputy Commissioner Ogden stated as
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
the expansion and it to be clear this
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
bill does not create a state plan
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct this this bill just adopts the
 
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:12.740 align:start position:0%
standards if we were to adopt um this or
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
create a state plan that would be
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
something down the road who would
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
require additional legislation and um
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
but at this point the the study
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
committee was comfortable with uh and
 
00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:25.909 align:start position:0%
committee was comfortable with uh and
frankly

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
um the States of Maine and
 
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.409 align:start position:0%
um the States of Maine and
Massachusetts

00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:32.419 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
have both just adopted State plans but
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
prior to adopting the state plans they
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
adopted the OSHA of safety standards so
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
um it seems like it worked effectively
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
for for them we would not ever
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to adopt a state plan I
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
can see
 
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:55.940 align:start position:0%
legislatures in the future
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
wanting to consider that because Federal
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
money comes along with the state plan
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
but for now
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
um it as has been said this is a good
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
Next Step getting the standards in and
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
then down the road if we so choose we
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
could adopt the
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh or create a state plan
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
um but this this doesn't do that that's
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
correct and so possibly all six of those
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
positions would not be needed at this
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
time that's correct again the point of
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarity is that when Deputy Commissioner
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Ogden testified to the
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
um guess of six additional employees for
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
the Department that was based on the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
state plan but again uh the department
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
is able to implement this but we will be
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
stretched thin with the two current
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors and again the big
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
piece of it is the consultancy program
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
that we do not currently have the safety
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
inspectors do go they help evaluate
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
employers plans their safety rules and
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
get them into compliance but it's not a
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
full consultancy program by any means
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
and but the
 
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
and but the
um

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
HB 232 does to my knowledge does not
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
create a consultancy program that is
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
correct however we anticipate that many
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
of these stakeholders will reach out to
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
the department in essence looking for a
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
consultancy to ensure that they're in
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
compliance before they get a com the
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
department gets a complaint an inspector
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
has to go out there and cite them for
 
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
violations yeah we expect them to be
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
proactive great yep
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
and I believe you mentioned an admin
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
position as well what would the need for
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
the additional administrative position
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
be that you don't have today so I'm
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
assuming you're speaking of like the
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
safety manager position the Deputy
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Deputy Commissioner Ogden
 
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:40.330 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Deputy Commissioner Ogden
identified

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:40.340 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
or or a clerical position yeah it's it's
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
just the fact of having multiple more
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
several more inspectors the consultancy
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
program and just having uh admin
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
position to support that
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
but that's all it is and the consultancy
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
program if I'm understanding correctly
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like it's going to be a
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
permanent long-term position it sounds
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
more like it would be a short term so
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
the consultancy program is a piece of
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
the OSHA state plan as I understand it
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
that is required to have and maintain a
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
state plan and receive federal funding
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
so if the intent were to eventually go
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
to a state plan of course that would
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
have to be in place
 
00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:19.490 align:start position:0%
have to be in place
um

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
more than likely it's hard to say though
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
overall of what the volume of
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholder reach out would be and
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
whether it would be just an initial one
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
to two year thing where this new um new
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
legislation is in place so it is hard to
 
00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:35.930 align:start position:0%
legislation is in place so it is hard to
say

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
um but I do know
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
at least again for the ocean state plan
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
and OSHA regulations in general the
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
consultancy program is a very key piece
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
of that because a lot of employers again
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
are proactive in reaching out to
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
determine if they are in compliance
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
before God forbid an accident happens or
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
a complaint comes in and the inspector
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
Federal funding looks like what is it
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for for this Federal
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
funding so as I understand it the
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
federal funding what happens is when a
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
state implements a state OSHA plan
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
they've been working usually for years
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
with Federal OSHA if Federal OSHA
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
approves the state plan and finds that
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
the standards are either the same or as
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
at least as effective then the state can
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
apply to the federal government and as I
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
understand it does have to be an
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
application it's not automatic the state
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
can apply to the federal government for
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
up to 50 percent of federal funding and
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
as I understand it it's at the
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
discretion of the federal government of
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
how much funding it is again it goes up
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
to 50 percent it can be anything lower
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent though and there's no
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee for federal funds and in light
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
of that as well too the state does have
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
to keep a rolling update to make sure
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
that they're in compliance with Federal
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards and that the standards
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
are at least as effective to maintain
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
getting receipt of that Federal funding
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
and what are some of the things that we
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
would be using these Federal funding for
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
is it for buying equipment or is it for
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing it would be for Staffing and
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the positions by and large
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes um as I as I understand it the
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
department wouldn't need any more
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
equipment I don't believe maybe State
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
cards is the only thing I can really
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
think of generally
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but there's there's no other
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
equipment that I can think of off the
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
top of my head that we would need so the
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
funding would be for State positions and
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
just implementing the plan in general
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
and as I understand it when you say 50
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
percent it's 50 percent of the entire
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
public sector safety program that is how
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
I understand it as well yes
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
are we receiving any federal funds now
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
if I could I just want to make it clear
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the proposal on the table in front
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
of us comes with no federal fund we
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible that
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
for that there's nothing in here that
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
says we would work towards that
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
eligibility or submit that application
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
um we did in the first version of this
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
Bill if you will to come through the
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislature that was the proposal and
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's why many of us are at least
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
passingly familiar with what the
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
over the years this committee has
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
decided not to go that route and we
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
could get into the details
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
um let's just not to be controversial
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
say there were questions whether that
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
would be a net gain or a net cost
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
because that funding also comes with
 
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
because that funding also comes with
requirements

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
would it pay for their requirements and
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
then some would it pay for almost all
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
the requirements we we hadn't clarified
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
that number and this committee decided
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
to go a different route which was to
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
implement it all within
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
state law which then makes us ineligible
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
at least at this time to work through
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
that Federal program so discussions
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
about what federal money is available
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
and what it would pay for are for
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
something very different than what we're
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
considering and I think some of the
 
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.170 align:start position:0%
considering and I think some of the
other

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:32.180 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
attraction was done frankly
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily involve oship in New
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safety programs this would be
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor implementing
 
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:46.700 align:start position:0%
OSHA the OSHA standards without
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
the help or interference of federal
 
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
oship so it gets us enhanced standards
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
without having to jump through all the
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
various Hoops that OSHA would require
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
with the state plan I think that's why
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
the study committee was comfortable
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
going this route rather than the state
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
plan let's let's do it ourselves let's
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
adopt the standards and you know stick
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
with our department labor and and their
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
method of doing things because I think
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:19.089 align:start position:0%
one of the
um

00:37:19.089 --> 00:37:19.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
one of the nice Parts about our
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
department of labor is that it is not
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
overly punitive
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
issues with safety their objective is to
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
get it fixed not to punish
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's something that we
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we maintain and um
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
it it'll be more of a education process
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
than a wacky over the head process so um
 
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.870 align:start position:0%
than a wacky over the head process so um
I

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
I think that that was the attraction to
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I apologize I was
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
late coming in if you're just taking
 
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.910 align:start position:0%
late coming in if you're just taking
open

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh for the record Brian
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
Hawkins representing Nea New Hampshire
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
we represent uh K-12 employees in most
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state and so
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
obviously uh safety standards would have
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh an important impact for our members
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
um schools are first and foremost place
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
for places for students but there are
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
also places of employment and so we
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
would very much like to work with the
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
committee help the committee to the
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
extent they need information
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the benefits of being part of
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
an uh affiliate of a National
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
Organization is we also have the benefit
 
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.770 align:start position:0%
Organization is we also have the benefit
of

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know knowing what the experience is
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
like in other states for employees in
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
schools that either are an OSHA state or
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know have safety standards that are
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
comparable to OSHA and so
 
00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:27.230 align:start position:0%
comparable to OSHA and so
um

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
mainly want to say we're
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
eager to work with the committee and
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
um hope to attend all your sessions and
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
please let us know what information we
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
can help provide great and I would also
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you enhance safety
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
standards for the teachers you
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
inevitably enhance safety standards for
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
the students as well so they're all in
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the same boat so I think enhanced safety
