00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is jan schmidt
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i represent nashua award one and i'm
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
here to um ask you to pass hb 617 a tiny
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
tiny little bill
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
last year a constituent asked to ask me
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
to help her with children and allergies
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
to keep them safer so between ols and us
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
we wrote a huge bill which would sweep
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
all we wanted into one bill
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
the education committee loved it but the
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from school nurses told us
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
that they already do all of this
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh so much is uh done in rules and of
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
course that's an appropriate place for
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
requirements like i've got listed on the
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
sheet i sent you
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
so it went to interim study and i heard
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
this from one of the subcommittee
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
members it was pointed out that
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
200 colon 44a covers everything in the
 
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
200 colon 44a covers everything in the
bill

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
except daycare and that should go to
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services there you go
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
so here we have hb617
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
any person employed by and serving food
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
in a licensed child care center shall
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
pass a food safety class meeting the
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
standards of the conference of food
 
00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.470 align:start position:0%
standards of the conference of food
protection

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
now i have an allergy to peppers and one
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
bite of the seeds are the skin and
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
within hours i've got this volcano
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
brewing inside but i know what i need to
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
know to avoid this
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
with no nurse on site children in
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
daycare rely on those adults caring for
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
them to ensure their safety this small
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
change would mean a big difference in
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
the confidence we have in the folks who
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
care for our smallest neighbors so i ask
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
you find
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
hb 617 ought to pass and i'll answer any
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%

good morning representative schmidt good
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
morning neighbor hey how are you
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering does it specify how
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
many hours of training a
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
server would need to have
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
um i need to do more research on the
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
conference for
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
food protection but it's simply a safety
 
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
food protection but it's simply a safety
class

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds good we heard other
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
things about
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
hours of training for people who work
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
with people who have alzheimer's and you
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
know whatever and the hours of training
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
was kind of the issue so
 
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
was kind of the issue so
um

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%

my um
 
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
my um
question

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt um i've done
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
some work
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
matter of fact
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me i'm working with uh
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
on a variety of reforms of of child
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
day care centers and one of the issues
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
that we found in the study that we did
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
where we had over 60 people show up and
 
00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.629 align:start position:0%
where we had over 60 people show up and
testify

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
is that they're already required to have
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
18 ceus a year of training
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a huge burden especially on
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the smaller
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop style day care centers
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
that are out there so um i guess the
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
question is would this training
 
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
question is would this training
be

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
would would this
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
fill the requirement of the ceus and how
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
much does it cost the center to bring in
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
a course like this because it certainly
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
isn't free
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i think this this is
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
provided by the state
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think that you can take this class
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
i can do the research and find out for
 
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
i can do the research and find out for
you

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay we um
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yes follow-up thank you okay
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
we should probably talk about this um
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
we're having another study this time
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
with rebecca and i are doing a lot of
 
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
with rebecca and i are doing a lot of
work

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
on trying to
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
get a hold of of the um
 
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
get a hold of of the um
the

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
regulations on
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
child care centers we're losing for
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
every four that go under only one opens
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
and and it's a it's it's been made even
 
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:23.670 align:start position:0%
and and it's a it's it's been made even
worse

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
worse
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
in in this
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
time of coving so
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering if we could perhaps
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
maybe talk about this and try to fit it
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
all together because we have a piece of
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that's that's trying to cut
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
the amount of ceus down
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
to a more manageable level for these
 
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
to a more manageable level for these
centers

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think anytime we're talking about
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
regulations and making changes in them
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
the best thing obviously to do is look
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
at the whole picture
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and if some are outdated if some are
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
duplicated if some are missing this is
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
the perfect opportunity to make sure
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
that the whole thing is made whole
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent idea thank you very
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
much representative
representative

00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
because this is a follow-up to what we
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
i believe you told me 200 colon 41a
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
covers everything except
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
licensed child day care centers so the
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
question would be um
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
are they covered anywhere else in
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
statute and so therefore we are trying
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
to fill a gap or are they covered um we
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
just heard 18 hours
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
could you help me with that please as
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
far as as far as i know food safety for
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
children with allergies is not covered
 
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
children with allergies is not covered
anywhere

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.550 align:start position:0%
anywhere
okay

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
follow up to myself um had you
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
considered then making this a
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
everyone and not just licensed daycare
 
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.069 align:start position:0%
everyone and not just licensed daycare
centers

00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
um a requirement for someone who doesn't
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
go through a licensing procedure
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
might be very difficult to follow up on
 
00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
might be very difficult to follow up on
okay

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr sharon um
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
question about and thank you for taking
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
my question representative schmidt
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
who is this conference for food
 
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.110 align:start position:0%
who is this conference for food
protection

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
i asked that because
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
i just ran across this as chair of the
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp commission
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and who could provide certain services
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
turns out there was 436 credentialing
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
agencies in the u.s 136 of them in las
 
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.710 align:start position:0%
agencies in the u.s 136 of them in las
vegas

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
vegas
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
we were able to change that
 
00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.750 align:start position:0%
we were able to change that
to

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
just the american board of medical
 
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
just the american board of medical
specialties

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
specialties
 
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
specialties
um

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
to get uh have certain credentials
 
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
to get uh have certain credentials
what

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
what is the status of this conference
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
for food protection how do they gain
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
this prominence in our proposed
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh as as far as my research
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
has done it's it's a non-profit
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
organization that that's begun about 30
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
years ago and it's a formal process to
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
to follow food safety issues
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
if this is an inappropriate place to
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the class is done
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine as as i just said with uh
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative acton that if if
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that the allergy safety is
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
covered under any current law for day
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
cares this would
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly incredibly make a difference
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
for some of the families i've spoken
 
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
for some of the families i've spoken
with

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
follow up yes go ahead
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
um representative schmidt with after
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
this conference uh for food protection
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
has been completed is there any
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
um to to know whether this this has been
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
successful whether the education that
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
they get
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
is been
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
has done what it meant to accomplish uh
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
or is there no follow-up at all
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that there's no
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up on particularly on this and it
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
i would imagine per child care center or
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
per anyone who serves food to the
 
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:06.630 align:start position:0%
per anyone who serves food to the
children

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up would be every time
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
they have a new
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
um a new person working there they would
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt i am interested
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
in uh sort of maybe exploring some
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences one of the
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
um provisions of this bill sort of it
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
says anyone any person employed by and
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
serving food
 
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.990 align:start position:0%
serving food
it

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps sounds like a silly question but
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
is is there a definition around what it
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
what it means to serve food
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously if i'm
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
if i'm dishing out food onto a plate
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's serving food
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh if i'm handing out snacks to students
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
or to children in this case
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
then maybe i'm probably serving food if
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm handing them a
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
a meal or a snack that has been prepared
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
by a parent is that the same as serving
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
food so i guess my question is does this
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
become a de facto requirement that
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
everyone employed by the by the child
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
care center must uh must attend this
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
this class
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
but the bill itself does not
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
address that question
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
of definition
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative merchant
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.350 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
um

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
following up on the question about any
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.029 align:start position:0%
following up on the question about any
person

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
person
do

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
you expect all people to be
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
trained or having at least one person
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
within the facility trained so that
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
somebody there can recognize and deal
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
with it versus having everyone within
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
the facility of daycare being so trained
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that anybody who is
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
serving the children should have this
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
class anybody who is working there that
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
does not serve the children is not
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and i'm drawing upon that as far as
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
like in the school system the nurse is
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
the one trying to deal with these kind
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
of issues
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
however the people serving the food in
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria may also not have the
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
training i don't know if that's the case
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
or not just trying to look at the scope
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
of the requirement and trying to be
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
ensure that we balance it between
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the regulatory side of everyone versus
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
having someone there adequately trained
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
if if you look at what the school nurses
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
do presently within the rule not
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily within law but within the
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
rule that they must follow it's very
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
strict about what they're training and i
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
believe that anything that happens
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
within their purview has to be part of
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would say that yes
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
the people who create and serve meals to
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
children have to have
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
support and understanding of what
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing through the nurse
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is really interesting
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
because y'all are bringing up a lot of
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
really important ideas that need to be
 
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.950 align:start position:0%
really important ideas that need to be
clarified

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
um my i'm kind of interested in does
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
food safety how to handle food to keep
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
it safe
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
that also in this bill
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
the current rule
 
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.549 align:start position:0%
the current rule
covers

00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing allergies
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
are tracking allergies how to handle
 
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.669 align:start position:0%
are tracking allergies how to handle
allergies

00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
for schools yes it does um
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
i have something from the nurses last
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
i i tried this bill as i said earlier
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
encompassing everything
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
and found out that the nurses already
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
take care of everything that they manage
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
um and i did hear back from them with
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
the full list of what they do but if you
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
check the rules on on school nurses and
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
allergies you'll find that it is
 
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.029 align:start position:0%
allergies you'll find that it is
comprehensive

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
how do you find the rules to check
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's state rules on education and
 
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
uh there's state rules on education and
nursing

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's the state's rules on this
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am it would just be really nice
 
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am it would just be really nice
to

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
know where that is because
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh if you could email us the location
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's at 200 colon 44a
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
i believe i put that in the document i
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
i'm still asking really the same
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
question i mean the web page
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
to reach that because that's an rsa not
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
a rule
 
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.669 align:start position:0%
a rule
uh

00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
i can send that to you after i do the
 
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
i can send that to you after i do the
research

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking all of my
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely not a problem
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
to uh child care facilities have nurses
 
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.430 align:start position:0%
to uh child care facilities have nurses
normally

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
i do not believe so no
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay so that would not count on a
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
nurse being there to
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
help out on that my second question mr
 
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
help out on that my second question mr
chairman

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
as a former school teacher
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
while i never served lunch
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
i have been a principal and in an
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
elementary school and you do find
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
yourself sometimes
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
filling in and serving
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
under special circumstances handed the
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
kid to lunch or mom brings it in and you
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
bring it to them because they forgot it
 
00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
bring it to them because they forgot it
so

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
just curious about that
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'd ask your nurse if i were you i think
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's where um they they should make
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the entire school understands
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
the problems of food allergies and i
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
think at this point
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
almost all humans do understand how
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
deadly uh say a peanut allergy can be i
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
know that there's a the woman the
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine who actually asked
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
for this last year uh will be uh
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
speaking today she has some testimony
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
she has sent in i believe
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
and uh she has in-depth information on
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
this as her her child has suffering from
 
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.789 align:start position:0%
this as her her child has suffering from
allergies

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative snow please unmute and
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt for taking my
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
question i assume that all child care
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
centers require the parents to fill out
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
a health history and answer certain
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
questions is one of the questions on
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
those forms
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh does the child have any food
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
allergies and to ask for other details
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's part of the
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
regular record
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that any child care
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
center that does not require this would
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
find themselves in in courts very
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
quickly this this is simply a matter of
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
protecting the business and all the
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chairman um
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i wanted to better
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
understand the scope of the problem um
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm very aware of of the fact
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
that allergies can be
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh can be deadly in many cases and and
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
certainly are
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
a critical issue i guess i'm i'm trying
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
to what extent would this training
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
change the situation um you know if if
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
there if there's an awareness of that
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
already which i think has been pointed
 
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.230 align:start position:0%
already which i think has been pointed
out

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
out
um

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
does this really
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
does this really
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
change the situation or is it
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
essentially just telling people what
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
they what they already know in practice
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
every day that's that's uh that's my
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
concern is there any data on
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
sort of existing incidents and um
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
can you speak to how those might have
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
been um
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
avoided by uh by passing legislation
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to put it off but i
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
really think that my constituent has uh
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
the information that you're looking for
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
not my guessing but her knowing
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt so that i can
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
when it's time call on that constituent
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh what is your constituent's name
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
please oh you're going to ask me that
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%

merrimack new hampshire
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
formerly of nashua new hampshire as
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt had mentioned
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to thank the committee
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony here on hb 617
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
i've also emailed my written testimony
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee so please refer to that
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
for additional facts as well as some
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
data sources
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today because i have a two
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
and a half year old son with multiple
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
life-threatening food allergies and i
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
personally have experienced the severe
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
and life-threatening allergic reaction
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
known as anaphylaxis
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a working parent and i rely monday
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
through friday on child care and i've
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
found that the lack of food allergy and
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis training as well as food
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
allergy care plan implementation to be
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
extremely troubling to say the least
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
um when you have a child with a
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
life-threatening food allergy seemingly
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
benign things such as milk eggs peanuts
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
or even sesame seeds could send your
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
child into anaphylaxis
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
my son was only seven months old he was
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
an infant when he experienced his first
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction at a child care center
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
right here in new hampshire
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
he actually did have an allergy action
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
plan in place from his physician because
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
he had already been diagnosed with a
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
peanut allergy
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
so an allergy action plan is something
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the physician will give you
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
that outlines what to do in an allergic
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
reaction it does not outline what needs
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be done day to day within a daycare
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
facility or child care program
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
to prevent an allergic reaction from
 
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.590 align:start position:0%
to prevent an allergic reaction from
happening

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
so we made sure to instruct the child
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
care staff to only feed him food that
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
was brought in from home
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
and just as a note especially in smaller
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
child care facilities there is not
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
typically a cafeteria or a kitchen
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
the the teachers themselves are
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
preparing the meals and snacks for the
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
children and serving them
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
so we had told them not to give him
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
anything other than we brought in from
 
00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:42.710 align:start position:0%
anything other than we brought in from
home

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
one day i came by the child care center
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
after lunch i noticed my son was having
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
an allergic reaction
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
none of the staff had noticed other than
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they remarked that he had seemed
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
pretty fussy at that time
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
immediately i saw that his mouth and
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
chin were covered in hives and so what i
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
did was i followed that out allergy
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
action plan that the staff did have with
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
them and i gave him zyrtec
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's the first step so thankfully he
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
was okay and thankfully i showed up when
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
i did because i caught the reaction in
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
time before it could have progressed
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
into anaphylaxis
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
so we did find out after questioning the
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
staff that he was fed another child's
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
yogurt by a staff member that was
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
covering a break in his classroom this
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
isn't unheard of i have a lot of
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
friends and family in this allergy
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
community and this happens more than you
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:30.789 align:start position:0%
you think
happens

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to be really clear here so
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
this reaction happened even though they
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
had been instructed only to give him
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
food and bottles from home
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
and he already had an allergy action and
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
plan in place for his other known
 
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.430 align:start position:0%
plan in place for his other known
allergy

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
allergy
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
there was another occasion where two
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
staff members who were in charge of
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
caring for my son could not find his
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
epipens when i had asked about them
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
i actually had to instruct them on where
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
to look now this is something that all
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
staff is supposed to know at all times
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
where those medications are in case of
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
an emergency so you can imagine if my
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
son happened to have an allergic
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
reaction and these two staff members
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
were caring for him staff members that
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
again have been
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
through the ceus for um allergic
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
reactions cpr and first aid um they
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
could have been really bad they didn't
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
know where the pens were
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention that because
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
every second counts in an allergic
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
reaction um somebody can go from a minor
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
reaction to severe anaphylaxis within
 
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.909 align:start position:0%
reaction to severe anaphylaxis within
minutes

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's really important to
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
know where those epipens are at all time
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
so as you can imagine all these events
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
had left me angry scared and anxious
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
every time i needed to leave my child in
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
someone else's care
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
so while this bill hb617 does take the
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
first steps of training child care staff
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
in food safety and things like
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination prevention i think
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
we really need to do more to protect our
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
food allergic children especially
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
infants and toddlers who cannot advocate
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
i have read through the new hampshire
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
child care licensing rules
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
which are available on dhhs.nh.gov
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
many times and these are the rules that
 
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
many times and these are the rules that
govern

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
govern
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
how child cares are licensed and the
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
rules that they need to follow in order
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
to keep that license active
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
there are a few key things i'd like to
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
point out that we really need to fix
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
with this and i'd like to if i can just
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on a couple of points from
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
some of the other representatives
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
um to follow up
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me for representative merchant
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative nelson um child care
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
centers are actually not required to
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a nurse on staff so this differs
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
from a k-12 situation
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
um the the staff is required to have cpr
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
and first aid training as well as a few
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
other ceus that are listed in that child
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
care document but just so you know that
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're not required to have a nurse on
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
staff and the majority of them do not
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
um to representative cole fault um every
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
single child care teacher that i've ever
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
seen serves food to children as you
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned it could be just serving a
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
snack it could be serving a full meal
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
but every single person that works with
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
the children in those facilities
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
do have interactions with food and
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
serving kids food so that's why i think
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's really important that
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's everybody that gets this training
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
to representative snow yes um they do
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
feel you do fill out a form when your
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
child does start at a new child care
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.149 align:start position:0%
child does start at a new child care
center

00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
they do ask for allergies but the
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
problem is that
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
every day care or child care program
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
manage these things manage them manages
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
these things differently whether or not
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
they put a plan into place um
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
is is um different from
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
center to center
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
and um i'd just like to point out a
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
couple of holes that i've seen within
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
these child care licensing rules and why
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think this training
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
plus some anaphylaxis training is very
 
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
plus some anaphylaxis training is very
important

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's actually a powerpoint style
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
presentation that is part of those ceus
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
everybody in the the daycare has to take
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
the problem with that it does not review
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
the various types of epinephrine auto
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
injectors and how to use them so there
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
are about six or seven on the market
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
some people are familiar with the
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
standard epipen but there are others
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
that have slightly different ways of
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
using them um so it's very important to
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
understand those differences and like i
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the training that they
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
currently take does not cover all of
 
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.509 align:start position:0%
currently take does not cover all of
those

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't require a passing grade
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
so participants can click through the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
slides of this training can complete the
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
training without reading the information
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
in comparison first aid and cpr training
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually requires hands-on experience
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
and a passing grade so anaphylaxis
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
training as it is a part of something
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
addressing a life-threatening situation
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
it really should be the same that they
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points about food allergy
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
and anaphylaxis training in general
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
that aren't covered by the current rules
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
um any food allergy and anaphylaxis
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
training really should train caregivers
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
and how to prevent exposure to food
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
allergens including food preparation
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
which this bill does cover
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
and how to recognize the symptoms of an
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction in anaphylaxis and
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
also how to treat allergic reactions
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
including one of any of the types of
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
injectable epinephrine that are
 
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.149 align:start position:0%
injectable epinephrine that are
available

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other piece that i'd like
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
to mention here is with food allergy
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
care plan so a food allergy care plan is
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
something that's specific to each child
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
and should include steps to prevent
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
contact with food allergens so this is
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
different from the the plan that comes
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the doctor that tells you what to
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
do in case there's a reaction
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
so currently there is a vague guideline
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
in the rules
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be expanded um
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
i think that we really need to have a
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that these plans are
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed and signed off by all staff
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
typically if they do create a plan it's
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
posted within the classroom but everyone
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
is not required to read it where that
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
comes into a problem is if there are
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
different child care staff members that
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
are covering breaks in other classrooms
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
if they have not been familiar with that
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
plan and they're serving somebody a
 
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.870 align:start position:0%
plan and they're serving somebody a
snack

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
snack
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
they could potentially serve something
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
that the child is allergic to and and
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened to my son
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
also there's no predetermined format or
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
outline so we've had experience with a
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
few different child care centers and
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've had to provide something to them
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
each time so this is problem because
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
if there are multiple children in the
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
same classroom with food allergies they
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
could have different formats on the plan
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
and it just makes it that much harder
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
for the staff to kind of go through and
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
understand what they need to do to keep
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
their children safe
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
so um i really hope that the committee
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
here considers supporting hb 617 and
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
potentially amending it to include
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
required food allergy and anaphylaxis
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
training and requiring more
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive food allergy care plans
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
for child care programs and i'm happy to
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
missed gas
 
00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.069 align:start position:0%
missed gas
do

00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
child day care centers
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
do they have the requirement to have epi
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
or equivalent things on site
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
no not as a
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
as a standard requirement so the problem
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
with an epipen typically that i've seen
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
within legislation is that it does
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
require a prescription so typically what
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
happens is if your child has an allergy
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the physician prescribes um the
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
epinephrine auto injector and then the
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
child has the care plan that's on file
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
with the daycare that um they have the
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
epipen kept at school and then they
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
could are at the daycare and then they
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
can use it that way but there is no
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
global requirement for stocking
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
epinephrine in child care centers in new
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire is there a requirement for the
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
stalking of such
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
devices if a child is present who would
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
need one
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
no that has to come from a
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
um prescription from a physician and
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
then be brought to the school that way
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
this the school themselves that the
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
child care center as far as i know
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
cannot request a uh prescription for
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
just any type of use of a epinephrine
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
auto injector
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh mrs goss for
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
taking my questions are you familiar
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
with this course conference for food
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
protection uh and as a second part to
 
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.270 align:start position:0%
protection uh and as a second part to
that

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
had uh if you are familiar with it uh
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
had the staff attended such a class
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
would that have alleviated the issues
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
that you have uh identified relative to
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
your son
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
great question i have briefly looked
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
into this and i am by no means an expert
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
on it um i think that the training
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
potentially could have avoided my son
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
being served
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
a yogurt that was not his
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it would have helped
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the issue of having the staff
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
identify that my child was having an
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and also would not have helped with the
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
issue of the other two staff members not
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
knowing where those epi pens were um i
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
do think that the bill is important to
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
show um cross-contamination and make
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
sure that that people understand that
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what that training would
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't have my hand up i don't know if
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's still from before it is from
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
before uh if you have had your hand up
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
and you have asked your question please
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
take your hand down
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman my
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
bus drivers some i don't know if
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
preschool kids get bust or not but if
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
they go to kindergarten
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
they are bust do bus drivers have to
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
take some of this uh a course like this
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
i mean a bus driver i know will give out
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
things for christmas it may put the kids
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
a little candy or something like that
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um i as far as i
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
know and in my experience i have not
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
come across a child care center that um
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
uses buses i know in k through 12 we
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
this issue actually came up last year
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the education committee with the
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
previous bill that representative
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
schmidt had mentioned that tried to
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
cover that and no in new hampshire
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
currently bus drivers for k-12 are not
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
have any type of allergy and anaphylaxis
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
training or epipen training
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'm sorry that
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not always polite i forget
 
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not always polite i forget
um

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
because i also had a child with many
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
many food allergies i'm really sensitive
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
to your problem
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm thinking all these additions
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the rules sound really good the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
education especially
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to suggest too that there
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
be something children can wear
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
that says what they're allergic to
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
because when people are taking care of
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
multiple children obviously
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
they can be distracted
 
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
and forget which child is allergic to
 
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
and forget which child is allergic to
which

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm just thinking something
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate that they could wear
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
on top of their clothes or pinned to
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
their clothes that wouldn't be a problem
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
for another reason
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
might be a life-saving thing
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
just to catch people's attention that
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
they if they don't know what that child
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
is allergic to it's a reminder you
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
better check
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
and also be looking at the child to see
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson do you mind if i
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
um answer that or please do comment on
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
that um i think that's a great idea
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that personally we've
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
implemented my son wears a little yellow
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
band that shows what he's allergic to um
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's definitely at this point not a
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and i think that would be a
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
great addition to the food allergy care
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
plan as something that the schools could
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
have in place
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody knows what the
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
child is allergic to
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
um ms gas might that be an optional
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
thing because i could think of scenarios
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
where a child wearing such an indicator
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
could subject the child to some taunting
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
from other students
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
so might that be something to be
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
considered on a case-by-case basis
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i i think just with my
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
experience with other um parents some
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
parents are more sensitive about it than
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
others i would say the majority is more
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
concerned for the child's safety um
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
especially when they're in the infinite
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
toddler stage where the the bullying and
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
the comments may not be an issue but i
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely would agree with you that
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
that should probably be something that
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
would be optional
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
i do not have a question
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
please take your hand down okay
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm going to call on
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative merchant but i don't see
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
him so i think that's a leftover hand
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
miss goss i wouldn't have
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
normally asked this of a member of the
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
public but you seem to be very familiar
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
with our licensing rules
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
of necessity and for that we thank you
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
for your expertise
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put this in the form of a
 
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put this in the form of a
question

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
is it not true that there's a difference
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
between the statute the law that we are
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
looking at today
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
which perhaps ought to specify the broad
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
which perhaps ought to specify the broad
areas

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we need rules on
 
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.870 align:start position:0%
that we need rules on
like

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
food safety
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
allergy recognition
 
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
allergy recognition
um

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know safety plans that sort of thing
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
which could be put in the rule
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the specifics of
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
what is required for daycare which ought
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be done by rulemaking which is not
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is for the department and not for
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
us is that is that a reasonable
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
separation of
 
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:09.990 align:start position:0%
separation of
um

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
separation of responsibilities
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree with that um i would
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
also mention that i have reached out to
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
um dhhs to the child licensing
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator a few times with my
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
questions and and sometimes the answers
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
that i've received back
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
kind of led me to believe that they are
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
not fully familiar with some of these
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
struggles that were having
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
really understanding which side this
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
falls on whether it be on the
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
legislative side or the rule side is
 
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:39.190 align:start position:0%
legislative side or the rule side is
definitely

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know something to to be determined
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i definitely don't have the answer
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
fully to that yes
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could i could i just make a
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
statement to the committee uh if you
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
would permit me well that was a well
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
what you just said was actually a
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
question so that was a lead-in i know
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to do something that's
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
normally inappropriate
 
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.750 align:start position:0%
normally inappropriate
um

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
the issue is that
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
they cannot make rules unless we pass a
 
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.950 align:start position:0%
they cannot make rules unless we pass a
statute

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so for those who are new to the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
statutory and rule making process
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
the department can't make any rules
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
unless they are authorized to
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
by statute so if we pass a statute that
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
authorizes them to make rules in this
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
area then they must make the rules but
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
without a statute passed by us they
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
cannot make rules and i just wanted to
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody on the
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee understood that and understood
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:44.230 align:start position:0%
the difference
but

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we as a committee
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to get down into the weeds of
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what the regulations are
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
we just need to figure out what needs to
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
be permitted
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
and then leave it to the department and
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
i thought that might
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
focus us a little bit more
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative that that's very very
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
helpful and one of the reasons one of
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
the reasons we do that is because
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes the details change
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore we would have to go
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
through a long process to change the law
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
but if we have the broad tenants in
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
place then the rules may be amended very
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
quickly within the department so
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
i i think as we
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
eventually come to closure on this bill
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
we would want to
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
broaden it but only in these general
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
terms thank you for that very much and
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
when the parties flip and you're the
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair again and i'm just a guy i will
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
remember that occasionally it doesn't
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to be a question thank you for the
 
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.790 align:start position:0%
have to be a question thank you for the
president

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
again uh uh ms goss for taking my
 
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
again uh uh ms goss for taking my
question

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
um would someone be able to send us a
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
syllabus on this uh
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
conference for a food protection course
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we have some ideas uh
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think that would be helpful to
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what is the content
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
and as a sidebar to that
 
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.710 align:start position:0%
and as a sidebar to that
i

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
heard you and if you could clarify you
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
said something about not needing a
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
passing grade
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
was that relative to this particular
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
course or something else that was
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
relative to a different course so there
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
is what they call a ceu
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
for food allergy training that the
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
daycare staff is required to take and it
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
is basically just a click-through power
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
point um i've actually gone through it
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
just to to see what it was myself and
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
technically you can click through it
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
without actually reading the slides and
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
it will mark that you have completed it
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
that is in comparison to a cpr first aid
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
class which requires a passing grade in
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
order to be certified
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
um as far as your question regarding um
 
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
um as far as your question regarding um
the

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
the um the the actual training um i can
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
do some additional research into seeing
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
if we can get that for you and i think
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
um also representative schmidt could do
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
that for us as well
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes i just have it real quick and follow
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
up on what was just said a moment ago
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
rather than getting down in the weeds
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
about which uh course and putting that
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
into statute uh could we not just give
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
the authority to dhhs and rule making to
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
approve an appropriate course and not
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
prescribe that here because that might
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
change this organization may go out of
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
business would that also be and i'm
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
asking this maybe more as a question to
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
the chair would that be an acceptable
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
way to handle this
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
hold off a little bit about going
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
forward but i think that's a great
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you welcome back
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
representative marsh you're recognized
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%

and home alone in my home office in
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
brookfield so that we are compliant with
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
91a thank you sir
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question for ms gas
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
or representative schmidt
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we have a few members of the
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you both very much
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes melissa clement
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair um
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
good morning and members of the
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
committee i'm melissa clement i'm
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually the chief of the child care
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
licensing unit at health and human
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
services so i think i can help address
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that have come up and
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity there and i'll
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
answer any additional questions that you
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
may have as well
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
for child care licensing rules we do
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
require that any staff who are
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for supervision of children
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
or being used to meet child staff to
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
child ratios they do have to complete a
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
training on the prevention of in
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
response to emergencies due to food and
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
other allergic reactions so we do have
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
that training i understand that miss gas
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which training she took the

department allows trainings in that
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
broad topic we

a free training from pro solutions that
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
addresses that topic and you need to
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
have at least a passing score of 80
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
percent in order to
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
mark that as complete so all you you're
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
able to go through the course you're
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
able to repeat the sections where you
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
didn't get the questions correct and
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
once you get an eighty percent you have
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
you have passed that ceu and you get the
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%

reaction
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
shall have a written care plan that
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
includes the instructions regarding the
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
foods or other allergens with the child
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
is allergic to and the steps to be taken
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid them
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
a detailed treatment plan to be
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
implemented in the event of an allergic
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
reaction including the names doses and
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
methods of prompt administration of any
 
00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
methods of prompt administration of any
medications

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
medications
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
and specific symptoms that would
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
indicate the need to administer one or
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
more medications
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then at least one child care
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
personnel supervising a child with an
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
allergy care plan shall have completed
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
that training because you do have 90
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
days to complete the training so we also
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
take the additional step that if it's a
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
new staff you still have to ensure that
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
any staff with a child with an allergic
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
care plan has taken the training
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
so there isn't anyone there who's not
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
trained and then each child's care plan
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
shall be posted prominently in the
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
child's classroom and whenever the child
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
may come in contact with the allergen
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
with permission from the parent
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
so those are the steps that we've taken
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
in our rules currently to make sure that
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
children with allergies are identified
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that the staff understand what it is
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
they need to do and how they need to
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
follow through and that they have to
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
have training and also with that they
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
also have to have first aid and cpr
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
certification as well that's a
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
requirement for all staff and child care
 
00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:10.069 align:start position:0%
requirement for all staff and child care
programs

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
underneath our statute
 
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.030 align:start position:0%
underneath our statute
rsa

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
170e-11 which is our rulemaking statute
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
under the provision of 1e
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
it allows for provisions of food
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
clothing educational opportunities
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
program equipment and individual
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
supplies to assure the health and the
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
physical and mental development of
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
children serve so that is the
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
rule-making statute that we use when
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking when we're addressing the
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
needs of children and their health needs
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll turn it back over
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
to you guys and i'll answer any
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions you have
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you miss clement
 
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you miss clement
um

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
given what you've said
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
is this bill necessary
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a follow-up to that let's
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
start with that is this bill necessary
 
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.790 align:start position:0%
start with that is this bill necessary
then

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that when we look at our rules
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's always room for improvement i
 
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
there's always room for improvement i
don't

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
i think that we've addressed them in our
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
rules and we can certainly tweak the
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
rules that we have but i welcome any
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions from the committee to make
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
sure that the children are safe
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
then my follow-up would be
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
based on previous testimony i believe
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
from representative weber
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
are there statutory
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
provisions that you need or would like
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
or both
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
to help you in areas of rulemaking
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
where the statute is presently silent
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
um at least in regards to food allergies
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the statute is silent i
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
believe we have the statutory
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
requirements we need in order to address
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
so while there's always room for
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
improvement you seem your testimony
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
seems to answer the concerns that people
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
have brought would you say
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that we have based on the
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
testimony i heard today i think we have
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient rules to address the concerns
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
i certainly
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
um want the any parents to reach out to
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
us if they've had a concern in their
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
child care program so that we can
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
address those specifically with each
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
child care program um there's always
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately going to be times when a
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
program may not be sufficiently aware of
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
what it is they need to do or you know
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's ways that we can assist the
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
individual programs but i think broadly
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
our rules
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
are there to address those concerns
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask the woman from dhhs
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
whose name i didn't catch
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you could give me that too but
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
you said that the the
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
plan the care plan for responding to
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who has an allergic reaction
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
you need to write that plan up once the
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
child has had
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
an adverse reaction to some food product
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean you don't have a care
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
plan for somebody who the parents report
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
a food allergy but you don't really
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're not required to do the plan
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
until it happens at school or is the way
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
that thing is worded it just says if
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
they've ever had
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
a food
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction either at home in the
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
community or at the daycare that this
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
action plan gets developed
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you clearly on the question
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you representative snow um
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
and my name is melissa clement i'm the
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
chief of the child care licensing unit
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
so the rule i read through them pretty
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
quickly but the way the rule is written
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
it says each child with a food allergy
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
or other allergy so
 
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.430 align:start position:0%
or other allergy so
where

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
you can't write a care plan if analogy
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't yet been identified but that can
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
be identified before they enter the
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
child care program it doesn't need to
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
happen at the program thank you very
 
00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:54.150 align:start position:0%
happen at the program thank you very
much

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to bring uh heather gas back
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
she has her hand up i think she may be
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak to the question that
 
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
was posed heather gass
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
i just did want to point out maybe a
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
couple issues here and maybe melissa
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to clarify so to that
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
previous question about addressing
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
children um who already have an allergy
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
and having a care plan for that i guess
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
i would i would point out that one of
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
the holes is that especially in my
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
child's case he had a reaction to
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
something that he had never had before
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so and i've seen this with again with
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
friends and family where children have
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
their first allergic reaction within the
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
child care program and there's no
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
current plan within the rules to address
 
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.510 align:start position:0%
current plan within the rules to address
that

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
other than the first aid and cpr
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
training and that initial food allergy
 
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.589 align:start position:0%
training and that initial food allergy
training

00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:46.829 align:start position:0%
training
thank

00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
you the chair would now like to
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
recognize rosemary run who has her hand
 
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:57.109 align:start position:0%
recognize rosemary run who has her hand
up

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
good morning can everyone hear me okay
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative rosemary rung i represent
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
merrimack which is hillsboro 21.
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
i became quite knowledgeable about the
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
whole area of food allergies about a
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
when a constituent asked if i would
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
pursue legislation to expand food
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
allergy awareness training
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
to restaurants that fall outside the
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the department of health
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
many communities in new hampshire
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
are licensed by the state but there are
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
very many that are only licensed and
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
inspected by their local jurisdictions
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
so they are exempt from following the
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire food code
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
now back in 19
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 the u.s changed their food
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
code to require
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants to have a food safety
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
manager on site at all time
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire adopted the u.s food code
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
that same year
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
and put into their rules which is hep
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
2300 the requirement of food safety
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
managers for new hampshire restaurants
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire state jurisdiction
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
my bill would have expanded that
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
requirement to restaurants that are else
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
are only in local jurisdictions
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
that law was titled rachel hunger law
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
after the young female student at unh
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
who died from an anaphylactic reaction
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
at a local durham restaurant
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
it was a chinese restaurant she had
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
frequented often but they had changed
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
their recipe for egg rolls unbeknownst
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
to her which now included peanut paste
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
and she was allergic to peanuts
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
so this bill um passed the committee and
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
it went to commerce it passed the house
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
on a voice vote but it got hung up in
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
the senate due to coven delays
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
that bill has now been reintroduced and
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
i'll be testifying in front of commerce
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
at a at a date soon to come
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
the director representative
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative this bill is about child
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
care licensing and we're already way
 
00:58:05.119 --> 00:58:06.829 align:start position:0%
care licensing and we're already way
behind

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay me hurry up
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
okay but in the course of that research
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
i learned that four to eight percent of
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
children in the us suffer from food
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
allergies and that number is going up
 
00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.190 align:start position:0%
allergies and that number is going up
um

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
the training that they would be able to
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
the child care workers would be able to
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
um have is um also the same training
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's now being offered and extended
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
through restaurants throughout new
 
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
through restaurants throughout new
hampshire

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it's it's under a company called
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
servsafe and it's one of the few uh
 
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.390 align:start position:0%
servsafe and it's one of the few uh
training

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
training modules that
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
um is recognized by the department of
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
health and human services for restaurant
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
licensing it takes about one it could be
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
any it could be an eight-day an
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
eight-hour module or sixteen hour module
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are three different types there's
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
in-class virtual self-study
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think if this bill passes there would
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
be a lot of synergy between offering
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
this training to
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
child care workers along with the new
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire restaurant and lodging
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
association who drives a lot of the
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
training management for um their members
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
um and it's about 200
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh to take it that and that's for the
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
highest level of training there's
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's different levels food safety
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
manager food handler
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
and goes on but
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
i as a co-sponsor of this bill i support
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
it 100
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think that it fills in the gap between
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
um actually giving a child food but then
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
preparing the food and recognizing those
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
things which can set off an animal
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
phylactic reaction
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
often it's very easy to let's say
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
substitute flour for corn starch or a
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
product a packaged pancake mix for
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
instance that may have dried egg solids
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
in it so the training enables people to
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
be able to recognize sources of
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
allergens and how they interact
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for this
 
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.950 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for this
opportunity

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh seeing
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
there's no more hands up either
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
panelists or under the attendees
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the hearing
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
on house bill 617 and i'm going to make
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
a suggestion
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
many of us
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
do not want unnecessary regulations
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
however i think many of us are quite
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
aware that some regulations need to be
 
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
aware that some regulations need to be
made

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is this bill
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
necessary as it is
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
or are there a few things that should be
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
in statute that aren't whereby we may
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
help dhhs to do their work and so what
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest representative
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
schmidt thank you so much for raising
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
this issue uh i have personal
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh allergies
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
and experience with anaphylaxis i have
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
dear friends who are of tender age who
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so i am very aware of the situation
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to ask representative
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
schmidt is you have a
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
much further conversation with melissa
 
01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
clement from
 
01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.589 align:start position:0%
clement from
dhhs

01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
find out where the gaps are as the
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
department sees them as you see them and
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps come back to us either
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting the bill goes forward as
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
you've given it to us
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
or sig or perhaps withdraw it or ask us
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
to i to tell it or third come back with
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would round out
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
everything we've discussed today and
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly anybody here is free to call
 
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
certainly anybody here is free to call
you

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
with their input
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
this would normally be the kind of thing
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
we would have a nice work session but
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on crossover deadlines
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we have a lot of bills
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a lot of available
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
computer time so we're getting the word
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
minimize work sessions subcommittees so
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt i'm going to
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that to you
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
and with that the hearing is closed and
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
we will move on
 
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.789 align:start position:0%
we will move on
to

01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.150 align:start position:0%
to
our

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
next item
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and this should take a while
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh gavel
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
i open the hearing now on
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.670 align:start position:0%
house bill
602

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
602
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
relative to reimbursement for
 
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
relative to reimbursement for
telemedicine

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to call on representative
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
jess edwards from finance division three
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
and an alumnus of the greatest committee
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the house both to introduce the bill
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
and also speak
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
and this is important
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
because we have gotten i think this is a
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
technical term
 
01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.990 align:start position:0%

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
of emails about certain aspects of the
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill as originally submitted that the
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment may address
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
so representative edwards would you
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
please introduce your bill and speak to
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
i will uh thank you mr chairman um
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
good morning to the members of hhsea
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'm uh representative jess edwards
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
representing uh auburn
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
i i think for this conversation i i need
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
remind some of you and tell some of you
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
about my background i've been a
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
healthcare informaticist for a couple
 
01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
healthcare informaticist for a couple
decades

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
um i was a when i was a clinical manager
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
at west virginia university i
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
implemented teleradiology there that was
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty early
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
implementation for the era
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
from there i moved to become the deputy
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
program manager of the telemedicine test
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
bed in the mid 90s and i was an
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
instructor at georgetown university
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
during that time frame
 
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.589 align:start position:0%
during that time frame
i

01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
wrote a textbook chapter on military
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
telemedicine along with several articles
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
and spoke at many national conferences
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
on the subject
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
from there i spent two decades as a
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
product manager
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
meeting customer needs with digital
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
imaging so i worked with
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
engineers and technologists to put
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
together emerging solutions to meet
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
clinical needs
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
then as a member of the house i was in
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
2018 a member of the telemedicine
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare reimbursement for
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
telemedicine telehealth study committee
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh that was chaired by senator uh
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
jay kahn
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
and uh we found some interesting things
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
in that study that we we did and
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's been published it showed
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
um what we what we learned was that
 
01:04:57.119 --> 01:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
um what we what we learned was that
medicaid

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
was lagging
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
way behind the commercial insurers for
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
covering telemedicine and and certainly
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
if they weren't covering it they weren't
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursing well
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
so senator khan and i with others
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
introduced legislation to have medicaid
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
catch up to the insurance companies so
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
hey there's emerging clinical practice
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
out there that medicaid is not up to
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
speed on so so let's let's get going
 
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.549 align:start position:0%
speed on so so let's let's get going
well

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
then uh something funny happened uh we
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
had the uh and i don't mean funny as in
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
humorous but
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh quirky we had a uh a pandemic
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
that motivated on the 18th of march of
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
2020 the governor to issue an executive
 
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.190 align:start position:0%
2020 the governor to issue an executive
order

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
that said
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
we were in a state of crisis and that we
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
preserve our health care system
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
and a key strategy for doing that was to
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
find ways in a crisis mode
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
of keeping patients out physically from
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
clinical settings
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's team opened up the
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.549 align:start position:0%
the governor's team opened up the
spigots

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
spigots
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
and said
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
go forth
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
do as much telemedicine as you can
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
telemedicine from this point on shall
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
include audio only so telephone calls
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
can be reimbursed the same
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
must be reimbursed the same or better
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
than in-person care
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
so so clearly the pandemic response was
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know let's not worry about the
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes let's not worry about the
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
monetary impacts we have to preserve our
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
health care system
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
have patients get their care without
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
having to come into the facilities
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
so it really made a lot of sense
 
01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:48.950 align:start position:0%
so it really made a lot of sense
so

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to really talk about the
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
amendment because the bill i i think in
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
retrospect with all the feedback i've
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
gotten i've gotten half a bazillion
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh comments on it the underlying bill
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
itself was kind of a mess
 
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.829 align:start position:0%
itself was kind of a mess
um

01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i submitted an amendment that is
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
really pretty clean what it what it does
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state is going to become agnostic
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
on what the reimbursement rates ought to
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
be for in-person care
 
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
be for in-person care
versus

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
um telemedicine
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
um that that we are not going to be in
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
the role of setting or fixing prices
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
um it it it weights
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
for 180 days after the executive order
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
has expired
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh i picked the 180 days
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
to give
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
clinic clinicians an opportunity
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
to transition their patients from
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of care they've been getting
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the last year and more by the time
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
this is over
 
01:08:02.319 --> 01:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
this is over
to

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
what they consider the appropriate
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
standards of clinical care in the
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
aftermath of the pandemic ceasing
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
so for all the people who are concerned
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
we can't do this in a pandemic i agree
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do this in a pandemic
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
for those of you with eagle eyes
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
and who are looking at
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
the amendment
2021-0195

01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
hotel

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you look down under applicability
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
it it it does a pretty good the ols
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
people heard me they said we're going to
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
make this effective after
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency is over
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
but where there was
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
a mess up is
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
she did not put in the 180 day
 
01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.550 align:start position:0%
she did not put in the 180 day
transition

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
transition
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
so i've contacted her courtney
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
s schaab i think her name is
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and she recognizes
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
um that the 180 days
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
went missing
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
from the amendment so so i i apologize
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
to the committee there's an amendment to
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
um coming but but so the the the
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
two things it does and the one thing it
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
does not do
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
is the two things it does is uh it it
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
will wait it waits until after the state
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
of emergency is over and it creates uh a
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
grace period i think of 180 days if the
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee thinks it should be a
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
different number that's fine
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
and also it breaks the connection
 
01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:40.309 align:start position:0%
and also it breaks the connection
between

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
the requirement the mandate to reimburse
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
telemedicine at the same or higher rate
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
than they do in person care
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's an artificial
 
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.630 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's an artificial
edict

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
edict
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and a crisis
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
but does not make long-term
 
01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.870 align:start position:0%
but does not make long-term
sense

01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
and and and then the the thing that this
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
does not do
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
is this bill does not in any way
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
step on the special provisions that we
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
need to deal with the pandemic
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
we we take a breathing period after the
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic before this bill
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
takes effect so for those concerned
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
about the pandemic i assure you this
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill has nothing
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do with that
 
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
to do with that
um

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and because i've gotten a whole lot
 
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
and and because i've gotten a whole lot
of

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
of
messages

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
messages
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
saying that i that i i'm being
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
short-sighted i want to assure people
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
that i'm actually being very
 
01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
that i'm actually being very
long-sighted

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
long-sighted
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
my vision of telemedicine
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh really started in the 1960s with reba
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
ben scooter and cecil whitson
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
who i got to know as as a young teenager
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
um and i got to understand the
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
telemedicine program that they put in
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
place with the nebraska psychiatric
 
01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
place with the nebraska psychiatric
institute

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
institute
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
between omaha and norfolk
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
i i i know from then and from reading
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
that the technology
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't really been invented just a year
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
earlier it was a t's invention of some
 
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
earlier it was a t's invention of some
critical

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
components that even made it possible
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
so the university of nebraska medical
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
center got interested in telemedicine
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
even though it cost a bazillion dollars
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
more than in-person care because they
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
had a clinical research component to it
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
but if you go back in time telemedicine
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
really really expensive and the price
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
points are coming down
 
01:11:41.679 --> 01:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
points are coming down
rapidly

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i think it's analogous to a lot of
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
the arguments people used to have
 
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.229 align:start position:0%
the arguments people used to have
about

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
canals and railroads
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
they were both ways to transport
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh goods from supply centers to
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
population centers
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh had
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh and there was a great deal of
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
competition the government tended to
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
favor canals private industry tended to
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
pro uh favor railroads
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's this bill where um we've said
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
that the price mechanism between
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and in-person care
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
is sore like if at that time when canals
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
and railroads were finding their their
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
place in our transportation network that
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
somebody had issued an edict that said
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
one pound of coal
 
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.950 align:start position:0%
one pound of coal
shall

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
be charged the same amount for transport
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of the
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
method of conveyance
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative representative edwards uh
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're way behind in our schedule would
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
you please focus on just the high points
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
without the history as much as i love
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
history and wrap it up thank you
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the reason
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir i will but the reason i'm
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
belaboring it
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
is because um
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
disconnecting or freeing up the pricing
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism is the core of this bill
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
and there will be people on the
 
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
and there will be people on the
committee

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
committee
who

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
who
will

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
want to keep the pricing mechanism
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
locked up
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure telemedicine and in-person
 
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
to ensure telemedicine and in-person
care

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
care
forever

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
forever
more

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
mandated in the statute as it is today
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
and and it's those people i'm trying to
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
speak to to say
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
please think of this differently than
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
what you have been this is this the
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
pricing mechanism is essential to
 
01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.709 align:start position:0%
pricing mechanism is essential to
sending

01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
sending
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
market signals to investors and and
 
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
market signals to investors and and
others

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
to because we have an entire
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
re-engineering of the health care system
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
we have rapidly emerging technology
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to give us a tremendous
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
number of options we've not had
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
so so i'll skip down um at your request
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
let me skip down to
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
a key part of this um and i you may want
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
to take a look at my testimony i sent it
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
in last night it hopefully it reads like
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
an interesting
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
academic paper
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
but one of the things i wanted to point
 
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
but one of the things i wanted to point
out

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:14:24.239 --> 01:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
is that
their

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
technology changes things initially by
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
substituting one approach for another
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at now with
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
telemedicine instead of traveling we're
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
in instead of doing uh traveling to the
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
in-person care we can virtually travel
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
well what's going to happen
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
as this evolves is there's going to be a
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
period of time where uh increased
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
coordination because of the technology
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
is in place will start to happen so
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
you'll start to see people who worry
 
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.709 align:start position:0%
you'll start to see people who worry
about

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
coordinating social determinants of
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
health for example be able to do
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
person-centered care much more
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
effectively they'll be enhanced
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
abilities to communicate with people
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the community and throughout
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
the state that's because the technology
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
will begin to be more familiar and be
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
more leveraged
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
what what the third order effect is is
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
when we totally create new new methods
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
of providing clinical care
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
so like with the advancements in
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
wearable biotech
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh and ubiquitous communications
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's what what we're going to
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
see in a few years
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
the constant transmittal of your
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
personal medical data to a storage
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
center where there will be artificial
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
intelligence applying smart algorithms
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not the the
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
person is has remained within specs
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
if you get thrown out of
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh standards
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
you go from being a person to a patient
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
the the the the watch can send an alert
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
saying hey you need to go see somebody
 
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.709 align:start position:0%
saying hey you need to go see somebody
now

01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to tie that to gps we'll
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
be able to tie that to scheduling
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
software and to
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
geo locators
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
to say you need to go see someone now
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way there's a person four
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
blocks away from here and they're
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
available right now
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i'm going to cut
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
you off right now we have in this
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee as you should know enough
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
people for me to staff a medical center
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
a counseling center and a pharmacy so
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest now that they ask
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
you questions because a lot of what
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying most of us know very well
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
from living it
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
i guess the space bar didn't work can
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
you hear me now yes we can
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for taking my
 
01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for taking my
question

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me like part of um
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
your agenda here is not to pick winners
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
and losers and to be
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
um to be open to which services are
 
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
um to be open to which services are
more

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective and yet
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
video telehealth will be covered but
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
audio will not necessarily be covered
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
now we have received many many many many
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
emails from lots of people but i think a
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
majority of them have been from
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treaters and
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
mental health clinicians
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir so if i may are you looking at
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
0195 hotel
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think i am i am look at look at line
 
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.189 align:start position:0%
i think i am i am look at look at line
14

01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
14
 
01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
14
where

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh line 14 is it says audio and it
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
deletes the reference to audio only
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
i i have
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
left audio only
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
as an option
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh where the government doesn't need to
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
take a position on when audio only
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
is good clinical care right like for
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
example i have diabetes i had a phone
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
call where the provider went over my
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
readings with me and we talked about it
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
she determined whether or not i needed a
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
change in medication
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
all of that was good clinical practice
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
over the phone
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
but if i had needed to see my
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist to determine you know
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
progress of my eye surgery
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
i probably would have had to go in
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
person so some things are open to
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
telephone calls or some things or not
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
this bill stays neutral it stays out of
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative shapiro
 
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative shapiro
follow-up

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
well i haven't asked my question yet
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me that um audio is an
 
01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.630 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me that um audio is an
option

01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not one that's mandated
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
video and audio are mandated so my
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
question really is
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
um do you have research do you have data
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
audio only is less effective than audio
 
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.189 align:start position:0%
audio only is less effective than audio
video

01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
and do you also have research which
 
01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
and do you also have research which
might

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
the number of people that have been able
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
to access services through audio only
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that would not be able to if there was
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
not audio only mandated
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
i i i'll address that but i first need
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
to just say that we have an
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation difference i i think
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
lines 13
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
through 15 do the opposite of what you
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
suggest i think it includes audio only
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
as a reimbursable uh option
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh what what this bill is trying to do
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
is to get out of the the micro
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
management of exactly which clinical
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
services can be done over the phone and
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
which ones cannot
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
i i i think you would agree with me
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
that there are examples that you and i
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
can think of right now where telephone
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
only is okay
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
but there are other examples where
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
telephone only doesn't
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
do it it does it's not adequate clinical
 
01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.910 align:start position:0%
do it it does it's not adequate clinical
care

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's not up for us
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
to mandate reimbursement in a situation
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
where the clinical effectiveness can
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
vary between
 
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
vary between
different

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
clinical requirements
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
so your your other question about am i
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with research
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
well i know that clinical efficacy
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
research research in various aspects of
 
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.550 align:start position:0%
research research in various aspects of
telemedicine

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh have been taking place for 20 30
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
years so so depending on on what
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
specific clinical subspecialty
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
you would have to burrow into
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the available research to see whether or
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
not that particular clinical question
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.550 align:start position:0%
has been
asked

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
i will i will
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
defer to the next questioner
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you mr chair
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
um i just want to clarify something to
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm seeing this properly the
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
concern that was raised in most of the
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
people that contacted me through email
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
was that they felt they would be limited
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
to audio
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
or video only
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
however it reads now in your amendment
 
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:19.990 align:start position:0%
however it reads now in your amendment
that

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
the uh coverage will be for
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
all modes of telehealth including video
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
and audio
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
and other electronic media
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
so uh that whole concept of them having
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
to have video i'm
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
see i'm reading that that has been taken
 
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.470 align:start position:0%
see i'm reading that that has been taken
out

01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
and dismissed and that people will now
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
be able to use just audio
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that is exactly my intent
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative folsom i i did get a lot
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
of feedback and and it was it was pretty
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
clear that the audio only issue was uh
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
causing a great disturbance and so i've
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
gotten the government out of making
 
01:23:04.719 --> 01:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
gotten the government out of making
those

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
incremental judgment calls that's up to
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
the clinical efficacy research and
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
decisions by others
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
this the space bar didn't work
 
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.790 align:start position:0%
this the space bar didn't work
um

01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i'm going to give
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
you an um a situation i encountered and
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
you can help me understand how this bill
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
would impact the two different
 
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
would impact the two different
situations

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
went to see a pulmonologist
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the term
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the first time i saw him was an in
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
in-person visit
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so i understand that the charges
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be for an in-person visit
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
the second time i went to see him
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
the coped rules were in place and i was
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
um and i went to
 
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.830 align:start position:0%
um and i went to
the

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
office i was brought to a tour a
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
treatment room
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
where the where the nurse took my weight
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and blood pressure
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then told me to wait for the phone
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
to ring
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
where i took i answered the phone it was
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
my physician we had a conversation
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
and when the
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
conversation was done
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
they let me leave the building
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
he charged me for an office visit
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
another month or so later
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
i had
 
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
i had
a

01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
telemedicine call
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
video and and voice over my telephone
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
to ask basically the same questions i
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
had when i was when i was at his
 
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
had when i was when i was at his
practice

01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
during my second visit so
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
would all three of those situations be
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
charged the same
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
under this under your bill
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for the question and i
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
hope you're you're feeling strong and
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
robust uh
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the pulmonologist is helping you
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
with all of that i have asthma by the
 
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
with all of that i have asthma by the
way

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
so uh i would say that it depends on the
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
time frame we're talking about
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about the time frame
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
that begins 180 days after
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the eo is uh vacated or or expired
 
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.990 align:start position:0%
the the eo is uh vacated or or expired
then

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
um the ability to charge and be
 
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.830 align:start position:0%
um the ability to charge and be
reimbursed

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
by the insurance carriers would be based
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
on their independent assessment on
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
the the visit met clinical efficacy
 
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.430 align:start position:0%
the the visit met clinical efficacy
standards

01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
and not being a pulmonologist but kind
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
of imagining what sort of
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions you were being asked
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
it would just seem to me that the
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
pulmonologist perceived
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
that he or she was able to provide you
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
good care
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
through video conferencing without you
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
physically having to travel for a
 
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
physically having to travel for a
weigh-in

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
weigh-in
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and uh i i think i think that would be
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
fine i think reimbursement for that is
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
great i
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
i i want to see healthcare much like the
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
way we do banking these days where
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's all it we do far more of it online
 
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
it's all it we do far more of it online
uh

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
at midnight than we do
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
in person at the bank itself so
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
so i would i would think that
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
what this bill says is we don't tell the
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers what to do
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
we just say here's an issue
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
you guys work it out
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
and and i think i think
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
that sort of market mechanism is what's
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
rationalize the system the best over the
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
long term does that answer your question
 
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.149 align:start position:0%
long term does that answer your question
um

01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
not quite could i follow up you may
 
01:27:16.639 --> 01:27:18.470 align:start position:0%
not quite could i follow up you may
um

01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
in both the the second and my third
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
visit um
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
both of those situations were only
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
voice conversation
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the in-office visit i didn't even
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
have a video with my physician
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
my last visit i actually had a video
 
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.629 align:start position:0%
my last visit i actually had a video
so

01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
my in-office visit i am assuming would
 
01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
my in-office visit i am assuming would
be

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be paid by the insurance company
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
for an in-office visit the third
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
situation with essentially the same
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions but over my telephone
 
01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:51.990 align:start position:0%
questions but over my telephone
were

01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
essentially the same
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
but i was out of the office
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me i would have after
 
01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me i would have after
this

01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.629 align:start position:0%
this
this

01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill goes into place 180 days after the
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
the eo
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
that then i'm at the mercy of my
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company as to whether i would
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed at the office rate or not
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that is that what i'm hearing
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
well representative cannon that's
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
probably what you're hearing that that's
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
not what i'm trying to say though uh i i
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't think insurance companies are
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
merciless so i wouldn't use the term at
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies mercy i do i i
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
would just uh
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
remind you of what the 2018 telemedicine
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
study found which was that commercial
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers were doing a vastly
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
better job of covering and paying for
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
telemedicine than the state was
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
and that our goal in 2018 was to get the
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
state to catch up the government was the
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
problem and that was just two years ago
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so i think insurance companies
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
have a built-in incentive to build the
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
right health care system to take care of
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
patients and and so they're looking at
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
cost access and and quality every bit as
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
much as any other
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
player so i don't i
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
i only just would take issue with the
 
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.990 align:start position:0%
i only just would take issue with the
terminology

01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
but but the intent is
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
this would get the government out of
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
that decision it would allow the
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to act like
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
a free party in the health care system
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh representative
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
edwards i just have a question there's a
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
phrase you used three times because of
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the three different types of coverages
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
and uh that is where you refer to a uh
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
criteria of good clinical methodologies
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
based on research or accepted practice
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
so i was curious
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
you alluded to it a little bit before
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
but do we have this research and if so
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
can you give reference to that research
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and could you perhaps clarify who makes
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
regarding which
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
research or practice
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
i okay your
 
01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
i okay your
um

01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kenner i would
 
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.870 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kenner i would
say

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
that the research in telemedicine
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
is much like the research in any
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
clinical subspecialty
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
just one
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
source one database where the research
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
gets filed and gets sent
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's just there's not one
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
arbiter of all known research
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
in any of the clinical subspecialties
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
there are
associations

01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
associations
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh that that tend to to be expert there
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
are telemedicine associations that one
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
can join to where
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
they can obtain
 
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
they can obtain
um

01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.189 align:start position:0%
um
regular

01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
newsletters and the like of telling them
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on in
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
in telemedicine research so it's
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is as viable an academic
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
research area
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
as any of our
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
clinical sub-specialties in my view at
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
least that's the way it was you know
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
when we were the telemedicine test bed
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
there was research being done in hawaii
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
medical college of georgia
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
university of virginia
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's just being done
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
in a highly distributed manner like all
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
academic medicine
 
01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:35.830 align:start position:0%
academic medicine
um

01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i forget the second part of your
 
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
and i forget the second part of your
question

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.189 align:start position:0%
question
look

01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
you may follow up with that yes well
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
that is exactly my question because
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
there is no one standard people will
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
disagree so my question is who
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
makes that decision because somebody has
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
to actually make that decision to
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
implement these
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
rules that you're kind of discussing
 
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.229 align:start position:0%
rules that you're kind of discussing
here

01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
who has that power because that's not
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay so back in the olden days when um i
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
was representing positron emission
 
01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.229 align:start position:0%
was representing positron emission
tomography

01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
tomography
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
and how we would apply pat to various
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
clinical scenarios
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would do studies
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh we would have our academic nuclear
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
medicine people look at it if if we
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
determined it was efficacious
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
i was the one that would go to the blue
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
crosses and blue shields and say
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is the care we're providing
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're not reimbursing us for this
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
here's our medical research would you
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
please uh begin to reimburse us for this
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
because this is better than the uh
 
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
because this is better than the uh
alternatives

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the blue cross and blue shield as a
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
as an independent payer would would
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
consider what was being said and and
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to reimburse us
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately we ended up getting a lot
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
of yeses and pet today is an extremely
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
viable part of nuclear medicine
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't always that way
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
and and so that those same sorts of
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
dialogues with payers
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh who are free to to choose and to
 
01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:18.550 align:start position:0%
uh who are free to to choose and to
think

01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
and to participate in the health care
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
system uh i think uh can make those
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
decisions without
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
government telling them how to how they
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
must decide
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
well you're saying that at the authority
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
rights entirely with the insurers is
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the answer
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
well this bill primarily tells gets the
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
government away from telling
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
insurers what they must do so the effect
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
of this bill would it would be to let
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
insurers decide what they they think
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
they should do
 
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:55.990 align:start position:0%
they should do
so

01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
so like any good argument i think uh
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
this bill will let insurers do what they
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
i would guess
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
the senate should continue
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
under any new rules and regulations
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
state insurance departments adopt is
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
i i didn't
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
follow your question i'm sorry mr chair
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you said this bill would let
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
insurance companies do what they want
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that would only be under
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the control of the state insurance
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
departments correct
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir i i
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
assume that was is understood yes we
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
have okay
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
we have insurance we have somebody from
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
insurance in the batting order here my
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
um as part-time ceo of a medical
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:03.230 align:start position:0%
many of the
 
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.390 align:start position:0%
many of the

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.910 align:start position:0%

telemedicine

01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
encounters many of the telephone only
 
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.470 align:start position:0%
encounters many of the telephone only
encounters

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
encounters
 
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
encounters
occur

01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
occur
from

01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
our physical facility
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
which we still have to pay heat light
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
rent on still have to have a supportive
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
staff so the idea that telemedicine
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
might give insurance companies the
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
wicked thought of reimbursing at a lower
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
rate than an in par in
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
house in person visit uh makes me as
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
frightened as the several thousand
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
people who emailed us would you comment
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
on that please i i
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that you're
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
i would generalize your point to be
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
the cost structures of inpatient care or
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
in-person care and telemedicine those
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
cost structures are fundamentally
 
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
cost structures are fundamentally
different

01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
yeah there are some overlaps but the
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
cost structures are fundamentally
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
different it's because those cost
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
structures are different that i think
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the pricing mechanism ought to also be
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
adaptable to accommodate
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
the relevant cost structures so so i
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
again i don't presume the insurance
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
companies to be
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.470 align:start position:0%
companies to be
um

01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
an adversarial part of our health care
 
01:36:21.679 --> 01:36:23.110 align:start position:0%
an adversarial part of our health care
system

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
prior to 2018 they were reimbursing for
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
telemedicine at a much better rate and
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
much more coverage than the state
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
government was
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
so i i think we should have a little bit
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
more faith that that uh
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
clinical re-engineering is essential
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the technology gives us new tools that
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have there will be newer tools
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
and more re-engineering that can take
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
place in the future i think we need an
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
adaptable flexible system i believe this
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill does happen all right one more for
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
me before i uh turn it over to others as
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
a person who is a strong believer in
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
having a great deal of faith i also know
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
that i have to hire a person on my staff
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
because it is adversarial and sometimes
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have to fight for what is right and
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
we tie up and waste a lot of money going
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
into a battle that shouldn't be fought
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
because it is adversarial that is not a
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
question and i am now going to call on
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you

edward for taking my question
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
um in in the uh amendment um as uh
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative knurk has identified
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
there to me there's two parts to that
 
01:37:47.679 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
there to me there's two parts to that
one

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
is the the um

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
i invented the phrase
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
in accordance with good clinical
 
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
in accordance with good clinical
methodologies

01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
methodologies
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
supported by clinical fspc research or
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
accepted clinical practice
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
to basically get the state of new
 
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
to basically get the state of new
hampshire

01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
out of price setting
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
and to allow
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
other experts to do use their
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
regular procedures
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
for determining what emerging
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
standards of care should be reimbursable
 
01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
standards of care should be reimbursable
there

01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
there are new reimbursable decisions
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
being made every year and so i just
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
think this would be added to the pile of
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
decisions that would need to be made
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a better term either you
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
or dr uh representative kenner i i'm not
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
wed to the term i'm was intending to
 
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.669 align:start position:0%
wed to the term i'm was intending to
communicate

01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:39:53.679 --> 01:39:54.550 align:start position:0%
communicate
that

01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
there are practices that occur
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the insurance industry that should be
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:40:06.239 --> 01:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
yeah

01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that we uh just
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
take the committee people with hands up
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
at the present time and then
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
move on uh i'd like to call on somebody
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the insurance
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
department who might be able to answer
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
this better but we have representative
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
cofault in the queue and then
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro so representative
 
01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:30.709 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro so representative
cofoult

01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um i i think the
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the timing of this was a key concern and
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
i understand that's being addressed by
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
um or that can be addressed by amendment
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that's uh that's a a move in
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the right direction
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
um i guess you know on its face i think
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are reading this and
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're seeing this as a
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
um sort of a question of of uh paying
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
paying for someone's time differently if
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's remote versus if it is in person
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
um you stated that the cost structure is
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different for telehealth
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i think there there is a you know
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
over the longer term there may be
 
01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.550 align:start position:0%
over the longer term there may be
telemedicine

01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
um alternatives that do create
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and have a fundamentally uh
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
different cost structure but
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
i think for most people this is seen as
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
a question of time spent working
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
remotely versus time spent
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
in the room physically with a patient so
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to understand um sort
 
01:41:34.719 --> 01:41:36.390 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to understand um sort
of

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
how you see this as
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
how you see the cost structure as being
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different
 
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.709 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different
um

01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
because again i think the the main
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
concern is a lot of people just feeling
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
like this is
 
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.350 align:start position:0%
like this is
um

01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
really about the time they're spending
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
with their patients uh
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
one way versus another way
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
um the the the telemedicine alternative
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
being something that has uh is very
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
important not only during the pandemic
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
but for some patients who have
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh getting out and about um
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
can also be uh convenient to them so so
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
you can allow can you elaborate on the
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of the sort of the longer term
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
implications around telemedicine and how
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
you think the cost structure could
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
let's look at what has happened
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
into the field of mammography
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
mammography used to require a
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
radiologist who would spend a great deal
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of time looking for very very small
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
micro calcifications
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that unless you were really trained
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
and really experienced would would uh be
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
very difficult in many cases to see
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that has happened
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
because the digitization of mammography
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
the technology introduction is that we
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
now have computer-aided diagnosis which
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't do the job for the radiologist
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
but it it uses artificial intelligence
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
to take a look at those uh the patterns
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
and to highlight for the radiologists
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
some areas of concern that can be
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
checked off almost like a little
 
01:43:13.199 --> 01:43:14.790 align:start position:0%
checked off almost like a little
checklist

01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so the uh
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
the uh effectiveness of the mammograph
 
01:43:20.239 --> 01:43:21.350 align:start position:0%
the uh effectiveness of the mammograph
fist

01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
fist
 
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.550 align:start position:0%
fist
and

01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the time involved have changed as a
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
result of the introduction of technology
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
at its core it's the same you have a
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
person reading an image but the
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
technology has fundamentally changed
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
how much time gets spent and the the
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
quality of how it gets spent
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
so so in the future with telemedicine
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to take all of
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
these biotech feeds that come from our
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
wearables particularly if we have
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
chronic conditions and those will be
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
monitored by an artificial intelligence
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
system that can determine whether we're
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
in standard or not and to send us to
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
inpatient care or in-person care or not
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
depending on those metrics
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
the way that person inter engages in the
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
health care system is going to be
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different it'll raise
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
it when that artificial intelligence
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
software kicks in and says hey
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
you need to go see somebody now is that
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
a clinical visit is that a billable
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
clinical visit
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
under under the eo i think you could
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
argue that it is
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
but what i but to answer your your
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think we can see these examples of
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
where technology insertions
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually does change
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the quality access and cost
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
parameters of how health care gets
 
01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.390 align:start position:0%
parameters of how health care gets
provided

01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
and our clinical systems will continue
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be re-engineered to take advantage of
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
it for example nobody did telemedicine
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
or few people did telemedicine 20 years
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
ago now we're debating you know how much
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
we should pay for it in 20 years we're
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to be debating you know something
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
totally different about technology and
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's killing our local communities
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
because people in montana are
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
doing telemedicine services for our
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
patients in laconia
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.629 align:start position:0%
you know so
so

01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
everything's going to shift because of
 
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.310 align:start position:0%
everything's going to shift because of
technology

01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.350 align:start position:0%
technology
so

01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.430 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
i talk a lot i hope i address your
 
01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
i talk a lot i hope i address your
question

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.950 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this is a follow-up or
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
just a con
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
an observation you know that the
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
definition under may follow up or
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
observed go ahead okay thank you mr
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um so the observation is that
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
telemedicine um
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
many of many of the
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
many of the sections under the uh under
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
the original bill
specify

01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
specify
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
persons uh
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
licensed by the board shall be permitted
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
to provide services through the use of
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
telemedicine so i i
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
suspect that might preclude some of the
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
um some of the artificial intelligence
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
technology you're you're discussing but
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
um i'll i'll leave it at that
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
as a footnote i just emailed you uh
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendment 205h which corrected the
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
missing 180 days so
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for the chaotic nature of the
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
amendments but you should have one in
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
your inbox that does what i intended
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards i would
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh dj bettencourt and or chris necopolis

in the meeting could they be brought up
 
01:46:51.199 --> 01:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
in the meeting could they be brought up
please

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%

01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
dj bettencourt and i have the pleasure
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
of serving as the deputy commissioner of
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire insurance department
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
i've been on the job for about two weeks
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
now and i'm getting my feet wet and so
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is my a testimonial debut in this
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
new role so
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
take it easy on me if you would sure
 
01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:31.590 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
yeah right
[Laughter]

01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh as has been the long-standing uh
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
policy of the insurance department i am
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
here this morning not to take a position
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
on this particular piece of legislation
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
but rather to share some thoughts with
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
as you know 2020 was a big and
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
significant year for telemedicine
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
including legislative changes that
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
included a number of insurance
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
telemedicine coverage and payment
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to appreciate that given
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
how rapidly the landscape has expanded
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
for telemedicine it is really too early
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
to fully understand the totality of what
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
those impacts will be as it pertains to
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
the health insurance market
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
as an example telemedicine has obviously
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
been an important tool during the covet
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic to minimize as best as
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
possible of course under the
 
01:48:25.119 --> 01:48:26.550 align:start position:0%
possible of course under the
circumstances

01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
disruption to patient care and has
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
allowed patients to continue having
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
access to their health care providers
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
what is less clear however going forward
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
is what the continued demand for
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
telehealth services will be as the
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic subsides
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
for some this new innovation will be
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
their preferred method of accessing care
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
but for others they will be eager to
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
return to the familiarity of a clinical
 
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
return to the familiarity of a clinical
setting

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
but the degree to which individuals fall
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
into one bucket or the other is going to
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
be important for
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
everyone to monitor
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
following these issues closely is going
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
to be i think an important task for the
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
commission to study telehealth services
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
that was created last year
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
to really
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
carefully look at
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
one thing that this committee and others
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
is going to want to monitor is the
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
potential for unexpected pressure on
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums and there are
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
some specific questions
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think that are going to be important
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
to bear in mind
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
the first is will the most expensive
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
in-person providers be the ones to
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
expand their telemedicine services the
 
01:49:36.239 --> 01:49:37.510 align:start position:0%
expand their telemedicine services the
most

01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
the second will be
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
will competition among health care
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
providers decline because carriers can't
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
negotiate telemedicine rates separately
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
from in-person rates
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
and finally will the preferred
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
telemedicine providers be out of state
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
without an in-person equivalent rate
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
again the answers to those questions i
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe can be fully answered
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
because we lack the benefit of long-term
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
data trends
 
01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
and a non-coveted pandemic experience
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
however the policy choices in reaction
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
to them are for you the legislature to
 
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.950 align:start position:0%
to them are for you the legislature to
decide

01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
coverage for audio only services is a
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
significant policy development and
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring how that plays out i think is
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to be an important course of
 
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.109 align:start position:0%
going to be an important course of
action

01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
my final comment here
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of tyler brennan who is par
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
excellence in the insurance department
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh health insurance is that the
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh provision that um the new provision
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
that removes some potentially confusing
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
language as it pertains to in person
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a positive change from an enforcement
 
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
is a positive change from an enforcement
perspective

01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
but on that point i also want to be
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
clear we are only commenting on that to
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
the extent that the previous language
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
had raised some questions and confusion
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the fact that
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
attempted to clarify some of that so my
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
comment should not be seen as an opinion
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the value or drawbacks of the
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursement parity policy decision but
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate the fact that there was
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
an attempt to clean up some confusing
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
language as with that said mr chairman i
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
will do my absolute best to answer
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions and if i don't have the answer
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
for you today i will certainly get it
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
for you in very short short order
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
well all i can say is i wish i was that
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
good two weeks into any job i've ever
 
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
started thank you so much representative
 
01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:41.589 align:start position:0%
started thank you so much representative
shapiro

01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
mr betancourt for taking my question
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
you said that your department was
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill
 
01:51:50.239 --> 01:51:51.350 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill
um

01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
and yet you spoke about the
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission on telemedicine which was um
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
part of house bill 1623
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
which was tasked with
 
01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.229 align:start position:0%
which was tasked with
um

01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
researching the use of telemedicine and
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
making recommendations for the future um
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to read too much into what
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
you said but
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it's wise that
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
changes in the telemedicine
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
provisions come out of that commission
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
question i i think the ultimate
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
determination of who should make the
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
decisions on policy
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh is one that you and the members of
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
that commission should decide what i am
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
very firm on is that it is not the role
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department our role is
 
01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.109 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department our role is
to

01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
enforce the insurance rules and
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
regulations that are on the books those
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations come as a result
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the deliberation of the legislature
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
and other legislative commissions and
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
committees and boards and
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is what we will always continue to
 
01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.149 align:start position:0%
that is what we will always continue to
do

01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
bettencourt for taking my question
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
is it not
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
a significant possibility
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the language in the proposed
 
01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the language in the proposed
amendment

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
that without the requirement for parity
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
who have a great deal more bargaining
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
power than any individual practitioner
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
will particularly in the area of mental
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
health practice
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
sees the opportunity to lower rates
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
which we already know
 
01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
which we already know
are

01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
woefully inadequate
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
to ensure that
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
practitioners get even less
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for their services than
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
they are now getting
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative a possibility yes
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
but what
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony i think speaks to is that
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
the extent to which that
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
would be the case i think is still
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat unknown again because you have
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
had a very rapid
 
01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:18.149 align:start position:0%
had a very rapid
um

01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
expansion of telehealth in a very short
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
you don't quite have the data of those
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
long-term trends to tell you the degree
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
merchant thank you mr chairman
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh director bettencourt
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
when i look at the healthcare market
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
today it's relatively fragmented in the
 
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.310 align:start position:0%
today it's relatively fragmented in the
payer

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
payer
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
help me understand what part of the
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
healthcare market this is actually
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
applying to you know look at medicare
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid under arista you got
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans you've got commercial
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
plans so what part of this market are we
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually talking about how large is it
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
compared to the overall market
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative i think certainly you're
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the the individual market
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh certain you're certainly you're
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
looking potentially at the large and
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
small group markets
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman you may
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
so basically the market that's left that
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
this applies to is the most vulnerable
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
market we have in the marketplace
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
because to representative weber's point
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
of view these are people that don't have
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bargaining power to actually stand
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
up to the insurance industry to
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate on their own so my concern is
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
that we're basically leaving these
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
people here without some sort of defense
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
upon how they can receive the care in
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate manner but also
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
economically provide
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of reimbursement to the
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the concern representative
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
and again how you'd like to proceed in
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue is entirely in the
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee in the
 
01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.310 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee in the
legislature

01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative betancourt
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh one of the options as you know that
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
um is to retain a bill and work on it
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
over the summer
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
and it sounds to me like you're looking
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
more longitudinal
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh set of data let's go out three or
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
four months more and see what we've got
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
not asking you to make a recommendation
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
but just your own
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
common sense uh now two weeks on the job
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
would waiting longer to look at
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
additional data seem to run parallel
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
with what you've been telling us
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um my
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
long-standing philosophy has always been
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
that more information and more data
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
generally gets you to a better end
 
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.350 align:start position:0%
generally gets you to a better end
result

01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
but whether or not you'd like to go that
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
direction of course is entirely up to
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much and um may you
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
be blessed as you head into your third
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
week of employment
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
william marsh
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
hello can people hear me
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
very good i'm trying to participate
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
myself on this my internet has gone down
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you mr chairman for taking
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
my question and uh thank you dj for
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
participating with our hearing today
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to meet with you under
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
other circumstances um my question has
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
to do with the the federal 1135 waiver
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
which temporarily allows audio only
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
telehealth during the coveted 1910
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
endemic and as we all sincerely hope
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
someday the covet 19 pandemic is going
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
to come to an end
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
is it going to create a problem that we
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
have actually put audio only telehealth
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
into statute here
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
if it is no longer allowed under federal
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative marsh i missed
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.030 align:start position:0%
the question
right

01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
under federal law we are allowed to do
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
audio only telehealth because of an 1135
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
waiver that was issued pursuant to 42
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
usc uh 320b 5b
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
because previously that was not allowed
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
to be reimbursed by the center for
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare services
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
are we going to have a problem that we
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
have put audio only services into new
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute as being reimbursable
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
if it ceases to be allowed under federal
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
law by this temporary waiver that was
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
only put in place for the coveted 19
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh thank you representative for
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
repeating your question uh i i don't
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
know for certain that of course is is
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
potentially a problem uh but that's
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
something that i'm going to have to take
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%

that the research for that might take
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
some time which of course is a good
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
reason for us to retain this bill so

02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
a small business owner i own a
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy practice here in nashua i
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
also have another site in massachusetts
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
all right i briefly got the overview of
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
the amendments and even as the amendment
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
is written i believe that this is a
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
small business crusher we cannot compete
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh with our larger
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
hospital systems and contracting and
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh and i understand that we
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to do price fixing as
 
02:01:44.639 --> 02:01:45.750 align:start position:0%
don't want to do price fixing as
government

02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
but in this case you know we um
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
here especially for me in my practice
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh we intend as a for-profit business to
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
compete with the larger mental health
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
centers and other larger uh facilities
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
in this state and if that's undercut
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
here by the state by passing such
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislation we won't be able to compete
 
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:03.910 align:start position:0%
legislation we won't be able to compete
and

02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
grow and expand
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're not a group of
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are just academic and
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
part-time take on a client or two and
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
make ourselves feel good
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
we're actually trying to do uh the best
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
we can for our community uh by treating
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
and using uh as many resources as we can
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
to reach as many people as we can for
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
example with telehealth expansion i've
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
had to buy an emr that supports hipaa
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
compliant telehealth services but with
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
that i'm able to see clients that are in
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
the lakes region while i'm in my office
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
in nashua uh we've been able to expand
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
access to rural
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
folks in our state uh that may have not
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
been able to access that from their
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
local mental health centers who have
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous wait list uh we also take
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
amerihealth and new hampshire healthy
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
families uh uh already compared to our
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh the private insurance companies that
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
we um contract with uh who are not only
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
just reimbursing at a full rate they are
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
also um
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
paying for the co-pays of um the private
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
practitioner private clients that come
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
through um if we uh pass a bill uh that
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
is being proposed even as amended uh i
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
for sure see um medicaid uh contractors
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
reducing our telehealth uh benefit uh
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh with that said uh i i do think again
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have to con consider the
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
self-employed and the small businesses
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
here that don't have such great
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining uh power as the larger
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh thank you for your time mr

02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%

uh thanks so much for allowing me to
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
participate today and good morning from
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
snowy southern new hampshire
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
my name is dr kristen johnson i'm
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
speaking as a resident of new fields and
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
as a practicing board certified
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
pediatrician from exeter i've spoken to
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
this committee in the past and see some
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
familiar faces
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
on specifically about telemedicine most
 
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.430 align:start position:0%
on specifically about telemedicine most
recently

02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the last year or two on expanding the
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
definition of originating sites to
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
include schools
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
over the past year
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
the kobit 19 pandemic has certainly
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
pushed telemedicine as we've heard into
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
the mainstream as healthcare was forced
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
to use creativity to balance the
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
healthcare needs of our community with
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
the stressors of reducing close contact
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
as a transmission risk factor for some
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
families with high risk health
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
conditions this risk reduction has
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
continued in dramatic fashion
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
in addition we've seen changes to the
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
daily routines
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
for adults and children students are
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing uh in person hybrid and remote
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
learning and we just heard from our
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative that his daughter's
 
02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
stealing his computer back uh parents
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
are working remotely
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
as all of you are uh here today uh but
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
also many are returning to their
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
in-person jobs this uh balance has been
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult for families including
 
02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
very difficult for families including
mine

02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
mine
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
and adding in healthcare has been a real
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
challenge this is true for both routine
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
well and chronic care as well as more
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
urgent and emerging issues
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
in our practice in pediatrics in exeter
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
with core we've worked to find a balance
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
of keeping our patients in quarantine
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
yet not having them miss out on their
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
medical care telemedicine has been a
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
critical part of this we've had students
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
learning from home and parents back at
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
work in person a three-way telemedicine
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
visit has provided access to care for
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
that student
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the parents can participate from
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
work as well and really allowing
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in that family to uh
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
participate in that healthcare
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
children with potentially uh having
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
coveted symptoms can be seen from home
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
if they're otherwise feeling okay
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we're offering testing without them
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
even having to leave their car that
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
limits the contact with others in our
 
02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
limits the contact with others in our
office

02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
as well as adding convenience for our
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
patients and parents maintaining a
 
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
healthy staff as i'm sure you guys are
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
all very aware has been one of the
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
challenges in keeping our healthcare
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
system uh open and this format has
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
really helped to stabilize the health of
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
our workforce
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
examples of these visits from my
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
practice just yesterday included a
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
family reviewing their child's anxiety
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
and adhd medication management from home
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
since there's an infant in their family
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
with congenital heart disease and
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
they're trying to limit their exposures
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
a teen with depression who is able to
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
talk to me from their bedroom
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
in a comfortable setting talking about
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
some pretty difficult topics for them
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh and a child who met with me from home
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
while the parent was at work um the
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
video was used for the child mom
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't get her video to work it was
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
only available by audio and i realized
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
we've taken some of that component out
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
but again just as an example uh a few
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
things that have required uh
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
telemedicine just the last 24 hours for
 
02:07:02.639 --> 02:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
telemedicine just the last 24 hours for
me

02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh this pandemic has brought many awful
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
things but what we have learned about
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is one of the bright spots
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh in our learning today in the
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
snowstorm we'll we'll have less
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
disruption to the care of our patients
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
as we can keep them off our slippery
 
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.030 align:start position:0%
as we can keep them off our slippery
roads

02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
roads
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
yet allow them to keep their planned
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
care well telemedicine as we've heard is
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not appropriate for all
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
situations it has allowed us to be more
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
agile during this pandemic and to
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that to other situations
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
snowstorms kids and parents in separate
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
locations poor access to transportation
 
02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:34.229 align:start position:0%
locations poor access to transportation
etc

02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
payment for telemedicine has been an
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing challenge until this pandemic
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
accelerated the payment equity in the
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
setting of the state emergency and the
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of access to telemedicine are
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
clear in the correct setting and with
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
equal payment being critical to
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
supporting ongoing access i oppose house
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill 602 changing the payments for these
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
visits they should continue to follow
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
the now standard billing for medic for
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't spoken much to it but the
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
new 2021 billing structure
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
has really changed
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
our day-to-day billing and really
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on the time spent with patients
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
on their coordinated care on the time
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
for documentation
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the other work that we do to care
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
for our patients in this format really
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
supports the equal payment for time with
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
less focus on the components of physical
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
exam and physical presence certainly
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
supporting the care is care and that the
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
location of our patient and our provider
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
are not as critical in our new
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of our federal health care
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
payment system
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
previous legislation
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
passed by
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
you guys here in new hampshire
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
requiring medicaid and medicare to pay
 
02:08:35.599 --> 02:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
requiring medicaid and medicare to pay
for

02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:08:36.719 --> 02:08:38.470 align:start position:0%
for
telemedicine

02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
it wasn't paid for at all before this
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
we never were reimbursed
 
02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:44.629 align:start position:0%
we never were reimbursed
and

02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
typically what we see is that our
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
private insurances follow the lead of
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
the state medicaid and medicare
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
populations and what you choose to do to
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
support that
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
my opposition of this bill um is both in
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
its initial and modified form
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can maintain uh moving
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
forward with adequate payment for the
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
advantageous progress that we're making
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of our location of
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
services uh thank you for your time and
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'll submit a formal copy of that by
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
email and i'm happy to answer questions
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
if i could be helpful

the parties who agreed to that
legislation

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
were

02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
the department of hhs and the medicaid
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
services the department of insurance
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
so you can you can see we uh we not only
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support we had uh
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
broad support from uh state agencies
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
i want to say i've worked with
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative edwards on a number of
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills uh uh we've had uh good
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh colleague
 
02:11:24.630 --> 02:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
relationships uh and
 
02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
relationships uh and
[Music]

02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when it comes to this bill
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm speaking today in opposition to
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh look forward to working with
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative edwards in the future on
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
things in which we have mutual interest
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
but on this
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
i think this is a very poorly timed bill
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was created in
 
02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was created in
the

02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1623 passage last year was
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
the creation of a commission to study
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
telehealth services
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
i serve on that as the chairperson
 
02:12:00.079 --> 02:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
i serve on that as the chairperson
and

02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
serving on that commission
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
14-member commission with me
 
02:12:06.639 --> 02:12:07.589 align:start position:0%
14-member commission with me
are

02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative dr woods
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
and representative dr marsh
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
they both have a great deal to
 
02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
they both have a great deal to
contribute

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
along with the other
 
02:12:18.159 --> 02:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
along with the other
11

02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
11
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
members of the commission who represent
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
all the groups that i said we had come
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
together you heard from dj betancourt
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance has been
 
02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance has been
engaged

02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
engaged
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
through tyler brennan
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
who's working
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the study committee
 
02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.629 align:start position:0%
with the study committee
um

02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
we were scratching the surface let me
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
let me also add that the study
 
02:12:43.199 --> 02:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
let me also add that the study
commission

02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
in its enabling
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
legislation has two reporting dates
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
the first is
 
02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.430 align:start position:0%
the first is
for

02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
december 1st of 2022
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
the second is
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
december 1st of 2024
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
at which time the commission would
 
02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:05.830 align:start position:0%
at which time the commission would
sunset

02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
sunset
uh

02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
the idea that the parties who came
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
together to to
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
was that we need to get past this
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic and see what the adoption rate
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh post
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic actually is for the uses of
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
telemedicine telehealth
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
and and establish some baseline
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
data uh we started to scratch the
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
surface on data
 
02:13:37.679 --> 02:13:38.470 align:start position:0%
surface on data
uh

02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
it's uh
the

02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
uh
medicaid

02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
allows us to look at private insurers
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
what we can observe is that the
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
information lags uh in order to to get
 
02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.270 align:start position:0%
information lags uh in order to to get
good

02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh breakdowns on the uses and
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursements by category of use
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh takes uh as much as six months to
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
be in a reportable format the point
 
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
be in a reportable format the point
being

02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
our december 22nd report is probably
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to reflect on usage up until
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
the summer
of

02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
of
2022

02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
2022
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
which isn't a whole lot
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
long way off uh hopefully we have a
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
year's worth of non-covet-related
 
02:14:37.119 --> 02:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
year's worth of non-covet-related
experience

02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we can compare to the pandemic
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
crisis use
 
02:14:42.639 --> 02:14:43.669 align:start position:0%
crisis use
uh

02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
but that that we'll see that down the
 
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
but that that we'll see that down the
road

02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
road
 
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.830 align:start position:0%
road
um

02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
we know that the adoption rates in
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
health care delivery it's slow i come
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
they compete neck and neck for
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
change in their their practices
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
parity is an important part to encourage
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
this market to evolve uh the study
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
commission's role
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh is to look at that to solicit
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
information from health care providers
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
on their use
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
from commercial payers from medicaid
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh and uh from uh users patient uh uh
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
data to to see how well it's worked for
 
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.350 align:start position:0%
data to to see how well it's worked for
patients

02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh and to determine if there are
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh cost structures that perhaps are
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
different for
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
types of services
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
that might be offered under telehealth
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
but we don't have that evidence today
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i guess if there's any overused term
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
in today's pandemic healthcare
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
environment it is let's do this on an
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
manner and uh
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
and let that evolve and and please use
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
the study commission uh as a means of
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
reporting as it is intended to the
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
this committee and in the senate
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the governor and uh
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
let us use this commission
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
as it was written
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
to to be a
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
a means for consolidating evidence-based
 
02:16:28.239 --> 02:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
a means for consolidating evidence-based
practice

02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
and cost evidence
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
to bring forward to the legislature in
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
an appropriate time when we've got
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to do so
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you senator khan i was really
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
hoping you would sign in on this because
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
of your work on that commission i just
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
thought i i thought i had okay well i'm
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
glad you did i didn't see it until about
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
10 minutes ago
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
but thank you and i do have one question
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
for you uh if we were to retain the bill
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
we would be working on it in september
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
and october
 
02:16:59.439 --> 02:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
and october
um

02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
if we itled the bill something would
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh put into the hopper we'd look at it
 
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
next january or february in your
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
personal opinion in terms of the lag of
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
knowing the data
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
would our working on it in september
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
october be sufficiently far out
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
for us to come up with some really good
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
conclusions or would those good
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
conclusions better wait a year
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think your latter point mr chairman is
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh more accurate i think
 
02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh more accurate i think
uh

02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
you'll still be looking at
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh
 
02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.709 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh
months

02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:17:42.719 --> 02:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
months
uh

02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:44.950 align:start position:0%
uh
data

02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to to bring the data
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
current to
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh your considerations in the fall
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that i am going to
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing on this and i will be

possibly can
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore anyone who then wishes to
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%

i'm in support of that
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
we need audio only telehealth because of
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
situations like this
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
you got it and can't discuss that out
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
you can't discuss the bill
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill is due to the wind did that take
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
you down
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know i would have to plow out my
 
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
driveway and then drive down the road
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
and see but yeah hosted telephone and
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
the internet i know it's the cable and
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
fortunately the electricity hasn't gone
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
out so
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
but this does seem to happen on a
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
the it is really heavy on the wires and
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%

pregnancy
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
this bill was inspired by an article
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
published in jama june 18 2019 entitled
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
association between self-reported
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
prenatal cannabis use and maternal
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
perinatal and neonatal outcomes
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
briefly a cohort study of over 660 000
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancies in ontario canada found the
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
rate of preterm birth among reported
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis users was 12 percent versus 6
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
percent and non-users a statistically
 
02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
significant difference clearly that's

neither good for the babies nor the
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
health insurers
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
this confirmed a previously reported
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
study from colorado in the journal
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
pediatrics in 2018.
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
meanwhile a june 2018 study in
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
obstetrics gynecology reported that a
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
survey of 400 cannabis dispensaries in
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
colorado found 69 percent of them
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
recommending cannabis for first
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
trimester morning sickness
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
my survey of available medical
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
literature about this was made much
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
simpler by our surgeon general jerome
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
adams who issued an advisory on
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%

02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to the concern about
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
pre-term births dr adams is rightly
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about subsequent learning

www.hhs.gov and look at the report
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
if and when i get my computer back i'll
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
be glad to email you a link to the
 
02:27:31.359 --> 02:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
be glad to email you a link to the
report

02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
after i filed this bill last year abby
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
rogers from dhhs contacted me and asked
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
me to expand its scope slightly to
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
include cannabis use while lactating and
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
the risk of accidental poisoning and i
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
redrafted the bill with their language i
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
similarly did so this year after filing
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
there are two difference between this
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill and last year's bill
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1591 last year passed this
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
committee 18 to nothing and was adopted
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
on consent but died a covet death in the
 
02:28:01.359 --> 02:28:02.230 align:start position:0%
on consent but died a covet death in the
senate

02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
we added language about cannabis use
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
during adolescence to reflect the
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
surgeon general's concern
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
and we asked the department to document
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
through rules that counseling had
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
happened that could be as simple as a
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
check box on the certification form
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
the entire effect of this bill is to
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
acquire conspicuous warnings be posted
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
and information be made available
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
mirroring that that's currently being
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
made available in colorado work is
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
already being done on educational
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
materials which i believe representative
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
canark intends to share i thank you and
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you mr chair and uh
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
good morning representative marsh thank
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um this is
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
obviously a no-brainer
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
but the question i have is
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
are we getting into the situation where
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to just be adding
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
bits of of health information here and
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
there where we should maybe take a step
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
back and create a process of
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
communicating from
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
the um hhs to the individual patients
 
02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.150 align:start position:0%
the um hhs to the individual patients
now

02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
they they do send out letters and so
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
forth but there's no they don't have
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
email lists and so forth
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's also seen um
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
as as security
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues of of not wanting to be exposed
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
as taking part in the program but i just
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if we are going to keep
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
encountering these um these medical
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
bulletins and so putting them in into
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
the law one by one
 
02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.429 align:start position:0%
the law one by one
seems

02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
seems
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know self-defeating where we could
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
create a system where
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know that handles
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit differently
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'm i'm glad
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
for your question um
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
i i would like things like this to
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
happen automatically but as we know
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
things happen when the squeak when the
 
02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
wheel squeaks and we were told last year
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
that the department had been meaning to
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
get around to doing this for about five
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
years and hadn't quite done it
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think you and i both recognize that at
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
some point in time it is highly likely
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
that our state will join the states
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
around us and make uh cannabis more
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
widely available to the public and i
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
will admit that one of my intentions
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
here was to have the department develop
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
materials so that when that day comes
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
they could more widely distribute their
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
materials but that would be a different
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill for a different day
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is just to require the
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
materials to be developed for the
 
02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:46.389 align:start position:0%
materials to be developed for the
dispensaries

02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
how many ways do we have to notify the
 
02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.429 align:start position:0%
how many ways do we have to notify the
public

02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:30:59.439 --> 02:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
public
um

02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
it is a no-brainer but it's a no-brainer
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
to us
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately in our culture there
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
are lots of people who just don't want
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
to think there's anything negative about
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
using cannabis
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
so we've already discussed a bill
 
02:31:19.359 --> 02:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
so we've already discussed a bill
about

02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
about using cannabis for medical
 
02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.270 align:start position:0%
about using cannabis for medical
purposes

02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
which i'm guessing
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to being pregnant
 
02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.349 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to being pregnant
so

02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know this to me seems like a really
 
02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
you know this to me seems like a really
basic

02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
basic
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
basic way to say that it's extremely
 
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous and if we're going to talk
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
about marijuana at all
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
this ought to be part of it
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh and it is you know in my book it is
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
affected tremendously by
 
02:31:51.439 --> 02:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
affected tremendously by
uh

02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
by the law
 
02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
by the law
so

02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
how many other ways can we tell people
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
this just seems like one really critical
 
02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
this just seems like one really critical
way

02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
question i do believe that the
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
department intends to testify on this
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
bill they did on our bill last year
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that they can answer that
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
question far better than i can so i will
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
let them do so
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
i commend this bill i think it's a step
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the right direction um i would
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
actually go a step farther if we could
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
when i look at other
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
things available to us in the
 
02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
things available to us in the
marketplace

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
to protect the unborn
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we put labels on nicotine we put
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
labels on to alcohol particularly
 
02:32:44.479 --> 02:32:45.670 align:start position:0%
labels on to alcohol particularly
alcohol

02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think this is a step as far as
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
informing the person in the dispensary
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
was there any thought put into adding a
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
label onto the product itself once it
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
leaves the dispensary versus just being
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
inside of the dispensaries
 
02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.150 align:start position:0%
inside of the dispensaries
uh

02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
question i think the issue of labeling
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
of product is an important question and
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
in fact i happen to know that there's a
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill before the commerce committee to
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
that effect uh but that's not the bill
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing here today and it
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
never crossed my mind to put labels uh
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
on it when i wrote this bill but i agree
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
with you that it's a very reasonable
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
idea and i would suggest you address
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
your comments to the commerce committee
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative jerry kanerk
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
is a co-sponsor and has done a lot of
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
work on this subject and i would like to
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
invite him to testify on this bill
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair everybody hear me
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay yep
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay um yes for the record i'm
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative jerry connerk and
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
representing carol iii but i also serve
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
this is the board that is tasked with
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
looking over the medical issues involved
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic cannabis program we
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
heard about the other board that we've
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
already voted to get rid of and because
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
that had to do with just kind of the
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
function and getting it up and running
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing board to look at
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
medical questions
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
so we have actually been dealing with
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
this for over a year now
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
first i have to point out that one
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
important thing is that the surgeon
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
general's report
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
had to do with cannabis in general
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
not just therapeutic cannabis he was
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
talking about recreational and
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and the great majority of
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
users who are pregnant or adolescents
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
are actually recreational users
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the data regarding cannabis risk
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
that we have so far to use to make
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
decisions actually comes from the
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
recreational users as the therapeutic
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis literature is just emerging the
 
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
risks in therapeutic use may be
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
different than in recreational use due
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
to the different patterns and the
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
different dosage having said that
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
we still share the concerns
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
so it's important to understand that the
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
goal of using cannabis in the
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic setting is different from
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the goal in recreational use
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's not used to get high but instead to
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
treat a condition the doses of
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis are titrated using
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
rubric that we call
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
low and slow you start with a low dose
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
and you slowly build to achieve the
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic effect while minimizing the
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
side effect of euphoria
 
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
it is important to understand that the
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
peak ages for certified patients in the
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
tcmob sorry the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
program in new hampshire is in the 50s
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the 60s that's the age group
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
for a 2021 senate bill we just
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
interrogated the database regarding the
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
number of certified patients less than
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
age 21.
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
25 is in this bill but 21 was the other
 
02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:40.309 align:start position:0%
25 is in this bill but 21 was the other
that's

02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
how we interrogate it
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:43.870 align:start position:0%
out of
10

02:35:43.870 --> 02:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
10
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
688 total qualifying patients in the
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program in new
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire there are only 10 minors under
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
age 18
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and 66 patients between 18 and 20. so it
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
is actually also a fairly small group
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't take away the importance
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
the tcmv tcmob has not had the chance to
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
review this particular view it's on our
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
agenda for tomorrow
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
we did review the 2020 version of the
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1591 which addressed pregnancy
 
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
and lactation
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
but did not include this section in
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
adolescence and we voted to support the
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill 9-1 with an initial recommendation
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
to add a requirement for counseling by
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
both the atc and the certifying provider
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
for all women of child varying age about
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
the risk of cannabis during pregnancy
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
and lactation
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
the next month though we revisited our
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this and we then expressed
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with each other about the at
 
02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:39.670 align:start position:0%
concerns with each other about the at
staff

02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
atc staff that's remember atc's are the
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
dispensaries about the staff
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
qualifications to provide such
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
counseling and also difficulties with
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
gender determination and profiling of
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
women of child-bearing age
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
we realized that asking the atc to
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
provide the counseling about
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
risk of cannabis in women in
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
childbearing age would actually hold
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis perhaps to a higher
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
standard than we do with other drugs in
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy so we felt that actually we
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
would not support
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
the counseling and the atc but we felt
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
the counseling did belong in the
 
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
certifying provider's office
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the main goals for the for the
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
board in 2020 was to develop educational
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
materials we have already developed
 
02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
educational sheets regarding the risks
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
of cannabis use during pregnancy and
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
lactation both for providers
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
and for patients and we're ready to
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
proceed with the implementation of these
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
educational initiatives
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
now i sent to you when i sent this
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
testimony to you a couple of days ago i
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
included those information sheets again
 
02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've approved the content that's the
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
kind of content we expect would be used
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
in some of the informational and
 
02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
educational work we work on
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative martial included a
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirement for counseling in the new
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill placing the burden of counseling on
 
02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
the certifying provider which is where
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
we feel it should be
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
we have not reviewed this particular
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
language but given that we've already
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
agreed with the counseling being done by
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the certifying provider i'm pretty sure
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be happy with this
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the new bill also has a requirement for
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
warnings of the risk of cannabis in
 
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.349 align:start position:0%
warnings of the risk of cannabis in
adolescence

02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
adolescence
 
02:38:12.790 --> 02:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
though we have not had a chance to
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
discuss that particular requirement in
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
the context of the language of this bill
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have discussed and recognized the
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
risks of cannabis use in adolescence and
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
we have already developed educational
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
slides for providers regarding these
 
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
slides for providers regarding these
risks

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
risks
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that educational slide deck was also
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
attached to the email i sent you a
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
couple of days ago
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
you also may note uh late last night i
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
sent an email that had um
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
pdfs of some of these then of the more
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
detailed educational decks
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
and those included some posters and
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
other types of educational materials
 
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
used in some other states that gives you
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
an idea what representative mark should
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
be talking about with this bill that
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
he's discussing
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i would expect that tcmob will
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably support this new section of the
 
02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:58.630 align:start position:0%
probably support this new section of the
bill

02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
and will develop educational materials
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
for the risks of cannabis use and
 
02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.070 align:start position:0%
for the risks of cannabis use and
adolescence

02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
adolescence
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
now a couple of things that i did have
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
some questions about
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the reconstant requirement on page
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
two line seven
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be amended so on the
 
02:39:13.439 --> 02:39:14.230 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be amended so on the
bill

02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
page two line seven because it talks
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
about counseling for women of child
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
bearing age in adolescents 25 years or
 
02:39:20.319 --> 02:39:21.190 align:start position:0%
bearing age in adolescents 25 years or
less

02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
we would need to say counseling for
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
patients less than age 18 needs to
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
include the parent or the guardian
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
just for the usual issues we do in
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
medical care the
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
patient should be counseled but in this
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
case probably a parent and guardian as
 
02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:35.190 align:start position:0%
case probably a parent and guardian as
well

02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
i also though question whether the
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
specific risks should be prescribed in
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute this is done if we look at page
 
02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.710 align:start position:0%
statute this is done if we look at page
2

02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
2
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
lines 13 to 14
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
and lines 22 to 25
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
that identifies which risks need to be
 
02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:50.309 align:start position:0%
that identifies which risks need to be
enumerated

02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
enumerated
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
but we do know that medical knowledge
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
evolves over time
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps the decision of the risks to be
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
included should be made by the tcmob
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
i would say though that we are
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
our lists are almost identical so we
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
have no difficulty with that sorry i
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
cannot say we here we have now looked at
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
the new language i do not and i do not
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
expect that board would have difficulty
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
with the language of the risks that are
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
used but the question is do we want it
 
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
scalable for the future by keeping out
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh details that might change over
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
time with changing medical knowledge
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
regarding representative gay's question
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
we are working to disseminate this
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
information to providers and to the
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
patients for the patients a handout
 
02:40:32.319 --> 02:40:33.429 align:start position:0%
patients for the patients a handout
also

02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
a poster we would agree with that
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
concept that's in this bill
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
and also again because of the counseling
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
required um we would be very happy if
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
the pro if the certifying provider
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh did also review these issues so i am
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
quite sure that we will agree with this
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill since we agreed with last year's
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
nine to one but we have not had a time
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
to go over the exact language that's
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank you
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canuck and
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
before i recognize anyone to ask you
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
questions i see that representative
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
casey conley is on the call and
 
02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative conley it is my intent to
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
move right into your bill after this one
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i hope it won't be very long so
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
hang in there brother
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:23.110 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
woods

02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mark for taking
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
i remember those papers and read them
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
when they came out but i don't recall
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
the content the cbd versus thc
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
the reason i ask we know that
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
the cbd part uh can be quite useful
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
medically uh i.e in the um
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
newborn and the very young with seizure
 
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
newborn and the very young with seizure
disorders

02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
02:41:55.270 --> 02:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
um has that was that parsed out and i
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
think it's probably important to know
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
because we've uh have bills and we have
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually standalone
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
companies now
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh selling just cbds and that would be
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
helpful to be able to provide that
 
02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
helpful to be able to provide that
information

02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
do were those uh studies
 
02:42:12.399 --> 02:42:13.270 align:start position:0%
do were those uh studies
uh

02:42:13.270 --> 02:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.190 --> 02:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
to whom are you addressing your question
 
02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
to whom are you addressing your question
um

02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
to uh representative marsh or uh
 
02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
to uh representative marsh or uh
knurk

02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
i just don't recall the paper
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh they might and i think it's important
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
to make that we can differentiate
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
do you ever tell me to take that
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh well i would just say to the best of
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
my recollection it wasn't addressed but
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
since i can't look up the paper because
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
my computer's down
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
i can't really answer it well
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
point of order mr chairman i think it
 
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
would be simpler for all of us trying to
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
follow along at home
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
if only the person who is currently
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
testifying is asked questions and we
 
02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't switch between the person who's
 
02:43:01.270 --> 02:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
currently on
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the batter's box
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
go further afield
 
02:43:07.270 --> 02:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and that would be
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay well i'd i'd be glad to i'd be glad
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
to speak to that
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
are you can you hear me i'm not
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
highlighted there we are okay now i am
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
um basically again as i said earlier
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
most of the data we have regarding
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis sorry regarding
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis risks comes from the
 
02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:26.389 align:start position:0%
cannabis risks comes from the
uh

02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
from the recreational field and the
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
whole point with recreational is most
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
the time it's really not regulated most
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
the time we don't really know and most
 
02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
the studies that we've looked at don't
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
separate those out we are just finally
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
getting some studies relating to just
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
cbd you are correct cbd has very
 
02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
distinct uses and is actually approved
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
as epidiolex for seizure disorders
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
but we still do not have enough data to
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
let us know whether or not
 
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
let us know whether or not
one

02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
strain is released that much safer than
 
02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
the other strain so it's still the data
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
is in its infancy but most of these have
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
to do with recreational use and as a
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
result it's usually the standard which
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
canarch

02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair recognizes michael
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh hello this is michael holt can you
 
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
hear me we can
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
my name is michael holt i'm representing
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
services i am i am the administrator of
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the department's therapeutic cannabis
 
02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:45.269 align:start position:0%
the department's therapeutic cannabis
program

02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
was not taking a position on this bill
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i would offer that uh representative
 
02:44:52.790 --> 02:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
knurk stole much of my uh testimonial
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
thunder um his points were exactly going
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be my point so i won't reiterate uh
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
except um
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
too much except to say that
 
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
much of what this bill is mandating is
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
already being done either required by
 
02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:08.070 align:start position:0%
already being done either required by
statute

02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
administrative rule or practice
 
02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
some of the differences are this
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
information needs to be provided in
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
poster format
 
02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:16.950 align:start position:0%
poster format
um

02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
the uh and the other main point that i
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
would make is that um
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
i share the department shares the
 
02:45:25.349 --> 02:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
concern of codifying
 
02:45:25.359 --> 02:45:26.309 align:start position:0%
concern of codifying
um

02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
these health risks in statute um
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis science is evolving we don't
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
want to lock ourselves in and that the
 
02:45:37.590 --> 02:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
tcmob the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
02:45:42.309 --> 02:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
will be taking a review of this bill up
 
02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
at tomorrow's uh tomorrow's meeting um
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the department would like to see these
 
02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.429 align:start position:0%
the department would like to see these
um

02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:50.550 align:start position:0%
um
these

02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
this list of health
 
02:45:52.399 --> 02:45:53.830 align:start position:0%
this list of health
adolescents

02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
either be vetted by the board first or
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
removed from
 
02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.070 align:start position:0%
removed from
shoot

02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
shoot
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
entirely and let the board direct us and
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
the atcs on what information should be
 
02:46:06.319 --> 02:46:07.590 align:start position:0%
the atcs on what information should be
provided

02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:08.469 align:start position:0%
provided
to

02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
patients um
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
via providers and the alternative
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
 
02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:18.070 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
um

02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
so uh that's uh i'll close just by
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
highlighting the the numbers again um
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
total patience um 10 688 uh we've got 10
 
02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
miners on the program uh we have
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
310 adolescents uh so age 18 to 25
 
02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh so the scope of this uh
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
population is relatively small um women
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
of reproductive age is estimated to be
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
about um under 1500 patients um enrolled
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
from from members
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative knight did most of the
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
lifting on this one
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr holt
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
holster taking my question i i was
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
wondering can you give me a ballpark
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
figure of how many
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh medical
 
02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
providers there are that have
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
taken part or recommended uh cannabis to
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
their patients uh that's that's one part
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
of the equation i know how many people
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
we got how many doctors we have out
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
there taking part
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh we collect this data um
 
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
we have about 1200
 
02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
we have about 1200
providers

02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
who have certified at least one patient
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the current number
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's not the number of total providers
 
02:47:39.279 --> 02:47:40.309 align:start position:0%
that's not the number of total providers
who

02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
may have certified one patient a number
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
of years ago but no longer have a
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
current patient so that's about 1200
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
providers um about uh
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
memory says uh close to 200 of those
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
are upstate providers so about a
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
thousand in-state providers and about
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
200 out-of-state providers those
 
02:48:03.870 --> 02:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
provider types are physicians
 
02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:05.590 align:start position:0%
provider types are physicians
aprns

aprns
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
and as of a couple years ago physician
 
02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.429 align:start position:0%
and as of a couple years ago physician
assistants

02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
those are the provider types who can
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much that's
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
impressive numbers

thank you
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%

02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
chris
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
hello representative uh mr hall i have
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
two questions thank you for taking my
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
question and thank you mr chairman i
 
02:48:42.550 --> 02:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
have two questions you said that the
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
information can only be presented in a
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
poster form
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the end of the bill it says brochures
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that preclude producing a brochure
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
my testimony was that
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
much of this information that is
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
required by this bill is already being
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
provided by the atc's uh in other
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
formats this bill would require
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
specifically a warning poster to be
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
posted in the dispensary on these two
 
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
issues that was the testimony that i
 
02:49:21.429 --> 02:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
provided okay but that same information
 
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
could be produced in a brochure that
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
could be distributed elsewhere is that
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
not correct are correct
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
we uh we currently uh do have a
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
brochure if you will a double-sided
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
color copy um that has information about
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
the program that includes info warnings
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
about use during pregnancy and while
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding um and also information
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
about safe storage disposal and
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
accidental poisoning this information is
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
already in brochure form um we do not
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
have require um
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh big posters to be posted in uh in the
 
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
dispensaries at the time that's going to
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
be a cost for the department to develop
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
and print um of course um
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's not uh it's an issue that
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about in the in the
 
02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
tcmob meeting tomorrow um but again uh
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the information on adolescents is
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
not being currently provided um in any
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
format um so that is a that's a good
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
addition to this uh to be able to focus
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
um education efforts on that population
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr holt seeing no

oh he did it
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
good man members of the committee my
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
name is kate frye from new futures uh
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see you all virtually um as
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're a non-partisan nonprofit
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
organization that educates and advocates
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
to improve the health and wellness of
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
02:50:58.640 --> 02:50:59.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
um

02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
and we are here in support of house bill
 
02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
16163 relative to cannabis use during
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
pregnancy as representative marsh had
 
02:51:11.349 --> 02:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
stated there was a jama article that
 
02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
showed the proportion of u.s women using
 
02:51:15.910 --> 02:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um cannabis during pregnancy more than
 
02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
double between 2002 and 2017
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we all know use during pregnancy can
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
be harmful um to a baby's health and
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
include many serious problems
 
02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
include many serious problems
um

02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
we support hb 1633 because it would
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
require the atcs to pry to provide
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
information regarding the risk of
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis use so i will agree with
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative marsh that this has been
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
about a five year discussion um new
 
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
futures along with prevention partners
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
created very easy to use educational
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
documents for the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
program and for the atc's back in 2016.
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think those are still the forms that
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
repre uh might mr holt refer to
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
um these documents highlight tips for
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
safe and responsible use child safety
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
and preventing youth use
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
and it was a collaborative effort with
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
the atcs and dhhs and prevention experts
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
however it's always been unclear whether
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
they are actually being used
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
by the atcs and kind of after four or
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
five years of these discussions
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
we are advocating we do think it makes
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
sense to mandate these efforts um and we
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
would also recommend that these
 
02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
documents are mailed to clients when
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
they receive their therapeutic cannabis
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
id card it'd be a relatively easy thing
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do um i'm not this could be done
 
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
already i haven't had a discussion with
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
the department in quite some time about
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
this but they're um it's just an eight
 
02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
by eleven um piece of paper that could
 
02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
easily be included by
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh with the um cannabis identification
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
card um as far as the cost goes my
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is the governor's
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
commission on substance misuse um
 
02:52:56.479 --> 02:52:57.590 align:start position:0%
commission on substance misuse um
actually

02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
um set aside ten thousand dollars to
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
cover the costs for this for the
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
division of public health services
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
because um it was being said over and
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
over again that the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
program couldn't cover the cost so i'm
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
not sure why um this would be an
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
additional cost to the um
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things i just wanted to
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
state too is um again i'm split my
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
testimony specific to the part of the
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill is cannabis use during pregnancy um
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agreed with representative
 
02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
gay that um it's a no-brainer but it
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually makes sense with prevention
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
efforts sometimes you have to say the
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
same message over and over again for
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
folks to hear it so i think it makes
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
even more sense that
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
these this information is right in the
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
fingertips of folks when they receive
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
the id or when they go into the atc
 
02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:53.830 align:start position:0%
the id or when they go into the atc
um

02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
and again we wouldn't advocate that you
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to have a big shiny poster again we
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
think you could easily put this
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
information um in the card and have
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
these available at the atcs and again
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't not everybody can walk
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
into an actual alternative treatment
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
center you have to have a card it is
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
unclear whether or not they are
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
um so it i think um mandating it does
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
um i will just touch on i wasn't going
 
02:54:26.469 --> 02:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
to speak to the part of the bill uh
 
02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
regarding adolescence use because
 
02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
honestly i just realized it was in the
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill but one thing i would mention is i
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
think you do need to be as proactive as
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
possible i definitely agree that you
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
should defer this to the
 
02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:40.309 align:start position:0%
should defer this to the
um

02:54:40.309 --> 02:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
clinical oversight board of which
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative connect does a good job
 
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
but i think we should look at what other
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
states are seeing too
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
once they have moved to recreational um
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh use i was actually on a call from
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
someone from colorado where right now
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
who we all know had therapeutic cannabis
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
for some years and then moved to
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
recreational they're seeing a huge jump
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
in the number of um 18 to 20 year olds
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
who have actually left just recreational
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
use and have gone to the medical side of
 
02:55:13.439 --> 02:55:15.750 align:start position:0%
use and have gone to the medical side of
things

02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
mostly under the condition of um pain
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
and those numbers jump from like 300 in
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
the age group of zero to 17 to 3 000 in
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
the group of 18 to 21 and they moved to
 
02:55:31.910 --> 02:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
this category because there are no taxes
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
and because the
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
they can get higher percentage thc
 
02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
they can get higher percentage thc
uh

02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
products so i just think we need to be
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
proactive if indeed we move in this
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
direction let's learn from other states
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
who are seeing this um even though you
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
know as representative uh connect said
 
02:55:52.870 --> 02:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
the cannabis um cbd is one thing thc is
 
02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
another thing um and the two different
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
programs are separate but these other
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
states are seeing people actually leave
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
kind of the recreational side and move
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
back to medical for um reasons that are
 
02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiary to them as far as um they
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay taxes so i just wanted
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
to bring that to your attention um
 
02:56:14.399 --> 02:56:16.309 align:start position:0%
to bring that to your attention um
and

02:56:16.309 --> 02:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
i think that covers it thank you miss
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
fry will you take questions absolutely
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
any questions for
ms

02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
fry

fry
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i unfortunately
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
got a phone call right when i was there
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i want to do a follow-up to my last
 
02:56:41.359 --> 02:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
and i want to do a follow-up to my last
question

02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
which is if this bill about
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis users to grow cannabis
 
02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.469 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis users to grow cannabis
themselves

02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
they would not be going to the
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
dispensaries is there any way we can get
 
02:56:57.269 --> 02:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
information to them with the same
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
warning about this that that they would
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
get if they walked into the uh
 
02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
dispensary and the second thing is
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
that i wondered about is uh
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
is it's probably two mammoths a job to
 
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
have anybody really undertake but it
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
does seem to me that family
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners and obstetricians should
 
02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
really have this information available
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
to them so i just wondered if mr uh halt
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
could answer those questions for me
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
mr halt has left the meeting this
 
02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:26.230 align:start position:0%
mr halt has left the meeting this
question

02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:29.830 --> 02:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
is only addressed to kate frye
 
02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:30.870 align:start position:0%
is only addressed to kate frye
okay

02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
and she can take the question or not if
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
she wishes
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
i will attempt to do my best i think
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
your first question is if um a home grow
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass and i'm only speaking
 
02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to um
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
this bill that is really pertinent to
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
just the alternative treatment centers
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
who um uh
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
are under the therapeutic cannabis law
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
um certainly if home grow passes that's
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
something that should be considered but
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
obviously that would be much harder to i
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
think regulate whereas the atc's it's a
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's um a lot easier so
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's just projection to look at
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
this point whether or not that makes
 
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
sense and so i'm just speaking to the
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
part of the bill today that addresses
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the atcs um regarding your question on
 
02:58:20.309 --> 02:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
um obgyn i think that's a great point i
 
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
mean please keep in mind that they don't
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
um prescribe they what they do is
 
02:58:25.439 --> 02:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
um prescribe they what they do is
certify

02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
certify
 
02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
what providers do is certify
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
i have had
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
numerous amount of conversations with ob
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
gyn who are just stunned you know how
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
many have um
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh asked them about the use of cannabis
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy and they try to provide
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
as much cost and much information as
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
possible around the risks and that there
 
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
are other options for medication for
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
things like um
 
02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
morning sickness so uh you know i think
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
they have uh
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have a genuine concern about how
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
they get this question over and over and
 
02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
over again and so that's enough to for
 
02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
me to think that there needs to be some
 
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
kind of warning information out there
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much there are no further
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
questions for uh this testifier uh is
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
nancy sheridan from the public still on
 
02:59:25.030 --> 02:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
he is not
 
02:59:28.790 --> 02:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh she is one of my constituents she was
 
02:59:31.349 --> 02:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
on for 602 which brings up a question
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
are you planning to go back to 602 today
 
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
or some other day
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
it will have to be some other day
 
02:59:39.110 --> 02:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
because it will have to be announced
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
fine thank you um
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who is from the
 
02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:45.590 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who is from the
public

02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.439 --> 02:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
being answered it seems in the negative
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask representative marsh
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
would your pleasure be
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
to uh move to exec this bill
 
03:00:06.389 --> 03:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
or in light of
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative canark's statements on
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
two different items on page two would
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
you like us just to adjourn this uh
 
03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
you like us just to adjourn this uh
hearing

03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
and execute in a couple of weeks after
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
more information has come in
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
well i believe you could execute fairly
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
soon because representative knurk if his
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee recommends some changes they
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
sound to me like they would be friendly
 
03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendments and we could just introduce
 
03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
those after his meeting tomorrow so
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
i would be content to wait for that i
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it necessarily has to wait
 
03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a couple of days i don't see any
 
03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
urgency towards our passing the spill so
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
i don't feel we need to execute at this
 
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
time okay good thank you that was my
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
guess but i wanted to give that as a
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
courtesy to you
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
i closed the hearing on house bill 163
 
03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
and we move to
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
now open the hearing on house bill 240
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
relative to identification of cannabis
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
strain for therapeutic cannabis and the
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative casey
 
03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:12.550 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative casey
conley

03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman committee members
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
i am casey conway state representative
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
from dover
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh here to introduce hb 240.
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow therapy excuse me
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis dispensaries to use
 
03:01:29.590 --> 03:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
the name of the specific cannabis
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
strains when dispensing them to clients
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
these names would be used both inside
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
those dispensaries to identify uh the
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the packaging that uh
 
03:01:41.590 --> 03:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
patients would leave with
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and on dispensary websites when
 
03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:45.349 align:start position:0%
um and on dispensary websites when
identifying

03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh inventory and so on
 
03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is fixes an issue in
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
our therapeutic cannabis rules
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
that prohibit strain names from being
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
used like this
 
03:01:58.950 --> 03:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
currently they are represented by
 
03:02:01.429 --> 03:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
initials and shorthand
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
and while that might seem simple enough
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
it can get confusing quickly
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
a quick look at the temescal wellness
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
dispensary in dover last night showed a
 
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
healthy assortment of cannabis strains
 
03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:14.710 align:start position:0%
healthy assortment of cannabis strains
available

03:02:14.710 --> 03:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
these include something called bdr prj
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
gba prj or even ac prj
 
03:02:26.550 --> 03:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
and if those weren't satisfactory
 
03:02:28.230 --> 03:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's bbk
 
03:02:32.309 --> 03:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
sd plus and srd
 
03:02:33.670 --> 03:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't know about you but i have no
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
idea what any of that really means
 
03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:37.110 align:start position:0%
idea what any of that really means
um

03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
so as i wrote this testimony last night
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
i had to constantly refer back to that
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
website to make sure
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
each of those were spelled correctly
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
um it was easy to transpose a letter or
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
mistyped a letter here and there
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem is that you know
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
mistaking a letter or two
 
03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
mistaking a letter or two
uh

03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
with this with this medicine
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
would mean you would come home with an
 
03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
entirely different product than you
 
03:03:02.479 --> 03:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
entirely different product than you
intended

03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
intended
 
03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
um these strains have different effects
 
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
they provide different relief for
 
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
different patients uh but under the
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
existing rules customers have to rely on
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
this awkward shorthand
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we can resolve it by passing this
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
bill when joining uh
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
near every other state
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
that allows the actual strange names to
 
03:03:27.510 --> 03:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
be used including maine um and vermont
 
03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:28.710 align:start position:0%
be used including maine um and vermont
so

03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh what are these names this is uh
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
things like northern lights pineapple
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
express uh these are the actual names of
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
the strains and in many cases they date
 
03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
the strains and in many cases they date
back

03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
50 60 years
 
03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
they're the same name uh industry-wide
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's not as if it was just sort of
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the brainchild of a store manager or
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
dispensary manager somewhere
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
and these for cannabis patients these
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
are just as recognizable as uh things
 
03:03:58.230 --> 03:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
like lipitor and claritin and privacy
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
you could pick up at the pharmacy
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
so i asked you please recommend passage
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's a streamlining of the
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
process to very simple
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
without him happy to take questions i'm
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
also happy to defer questions
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh to former representative tim
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
josephson uh who plans to testify later
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
and was an original sponsor of this bill
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh or others who may testify uh later
 
03:04:25.030 --> 03:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the opportunity
 
03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative conley the
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
chair calls on representative woods
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr conley um i'm i'm
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what full name actually
 
03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
means you made reference to
 
03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
a quote standardized commercial name but
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's required uh
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
in in medicine uh there's an agency
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
through the ama
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh which has a naming
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh criteria that's used and that
 
03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
becomes the uh like lipitor
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh and other
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of names uh that's not the
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
chemical name i wasn't sure if you meant
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
a botanical the full name being the
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
botanical name
 
03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:11.429 align:start position:0%
botanical name
um

03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
just a full name may not really
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like that would really
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
address the issue uh in the sense that
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
even though it may be quotes
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
the supposed standard there's nothing
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
that says that that same strain
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
um would it would could be used under a
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
different name
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
so it it it may be the same in colorado
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
as it is in temescal here uh new
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire but not necessarily required
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
to have the same name
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh i follow it
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh that is what happens if the um
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
a particular medication is a compound
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
with multiple um
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
agents within that uh how would that be
 
03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:57.190 align:start position:0%
agents within that uh how would that be
named

03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm as i indicated and fully
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledged i'm not an expert on this
 
03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and rather than uh do my best
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
to give you correct information i'm
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
going to defer that question to a
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:06:24.070 --> 03:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question i noticed that
 
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you said you were
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fact that currently
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
these names are prohibited
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
um and in your
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh bill as it is drafted on line three
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
you are now going to require the
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
alternate the the full name of the
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis strain
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh did you want to make that mandatory
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
and use the word chao or would the word
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
may and leave it to the discretion of
 
03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:51.590 align:start position:0%
may and leave it to the discretion of
the

03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
dispensers be a
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh
 
03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
i don't feel strongly on this point i
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
think uh may
 
03:07:05.279 --> 03:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
think uh may
um

03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
might be better than chal but um
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
as you know this is an issue that hangs
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
up this legislature from time to time so
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
but i do believe
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
may is probably preferable
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just trying to get your
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
thoughts on whether you were
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
wanting to mandate it so thank you
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking this question to me
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
the real issue is not just the name of
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
the product but the content is there any
 
03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
the product but the content is there any
reason

03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:07:40.319 --> 03:07:41.269 align:start position:0%
reason
why

03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:07:41.279 --> 03:07:42.150 align:start position:0%
why
the

03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:42.160 --> 03:07:43.429 align:start position:0%
the
re

03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
re
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
all i can think of right now even though
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
there are over 75 compounds already
 
03:07:51.269 --> 03:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
identified in various kinds of marijuana
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
the ones i'm really concerned about of
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
course are the thc and the cbd is there
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
any reason why that can't be listed
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
or mandated because that's the real
 
03:08:03.439 --> 03:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
or mandated because that's the real
issue

03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
do you really want to get high or you
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
really want to get well
 
03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
really want to get well
[Laughter]

03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you i uh
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
at the risk of uh saying what i said
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
before i'm gonna defer that uh the
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
represent the former representative uh
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
is is more versed on this than i
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
and rather than give the committee
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
incorrect information i'd rather just
 
03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
defer that question
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and seeing no hands
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh i said that before i saw a hand i'm
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to now ask representative tim
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
josephson to speak because he's been
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
deferred to on a couple of occasions by
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor representative
 
03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:48.870 align:start position:0%

03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
i do not see representative josephson in
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
the list if you are there um it looks
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
like we have a hell on a josephson
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps he is using a different name
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
shall we give that a
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%

actually a member of the house
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
so what this bill seeks to do is to
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
allow the true name the botanical name
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
of cannabis to be strange to be printed
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
on the labeling of medication
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
at the dispensaries in new hampshire if
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with strain types of
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's an agricultural product
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
and as such has different lineages
 
03:09:58.389 --> 03:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
you can think of it similarly to like
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
different varieties of apples gala galas
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
are different from northern spy
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
different from macintosh different from
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
granny smith et cetera et cetera you
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
know cannabis strains have a wide
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
variety of difference between them but
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
the effects are more pronounced than
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
just being sweeter tartar or better for
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
your pie or better for applesauce
 
03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
one website that may be of great use to
 
03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
you here would be leafly.com that's
 
03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:22.309 align:start position:0%
you here would be leafly.com that's
l-e-a-f-l-y.com

03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
l-e-a-f-l-y.com
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
it details all the different strains
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
and from their website here's a little
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
description about the differences uh at
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
a base level uh marijuana strains are
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
organized into three primary types
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
sativa indica and hybrid each type of
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
strain has unique effects on both the
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
mind and body for example sativa strains
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
are uplifting uh they pair well you know
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
with activities uh physically active uh
 
03:10:44.790 --> 03:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
for for patients that need that on the
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
opposite end of the strain spectrum
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
indica strains are relaxing and can
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
amplify a deep level of physical
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
sedation meaning indica is great for
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
those times for deep sleep for when
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
patients need that
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
lastly there are hybrid strains that
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
fall between the indica and sativas
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
hybrid strains offer a combination of
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
both energizing and relaxing effects
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're great for times when
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's too late for an energizing sativa
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
or too early for a sedating indica
 
03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
or too early for a sedating indica
strain

03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
strain
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so while uh the new hampshire rules
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
permit the differentiation between
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
indica sativa and hybrid it effectively
 
03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
stops there
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
as representative conley
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
alluded to the different letters are are
 
03:11:20.230 --> 03:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
all over the map there you can have a
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
sativa lh which is different from sativa
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
sc each doing different things perhaps
 
03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
lh is good for appetite but sc is good
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
for energy the hybrid category can be
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
more confusing since hybrids lean
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
towards sativa and some lean towards
 
03:11:34.469 --> 03:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
indica and just having initials can lead
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
to mix-up as one hybrid might be what
 
03:11:37.910 --> 03:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
you need in the afternoon because it
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
helps your chronic pain without giving
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
you too much energy late in the day but
 
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
not enough to make you sleepy
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
i first became aware of this problem
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
when my mother-in-law got her cannabis
 
03:11:48.550 --> 03:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
card she she has you know she has been a
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
cancer survivor
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
a transplant recipient and all sorts of
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
things um and so she shared with me the
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
labeling system and his confusion of
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
only allowing initials and not names and
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
so uh with her getting up there in age
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
and driving being an issue i became a
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
caregiver for her while helping her
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
navigate names and strains it was
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
definitely confusing uh with the
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
different initials and i wondered if
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is confusing for me what do you
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
think it's like for elderly and disabled
 
03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
people who need their medication
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
it is confusing for people there's no
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
other way to say it um you know these
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
folks like my mother-in-law they're from
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
a time when cannabis was fully illegal
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh and by having to use code like this
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
it gives this legitimate medical product
 
03:12:26.230 --> 03:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
an air of illegitimacy or like shadiness
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh she feels like she's still having to
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
sneak around to ask me to pick up her
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
medication when it would be much more
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate and concise for her to say i
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
need some northern lights and i need a
 
03:12:36.550 --> 03:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
point break instead of saying like hey i
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
need some stuff you know
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
why is this medication being censored we
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't do this with the medications we
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
get in pill form uh can you imagine go
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
to your you know you have a medicine
 
03:12:46.230 --> 03:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
cabinet in your house uh go to your go
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
to your medicine cabinet and imagine all
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
your pill bottles being blank and now uh
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
your lipitor is classified as lp prozac
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
is pz claritin is cl and now you have a
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
a medicine cabinet full of just initials
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
many people take lots of different types
 
03:13:03.990 --> 03:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
of medications daily and strains of
 
03:13:06.070 --> 03:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis are no different
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
i spoke with folks at the dispensaries
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
and when i asked about the naming system
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
i was told they're not allowed to put
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the actual names on containers due to a
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
rule at dhhs
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
why would they not be able to say the
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
actual name i was told it was because of
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
protecting children
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the true labeling of strain names
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be too tempting for children you
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
know there are stray names like fruity
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
pebbles or bubblegum kush but these
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
strains are named from the lineage of
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
plants that go back decades and they're
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
creating each train and as such it's
 
03:13:31.830 --> 03:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
important to be aware of especially for
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
patients who are seeking to find
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
specific strains to treat specific
 
03:13:34.880 --> 03:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
specific strains to treat specific
conditions

03:13:35.910 --> 03:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
if someone needs a strain that helps
 
03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
with appetite they should be able to
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
tell that strain comes from a line
 
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
lineage that helps that condition
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
dispensaries did not just pull these
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
names out of a hat their heirloom
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
varieties and some old names go back
 
03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
varieties and some old names go back
decades

03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
decades
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is a long established system that
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
other states have used just fine there's
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
no reason to censor ourselves among
 
03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:54.229 align:start position:0%
no reason to censor ourselves among
adults

03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
adults
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know the information is is really if
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
you look if if uh if any of you are
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with what the packaging looks
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
like at the atcs it's very plain it's
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
just in text font um you know it's plain
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
font on a medical package similar to a
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
pill bottle it's not snazzy packaging
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's not attractive labeling it's
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
not colorful fonts
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
those things if you're concerned about
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
children those things are in liquor
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
stores you know on things like you know
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
a quick look at the schnapps on the
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
state liquor store website reveals names
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
like 99 bananas buttershots burst hot
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
damn cinnamon luscious pomegranate
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
pleasure you know if we label our liquor
 
03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
that we let kids into the liquor store
 
03:14:30.070 --> 03:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh why can't we label our medical
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
packaging as a plain font you know
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
kids are not allowed inside of the atc's
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
you just cannot take children in there
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
patients are told that you have to
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
secure your medicine and they do
 
03:14:44.309 --> 03:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
um the therapeutic cannabis program has
 
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
been in effect for several years now any
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
fears that children would be swayed by a
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
plane label on a medication container
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
should be long gone
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
dispensaries have been very helpful in
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
producing they do give you a little
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
strain guide with full names that you
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
can get in person but what happens if
 
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
that patient loses that sheet what
 
03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
happens when the dispensary gets new
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
inventory uh clear labeling on packaging
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
would help in the initial consultation
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
with the dispensary patients are told
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
about the requirements to secure their
 
03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
medication keep it away from children uh
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
this is more than when you get a
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
prescription from your doctor uh
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
patients are very aware of the penalties
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
for not taking care of their medication
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i asked the committee
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh hear the requests of people for
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
clarity on their medication a
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
well-informed patient can make the best
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
decisions for their medical cares and we
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
should not put up barriers or
 
03:15:23.520 --> 03:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
should not put up barriers or
information

03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:15:26.710 --> 03:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and just a few quick uh things and to
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
refer to uh representative woods this
 
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
would not and represent gay's program
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions this is not specifically to
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
the chemical compounds that are in there
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
but rather the given botanical names as
 
03:15:40.150 --> 03:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
you alluded to there represented woods
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know so like i said northern
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
lights uh point break things like that
 
03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative josephson uh
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes recognizes
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
03:15:59.590 --> 03:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair um
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing your testimony
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
for us today mr justin it very very
 
03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:06.309 align:start position:0%
for us today mr justin it very very
informative

03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
informative
 
03:16:09.910 --> 03:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i am in support of this bill and but
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm referring back to um
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
the question of representative weber
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
being a former
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislator do you have a preference
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
between the may and the show
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think the shell is important for the
 
03:16:29.359 --> 03:16:30.790 align:start position:0%
i think the shell is important for the
packaging

03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
the shell is important to have
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
the packaging be labeled with the actual
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
strain name
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
the may is on the website so that the
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
dispensaries do have the option to put
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
it on their website or not
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
i suspect that they would all put it on
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
their website if they were allowed to um
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
again i i suspect if it was may on the
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
labeling of the package that the
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
dispensaries would go ahead and label
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
them if they uh if they were allowed to
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
choose so uh i i feel that it should be
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
on there in terms of clarity for patient
 
03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:01.910 align:start position:0%
on there in terms of clarity for patient
use

03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative nelson
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question how many other states
 
03:17:09.279 --> 03:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question how many other states
require

03:17:10.830 --> 03:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
this uh require the names on them
 
03:17:14.479 --> 03:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
this uh require the names on them
correct

03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh how about i don't know of any other
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
state that requires an abbreviation like
 
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
we do um
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i can come up that
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
i have seen is that connecticut has an
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
alternative naming format which is
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually even more confusing so i would
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
not recommend that um but every other
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
state that i looked into
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about requiring it but they
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
all allow it how about that
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
um well how many states did you
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
follow up excuse me
 
03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
sorry how many states is to have you
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
contacted or researched
 
03:17:53.190 --> 03:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh just in my research on looking you
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
know i looked at maybe 10 10 to 15
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
different states online
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
like looking looking through their
 
03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:00.870 align:start position:0%
like looking looking through their
information

03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%

uh inability to change the labeling you
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%

denied so i don't know if it's uh

denied so i don't know if it's uh
something

armed with a prescription from my
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
rheumatologist i can go to rxlist.com
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and learn about side effects and dosing
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
of things like hydroxychloroquine which
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
i do take
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
but not so with therapeutic cannabis i
 
03:20:44.229 --> 03:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
have my doctor's blessings but i'm on my
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
own to find strains and delivery methods
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
that will help me the most
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately there's a lot of information
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
available online and it's only getting
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
better as more states get on board
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
the website leafly.com catalogs
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of strains like other
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural products different
 
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
varieties of cannabis have different
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
effects heritage strains with well-known
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
effects are crossed with others to
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
create new strains
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
so if i search s strains for nerve pain
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
i might find out that blackberry kush is
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
a patient favorite but how can i use
 
03:21:17.590 --> 03:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
that information my dispensaries website
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything with that name i
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
might see bk and pk but what does that
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
tell me at the dispensary they could
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
give me a strain key which is literally
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
a decoder so i can decode the names of
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
the products on the website and in my
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
medicine cabinet but that doesn't
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
actually help me when i'm doing research
 
03:21:35.910 --> 03:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
at home
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
through trial and error i've learned
 
03:21:40.229 --> 03:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
which strains ease my worst symptoms i
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
have complex medical conditions and some
 
03:21:44.309 --> 03:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
strains don't help me
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm also learning more about the various
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
medicinal components of cannabis like
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoids and terpenes and as we
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
get more detailed information i can use
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
that to choose better medication when i
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
visit my dispensary it would be so much
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
more helpful if i could do this research
 
03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
at home online before i go to pick up my
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
curbside order
 
03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony and if anybody has
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for me i would be happy to
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
seeing done i'm looking for
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative casey conley i i do not
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
see him on my list i hope he hasn't
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
it looks like he has
 
03:22:35.830 --> 03:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
he has dropped off i was going to give
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
him the opportunity
 
03:22:41.110 --> 03:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh to give us his pleasure as to whether
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
we could exact this or should we wait
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
if he wishes to amend the phrase on line
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
four full name to botanical name lest
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chair um again for the
 
03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
record my name is michael holt i'm the
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic campus
 
03:23:31.680 --> 03:23:32.710 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic campus
program

03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:23:32.720 --> 03:23:34.550 align:start position:0%
program
um

03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have any proactive testimony on
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
this bill i just wanted to make myself
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
available for questions if uh any of the
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee members had questions of the
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
of the program it is correct uh the
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
testimony so far is correct that
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rule prohibits the use of
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
commercial strain names in a public
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
setting including on websites social
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
media sites
 
03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
and on
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh the product labeling
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
however we do allow those commercial
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
strain names to be available
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the dispensary and through direct
 
03:24:11.680 --> 03:24:13.269 align:start position:0%
in the dispensary and through direct
communication

03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
between the atc and the patients in the
 
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
form of that that key that or the legend
 
03:24:21.429 --> 03:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
that that you've heard about
 
03:24:21.439 --> 03:24:22.550 align:start position:0%
that that you've heard about
um

03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
so uh yes it's this is not in law this
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
is in rule um this bill would uh
 
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
certainly supersede our rule prohibition
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the use of commercial strain names
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
um the department does not have a
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
position um again on this bill
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
the rule was
 
03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
the rule was
written

03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:24:45.910 --> 03:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
based on testimony received from
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
that were concerned that commercial
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
strain names
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
being publicized on websites and social
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
media sites would be
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
attractive to children
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
um a couple of the names that we heard
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
today were
 
03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
today were
uh

03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:06.389 --> 03:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
of strange names are northern lights um
 
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
and point break um
 
03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
and point break um
they're

03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
they run they run the gamut um uh and so
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
we we added that to our rules um i will
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
offer that we have received significant
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
amount of pushback from patients and
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
from the atc's
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
about that requirement
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard the arguments that we've
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
numerous times
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
we do a patient survey every year
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and this regulation is a common uh
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
source of complaint from patients
 
03:25:42.720 --> 03:25:43.670 align:start position:0%
source of complaint from patients
um

03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
saying that they cannot do their own
 
03:25:45.359 --> 03:25:46.550 align:start position:0%
saying that they cannot do their own
research

03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
research
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
because they do not know uh the the the
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
strains that are available so thank you
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr holt um would
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
the bill on line four when it uses the
 
03:25:58.239 --> 03:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
the bill on line four when it uses the
term

03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:00.389 align:start position:0%
term
full

03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
full
 
03:26:00.399 --> 03:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
full
name

03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
name
 
03:26:03.429 --> 03:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
mean to you
 
03:26:05.910 --> 03:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
botanical whatever
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
would the use of the term full name be
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient to strike out that statute or
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
would a more precise
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
term be required
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the term that
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
the term that would make the law as
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
clear as possible would be the term
 
03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:24.309 align:start position:0%
clear as possible would be the term
commercial

03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:26:24.319 --> 03:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
commercial
commercial

03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
straight name
 
03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the term that we use in
 
03:26:32.070 --> 03:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
our rules and that's what's understood
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
when i think of the term botanical i
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
think of cannabis sativa
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
as the scientific name
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative woods
 
03:26:44.830 --> 03:26:44.840 align:start position:0%

representative woods your follow-up
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
no i hope somebody got that
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
your follow-up is would this be perhaps
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
emailed to our committee
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
representative

03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh my question thank you mr chairman and
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr holt um my question
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know no
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
is there any reason you can't put both
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
names could this specify
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
both names because commercial names can
 
03:28:11.279 --> 03:28:12.469 align:start position:0%
both names because commercial names can
change

03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:28:12.479 --> 03:28:13.349 align:start position:0%
change
so

03:28:13.349 --> 03:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
it certainly makes sense to put the
 
03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
commercial name but how about adding the
 
03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:19.349 align:start position:0%
commercial name but how about adding the
uh

03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
the technical
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
plant name to
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:32.469 --> 03:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
with this
 
03:28:35.190 --> 03:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
there would be no prohibition against uh
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting uh if this bill
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
we do require or allow
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
the atcs
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
we require them to categorize these
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
strains into the dominant forms of
 
03:28:51.750 --> 03:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
indica sativa and hybrid when they are
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
hybrids so that information is generally
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
available and it is not restricted by
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative nelson
 
03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes some question on line number seven
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment center may
 
03:29:15.279 --> 03:29:17.830 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment center may
list

03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
for me no it is not an issue it would
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
put the question of whether or not the
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
atc wants to use the commercial strain
 
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
name um or not uh the the language may
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
would allow them to do it my
 
03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
assumption is that all of the atc's will
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
choose to reintroduce the commercial
 
03:29:42.309 --> 03:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
strain names to their labels their
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
with no further questions from mr holt
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
roger dontenville who is a co-sponsor of
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:29:57.120 --> 03:30:06.389 align:start position:0%
the bill
representative

03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
he's having to be promoted to a panelist
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
because he's using an older form
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now we can thank you sir
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and thank you
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
i am that representative that mr
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
josephson alluded to i am a registered
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
mar uh cannabis user medical cannabis
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
user uh
 
03:30:37.269 --> 03:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
a little background
 
03:30:37.279 --> 03:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
a little background
uh

03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:42.309 --> 03:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
i have cancer i am in remission but i
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
have residual effects from my cancer
 
03:30:46.080 --> 03:30:47.110 align:start position:0%
have residual effects from my cancer
and

03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
my treatments
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
i have i have spoken with many
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
cancer survivors who have found respite
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
with the use of therapeutic cannabis and
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
therefore i went i asked my
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
medical provider if they would pre
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
if i would qualify
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
and they were more than happy to sign
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
off on me because they know what i've
 
03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
been through
 
03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:11.190 align:start position:0%
been through
uh

03:31:11.190 --> 03:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to discuss the merits of
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
medical care uh cannabis other than the
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
fact that i find great relief in it i am
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
here to uh
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
back up the fact that there is confusion
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
about the labeling of the cannabis that
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
i use uh there is a myriad of
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
ways that that cannabis
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
can be
 
03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
whether it be in edibles or ointments
 
03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
or flour
 
03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:43.910 align:start position:0%
or flour
or

03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
or
a

03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
and what i have found is that the most
 
03:31:51.520 --> 03:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
and what i have found is that the most
descriptive

03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:56.710 --> 03:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
is one edibles
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
it lets me know if it's an indica or a
 
03:32:00.239 --> 03:32:02.389 align:start position:0%
it lets me know if it's an indica or a
sativa

03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
sativa
 
03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the problems my residual health problems
 
03:32:05.120 --> 03:32:06.229 align:start position:0%
the problems my residual health problems
are

03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
 
03:32:07.600 --> 03:32:08.550 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
and

03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty sleeping at night
 
03:32:13.510 --> 03:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
where an indica would be
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh highly
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
indicated at the time
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
to to use that for for
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
early evening and going to bed
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to work my body into getting
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
back into shape after all the treatments
 
03:32:29.590 --> 03:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
i've gone through
 
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i develop hip and leg issues
 
03:32:33.680 --> 03:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
so i develop hip and leg issues
where

03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
acceptable or
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
beneficial at that time where i could go
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
out and walk or swim
 
03:32:45.840 --> 03:32:48.150 align:start position:0%
out and walk or swim
however

03:32:48.150 --> 03:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
i have found
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
the same issues that that uh helena went
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
through and other folks have gone
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
through where you really can't track the
 
03:32:58.479 --> 03:32:59.750 align:start position:0%
through where you really can't track the
strain

03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
strain
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
to see which one's going to be
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial at that certain time
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
i was a co-sponsor of the bill because i
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
and i know information online
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
kind of directs you indica sativa hybrid
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
without really getting into the
 
03:33:20.560 --> 03:33:22.870 align:start position:0%
without really getting into the
specifics

03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
and being that it's curbside now
 
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's not always conducive to going
 
03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
calling in to the to atc
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh or to
 
03:33:39.190 --> 03:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh going online to try to break down the
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
specific strains
 
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
and knowing that i could read that
 
03:33:43.760 --> 03:33:45.110 align:start position:0%
and knowing that i could read that
online

03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
online

as mr josephson has said that the word
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%

03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh not execute this bill at this time
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
because i want to give the sponsors the
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
choice of do you want us to execute as
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
or bring an amendment to change
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
line four to say commercial
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
and if they wish to do that they
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh can make sure an amendment is got and
 
03:35:29.590 --> 03:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
we can do it accordingly uh
 
03:35:35.830 --> 03:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.429 --> 03:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative please unmute
 
03:35:39.439 --> 03:35:40.469 align:start position:0%
representative please unmute
sorry

03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh because the bill is now in our
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
possession i think it might be um
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
helpful if one of us got that um
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
i personally would not vote for the bill
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
unless it says commercial because we
 
03:35:59.190 --> 03:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
have been told by mr holtz that that's
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
the proper term so i will volunteer
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
to get an amendment that says commercial
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
and get it to the committee if the
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee decides to
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh consider that but i will take it on
 
03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
myself to do that i i appreciate that
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that saves me an email to the sponsor
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative canark you may unmute and
 
03:36:20.319 --> 03:36:21.349 align:start position:0%
representative canark you may unmute and
speak

03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes just to i think what uh uh mr holt
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
said was the commercial strain name so
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
the wording would be specifying the
 
03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
commercial strain
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
name not just commercial name i think
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
commercial referred to representative
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
connor can let representative connect
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
obtain the uh appropriate thank you
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well then in that case folks should
 
03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
we do the shower of the may for the
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
first line line three
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted the shell so let's let that
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
answer had to do with on line seven
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh sorry i apologize
 
03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%

03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:00.150 align:start position:0%

03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
okay now the chair declares us to be
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%

well the uh
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%

here is is very exciting and actually
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
i think i've done to get the hang of it
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
so that if ms dyer needs to step away
 
04:01:42.479 --> 04:01:43.189 align:start position:0%
so that if ms dyer needs to step away
i

04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh if nothing
 
04:01:44.880 --> 04:01:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh if nothing
on

04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
if nothing different from what i've seen
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
so far comes up i i've got the hang of
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
it so
 
04:01:53.439 --> 04:01:55.670 align:start position:0%

04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
mute people when when they need
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't let me unmute them
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but
 
04:02:05.680 --> 04:02:06.630 align:start position:0%

04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
me about a week to figure out how to put
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
myself back to the name i prefer to use
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
well we're learning i'm finding doing
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
this from home is significantly easier i
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
was sure you would find that doing it
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
from home is significantly easier
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
because you've got a level playing field
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see everybody and the
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee size is such that you can see
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of the participants on one screen
 
04:03:40.000 --> 04:03:40.950 align:start position:0%
all of the participants on one screen
yeah

04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
and i can also see uh who
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
among the attendees wishes to speak and
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
things like that so i i may wind up if i
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
come in person
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
next time
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
to bring my laptop with me and work off
 
04:03:56.239 --> 04:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
to bring my laptop with me and work off
that

04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
it it you may the only issue you will
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
find if you do that in the committee
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
room if other people are doing the same
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing you will have
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
interference issues because i know when
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
i was trying to get representative
 
04:04:10.800 --> 04:04:12.630 align:start position:0%
i was trying to get representative
mckay

04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
mckay
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
installed on zoom
 
04:04:15.040 --> 04:04:16.469 align:start position:0%
installed on zoom
the

04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
issue was when i had my ipad close to
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
his computer
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
you can get echoes and uh feedback as
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
well it was it was very unpleasant
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah well the solution for that is use
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
your headset
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
prepare your headset if your
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative mckay or i had a headset
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
we would have but of course
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
for mark if he brings it in does
 
04:04:42.000 --> 04:04:43.030 align:start position:0%
for mark if he brings it in does
yeah

04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
and well done uh lucy regarding jim uh
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
he's on on his own you're not in the
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
same building with him he did it thank
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
you for teaching him i haven't well it
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't a matter of teaching him it was a
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
matter of realizing
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
that uh he uses a proprietary
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
when you when you email him it's at
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
mygate.com that is a proprietary
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
software and hardware
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
that is designed to be
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
for elders who don't want to get into
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the sorts of things where we push the
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
wrong button and something happens with
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
our computer and we never get out of
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
whatever happened
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
this one you can't do that and he kept
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
saying well zoom is installed so when i
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
went and looked at it
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
the screen is all purple and white and
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's very large buttons on the screen
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a lovely trackball thingy
 
04:05:36.560 --> 04:05:37.429 align:start position:0%
and there's a lovely trackball thingy
and

04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
yes up in the corner there is something
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
that says zoom so i clicked on zoom
 
04:05:45.150 --> 04:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
and it said 100
 
04:05:45.160 --> 04:05:46.710 align:start position:0%
and it said 100
125

04:05:46.710 --> 04:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
125
 
04:05:46.720 --> 04:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
125
150

04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
150
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it's the zoom that allows you to
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
make the already large print even larger
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
and to install zoom the program
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
you have to call the nice lady in the
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
central time zone because they do not
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
permit third-party installations on
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
their programs at all but they had to
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
make an exception for zoom because of
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
covid because everybody wanted to talk
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
to their grandchildren
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
so the nice lady in the central time
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
zone took an hour and a half wow
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
who actually installs boom on his
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
computer and none of us can find zoom
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
and we will never see the little zoom
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
blue thingy
 
04:06:28.720 --> 04:06:29.750 align:start position:0%
blue thingy
but

04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
if he has an email and it says join
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
click here to join he clicks and he
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
joins or he clicks and he writes in the
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
password and join so
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh you can't you can't pull up the
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
program as we would on a pc or a mac
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
but the emails take him directly to
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
where we are so
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
that all works you know it's amazing
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
what we got accomplished over lunch fran
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
went out and had a makeover if you look
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that everybody in
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
the central time zone is nice
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh this lady was incredibly kind
 
04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful uh she was
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately working on a computer that
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
was also quite slow so
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
we had a great deal of time to chat
 
04:07:31.680 --> 04:07:32.630 align:start position:0%
we had a great deal of time to chat
but

04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
um it it all worked out well in the end
 
04:07:36.080 --> 04:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
um it it all worked out well in the end
and

04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're good
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's particularly helpful when committee
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
services sends out the link again one
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
hour before the program because
 
04:07:45.680 --> 04:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
hour before the program because
otherwise

04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
for jim the
 
04:07:48.880 --> 04:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
for jim the
the

04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
emails get lost in the maw of emails
 
04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
emails get lost in the maw of emails
and

04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
i always write down who the email comes
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
from so i can use the search function
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
but right i'm not sure the search
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
function none of the functions on jim's
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
computer work the same way they do on
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
our computers right though nobody can
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
talk in things
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
without looking at best with with their
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
coffee or thinking hey we're like we're
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's funny about technology and the
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
speed of it improving
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
my wife is 14 and a half years younger
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
than me
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
and the other night we were watching tv
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
and there was a problem and i heard
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
myself say
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that frightens me because you're not
 
04:08:42.960 --> 04:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
that frightens me because you're not
much

04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
we're in the same bracket there yeah
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think mark has a tube going
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
well she looked at me and made something
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
akin to what jerry just said
 
04:08:54.000 --> 04:08:56.070 align:start position:0%
akin to what jerry just said
[Laughter]

04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
my husband and i
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
we married young and when he was in
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
graduate school i was undergrad we had
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
an ancient old tv and indeed a tube
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
would go he made a chart we would
 
04:09:10.150 --> 04:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
take all the tubes out go down to the
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
hardware store yeah them all you know
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so much fun you could actually fix
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
your speaking of tubes yeah
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
i have this cute little radio and behind
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
me here it's all tubes
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
oh is it represented i'll just remind
 
04:09:28.150 --> 04:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
everybody we're still on the live stream
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
just in case anybody we know yeah don't
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
say they're too bad
 
04:09:34.710 --> 04:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
i will still say representative
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey wiped that smirk
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
the public knows this is the best
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
committee in the house yeah jan schmidt
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
commented about it too isn't that nice
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
so many people come last year somebody
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
said look you're all there 21 of you you
 
04:10:03.680 --> 04:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
said look you're all there 21 of you you
know

04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
whoever it was said oftentimes they go
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
before committees there's five six
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
people yeah and then they hate each
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
other i knew it it'll be good when i got
 
04:10:14.080 --> 04:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
other i knew it it'll be good when i got
it

04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't show up
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
i did thank you so much you're so
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
welcome that was awesome
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is cool can anybody quickly point
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
me to the way the
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
they said the calendar
 
04:10:32.960 --> 04:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
they said the calendar
attendees

04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they can hear us they can't speak to
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
us what is the um link to it it's in the
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
counseling calendar
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
calendar and they would have to follow
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
the link in the calendar right what i've
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
done is just i cop i i copy it and then
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
i paste it into an email to send them if
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
they want it but it's sometimes copies
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
totally weird especially if it's cost a
 
04:10:57.590 --> 04:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
page break it will copy strange and it
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
will copy without the line breaks you
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
have to go back and put them back in
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
because it goes one two and three so
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
number three maybe after a passcode so
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
it looks wrong so you have to go back
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
and re reformat at least i do i'm a mac
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
user and that works for you
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
if you go
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you put in the
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
the bill number
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
on the search thing it will give you a
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
brief description in the description it
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
will have the zoom link
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
right the question is how you get that
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
to somebody else so if they can do it
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
when you cut and paste it reformats into
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
a less helpful form
 
04:11:32.479 --> 04:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
a less helpful form
right

04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
to answer a private
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%

shovel it away from the garage so we can
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
pull it up pull it out and then also uh
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
scrape off the heavy snow off the solar
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
panels so it won't slough after it gets
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
done and leaving me another big pile

i'd love to get a good look at it
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
sometime sometime i had a dear
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague at unh who was a
 
04:13:03.840 --> 04:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague at unh who was a
painter

painter
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
and he wanted a model and he asked if i
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
would model
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
and he painted it and when i he showed
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
it at an art show and i bought it i
 
04:13:17.110 --> 04:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
could not find it it wasn't professor
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
hatch was it
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
no it was um
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
oh god uh roger beatty and there's a
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
long story roger and i grew up in the
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
same neighborhood in boston
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
we were contemporaries we went to the
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
same schools we were both and i am only
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
trusting that representative weber is
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
listening closely
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
we were both graduates of tufts
 
04:13:42.159 --> 04:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
we were both graduates of tufts
university

04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
university
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and known as jumbos
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
and capable of singing the uh various
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
this is fun but we should get to work
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's 119. the public is waiting for us
 
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
and uh absolutely the final word about
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
toss williams beat you for 30 years in a
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
row until recently and tufts has been
 
04:14:09.990 --> 04:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
beating williams in football and there's
 
04:14:12.469 --> 04:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
something wrong about that
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
um you aren't going to believe this
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative but i have my freshman
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
i open the hearing on house bill 185
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
removing the work requirement of the new
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire granite advantage health care
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
program the chair recognizes the primary
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%

hello to all my colleagues
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
i am representative joe shapiro cheshire
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
16 keane
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
i come before you today to introduce
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 185 fn a bill that will
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
repeal the work slash community
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
engagement requirement for the granite
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
advantage health care plan more
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
frequently known as expanded medicaid
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
while the work requirement is yet to be
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
implemented it should be noted that it
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
remains in statute and efforts to make
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
it a reality continue to be pursued in
 
04:15:19.600 --> 04:15:21.269 align:start position:0%
it a reality continue to be pursued in
court

04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
the work requirement first came
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
to be when a compromise was reached in
 
04:15:26.239 --> 04:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
to be when a compromise was reached in
2017.

04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid would be renewed for
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
an additional five years and a program
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
to ready recipients for work and
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
discourage long-term reliance on state
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
benefits would be embedded in the law
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
requiring 25 hours of work and or
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
community engagement made it the most
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
extensive requirement in the country
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
i fully understand that this was a good
 
04:15:53.110 --> 04:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
faith bargain made by democrats and
 
04:15:55.510 --> 04:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
republicans allowing both sides to
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
fulfill their priorities
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the mean in the intervening years
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
however the landscape has changed
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
dramatically and the work requirement is
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
no longer viable
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
therefore it is time in my opinion to
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
repeal this segment of the law
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
since being into since being signed into
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
law the following have occurred
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
arkansas put a similar program with less
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
required hours into effect in 2018
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
causing some 18 000 beneficiaries to
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
lose their medicaid benefits
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
in 2019 new hampshire attempted to roll
 
04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
out its program but it had to call a
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
halt to its efforts when it was unable
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
to enroll twenty thousand of the fifty
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
thousand recipients
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the requirement
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
according to the u.s government and
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
accountability office
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
that effort and implementation failed in
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
spite of expenditures of 4.4 million
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
dollars 187
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
000 of those dollars in state funds and
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
the rest in federal monies
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
a federal court ruled that the arkansas
 
04:17:05.670 --> 04:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
program was not lawful
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
in july 2019 the u.s district court for
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the district of columbia
 
04:17:12.389 --> 04:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
ruled that the new hampshire program was
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
invalid saying that providing medical
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
care to the needy is the medi is
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid's core objective and that the
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
federal waiver to
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
fail to adequately consider the work
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
requirements effects on medicaid
 
04:17:25.760 --> 04:17:26.950 align:start position:0%
requirements effects on medicaid
coverage

04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:17:29.110 --> 04:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
in other words medicaid is designed to
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
provide health care not job readiness or
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
character building
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
in response to an appeal the dc circuit
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
court of appeals ruled once again in
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
february 2020 that the u.s
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
health and human services lacked
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
authority to approve the arkansas
 
04:17:47.040 --> 04:17:48.710 align:start position:0%
authority to approve the arkansas
program

04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
since the arkansas and new hampshire
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
programs are essentially the same new
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire joined with arkansas and the
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
trump administration to appeal to the
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
two months ago the supreme court agreed
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
to hear the case and presumably a
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
if an effort to
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
if an
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
if an effective work requirement was
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
ever practical it is clear that covet 19
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
has now created many new obstacles
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
having people lose their insurance
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic is unwise and
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
ethically unquote ethically questionable
 
04:18:29.110 --> 04:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
and requiring more people to engage in
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
work and or volunteering will serve to
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
heighten the current public health
 
04:18:33.359 --> 04:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
heighten the current public health
crisis

04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
it is time in my opinion to repeal the
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
granite advantage health care program
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
work requirement
 
04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
this was a program conceived in good
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
faith by democrats and republicans with
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
different philos philosophical points of
 
04:18:48.960 --> 04:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
different philos philosophical points of
view

04:18:49.830 --> 04:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
which has proved to be unworkable
 
04:18:51.680 --> 04:18:52.950 align:start position:0%
which has proved to be unworkable
practically

04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
practically
 
04:18:55.110 --> 04:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
legally and now from a public health
 
04:18:55.120 --> 04:18:56.469 align:start position:0%
legally and now from a public health
standpoint

04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint as well
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
at this point repealing this segment of
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 126 a a will merely align
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's statute with the federal
 
04:19:08.800 --> 04:19:11.110 align:start position:0%

period um
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
states who are accepting an enhanced
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
fmap percentage would not have the um
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
ability to drop
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
people from from coverage that's just a
 
04:21:27.359 --> 04:21:28.229 align:start position:0%
people from from coverage that's just a
um

04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
just an expansion in terms of what was
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
outlined about the concern of the public
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
that if we were in that
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
being in that period the
 
04:21:38.560 --> 04:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
being in that period the
um

04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%

you know
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
all 50 states and territories to my
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
understanding have accepted um the
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirements and
 
04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're not permitted during that period
 
04:21:49.120 --> 04:21:50.309 align:start position:0%
we're not permitted during that period
to

04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
drop people from coverage
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
hello everyone can you hear me
 
04:22:00.479 --> 04:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
hello everyone can you hear me
yes

04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't like this cell phone thing
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's harder to know whether you're
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
connected or not uh thank you mr
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question and
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you henry for appearing before us
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
my question regards the pending
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
litigation would that litigation become
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
moot and therefore we would save the new
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh the state of new hampshire
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
money or this bill to be signed into law
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
if the supreme court were to find that
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of health and human
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
services especially had
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
had the
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
the if you will the authority to
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
implement this
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
we would have to go through a process of
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
applying for another
 
04:22:42.000 --> 04:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
applying for another
um

04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:42.960 --> 04:22:44.389 align:start position:0%
um
waiver

04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
04:22:46.149 --> 04:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
because the the current one wouldn't
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
automatically go back into effect to my
 
04:22:48.159 --> 04:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
automatically go back into effect to my
understanding

04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

04:23:13.110 --> 04:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon this is don mckinney
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'm the policy director at new hampshire
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
legal assistance can you hear me we can
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
i feel like i i will be brief and i
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
thought representative shapiro's
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
overview was excellent and um i just
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to to kind of
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
share our our thinking with you on this
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
we support hb 185 to remove the work
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirement from granite advantage new
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance has
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
consistently opposed the medicaid work
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
requirement because it is contrary to
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
04:23:47.110 --> 04:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid is a healthcare program not a
 
04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
work program people need healthcare to
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
stay healthy so they can work not the
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
other way around
 
04:23:53.429 --> 04:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
in fact two-thirds of those on granite
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
advantage are in working households
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
that is why our organization fought this
 
04:23:59.910 --> 04:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
in federal court
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
and if the work requirement wasn't
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
halted in august of 2019 nearly 17 000
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents would have lost
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
health coverage
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
this is despite the significant efforts
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the part of
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
services to inform people and the
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned four million
 
04:24:17.920 --> 04:24:18.790 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned four million
dollars

04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
spent by the state to implement the
 
04:24:20.080 --> 04:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
spent by the state to implement the
program

04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
while this was prior to covid the
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic reminds us of how important
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare is not just to individuals
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
and families but to the public health of
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
likewise the resulting economic fallout
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
is a reminder of how uncertain work is
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
for those who rely on medicaid as a
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
safety net we urge the new hampshire
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to pass this bill removing
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
the work requirement to provide granite
 
04:24:47.429 --> 04:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you miss
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%

04:25:16.399 --> 04:25:26.790 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from within the
committee

i really expected to be here till five
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
o'clock this afternoon
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative weber told me that there
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
would be days like this and they're
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
usually monday through sunday so uh
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%

04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
fn
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
you've been a good audience and you can
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
now go out and play
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
what this chair
 
04:25:50.399 --> 04:25:51.269 align:start position:0%
what this chair
yeah

04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
what about executing that bill we just
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
heard there's nothing that has to be
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
well there are some that some of the
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
people in the room here are
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
telling me that they would like to wait
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit to see how the arguments go
 
04:26:08.070 --> 04:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
before the supreme court
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have to decide long before that don't
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't say march 29
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
we have to act before that though we do
 
04:26:19.520 --> 04:26:21.030 align:start position:0%
we have to act before that though we do
yeah

04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
chime in and say i think
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a very intense couple of days
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
and perhaps letting the dust settle on
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
everything at this point
 
04:26:36.159 --> 04:26:37.189 align:start position:0%
everything at this point
might

04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i just want to thank
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the chairman again because this is not
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
easy and
 
04:26:45.760 --> 04:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
easy and
um

04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
much much as i am sorry that the timing
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
didn't work out as you had expected i'm
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
glad it's not just me who has days like
 
04:26:57.429 --> 04:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
this because
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
i certainly had my share of them where
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh people were either sitting and
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
waiting for the next hearing forever or
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
i was apologizing to people for having
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
over scheduled so my turn
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you and in response to
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative kenner's question uh i
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
personally am happy that we aren't
 
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
voting at this time because i don't want
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
to address the issue as to whether i'm
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to be allowed to vote over a cell
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
phone when you can't see the whites of
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
my eyes are not so therefore i would be
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
very happy to wait until my internet
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
comes back up
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
we can see the whites of your receiver
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
i was i was schooled by by our wonderful
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
house clerk that i needed to see your
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
face on any vote
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why i keep looking at my
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
screen when i'm doing the votes because
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to find you which little box
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
by the way i want to just check
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative march did you actually
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
call in on the dial-in number or did you
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
use your phone and use the zoom app
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
i called in on the dial-in number and in
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
fact i had to
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
text christine how to do that because i
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
didn't think that this would ever happen
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
and uh to lose my landline and my
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
internet at the same time in the middle
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the hearing when i didn't build the
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
reason it up is i've done a zoom on my
 
04:28:18.000 --> 04:28:18.870 align:start position:0%
reason it up is i've done a zoom on my
phone

04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
and if actually you have your zoom app
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the phone you can actually go to the
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
meeting through zoom yes and when you go
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
to the meetings you zoom you are
 
04:28:26.960 --> 04:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
to the meetings you zoom you are
visualized

04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
only if you have the meeting link though
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
i i would have that in my emails but it
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
never occurred to me to install it on my
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
phone because i hate doing things on my
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
phone because the screen isn't big
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
enough and i can't see it and i like to
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
do things on my little tablet so
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
i i will consider that yeah it's a good
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
idea everybody to have a backup during
 
04:28:53.110 --> 04:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh conceivably because this may happen
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
again with power outages or this or that
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
and so yeah you can download the app
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's not what you want but i've done it
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.600 --> 04:29:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
you are a retired eye surgeon do
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
something about your eyes so you can see
 
04:29:13.680 --> 04:29:16.550 align:start position:0%
something about your eyes so you can see
it

04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
and yet you were willing to have me have
 
04:29:25.750 --> 04:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
my procedure on a committee table
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
you likely would have done very well
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
well yeah and we were all the
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
psychologists and counselors around
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
there to do the after action
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
thing that the trauma is
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
causing yeah thanks
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
yeah they were all fighting over who
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
would get to hold your hand
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
well that's that's representative woods
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
of course are we still in a public
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
session or is okay
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i was going to say we're
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
still we're still alive
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
well that's why they tune into this
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
channel a representative cannon that's
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
what i was going to say i'm all set now
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're live we're just we're just fun
 
04:30:05.040 --> 04:30:05.910 align:start position:0%
we're live we're just we're just fun
people

04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it could be saturday night live we
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
this is the comedy relief you know we've
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
been talking about cannabis all day
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
well you know i i would point out the
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
masterful restraint from this committee
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
that when we looked at the cannabis bill
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
in some detail nobody used the phrase
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
wait for it we're going down into the
 
04:30:29.279 --> 04:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
wait for it we're going down into the
weeds

04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
well that's right i was sent a text at
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the court of the day is me saying quote
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
minimizing the side effect of euphoria
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
end quote and i do have to agree that
 
04:30:42.790 --> 04:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
usually euphoria is not a side effect
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
but here it actually is because it's not
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
for your improvement
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
you probably know that it's my habit
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
when we have a bill that i go out and do
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
i do my own research so on the
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
telemedicine bill
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
i went to
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
every therapist that i knew who was not
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
on the committee to ask them what they
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
felt about
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
doing this over telemedicine
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
and what i learned was that if you are a
 
04:31:14.640 --> 04:31:16.790 align:start position:0%
and what i learned was that if you are a
patient

04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
territory here folks
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
no it's okay
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
and if you lay all the therapists in the
 
04:31:23.680 --> 04:31:24.550 align:start position:0%
and if you lay all the therapists in the
state

04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
end to end
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
you will still not reach a conclusion
 
04:31:34.330 --> 04:31:34.340 align:start position:0%
unless the patient wants to find
 
04:31:34.340 --> 04:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
unless the patient wants to find
[Laughter]

04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%

04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
i'll meet you halfway maybe a kansas
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
