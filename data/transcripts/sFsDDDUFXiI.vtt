during health education in public
 
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
during health education in public
schools

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
um open the executive session on HB 662
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative cord for
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
a motion uh I would move itl on House
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 662 is there a second I'll
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
second representative Freeman
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli discussion yes
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think that this um bill
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
um goes a little bit too far in terms of
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh naming specific uh videos um
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
requiring that that uh two out of the
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
three named videos be shown uh each year
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
in high
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
school um I think that's a little bit
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
much um I don't have a problem with
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
showing um uh videos um on abortion
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
itself but uh naming specific videos and
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
requiring each year each year in high
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
school I think goes too far uh plus um
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh it gets the Attorney
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
General's office uh involved in um
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring um the uh viewing and
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
possibly uh Prosecuting um if videos
 
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
aren't shown um I think I would hope
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
maybe the Attorney General's office has
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
some better things to do um with their
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
itl any discussion from the
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
second no thank you madam chair I would
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
um I would absolutely a th% agree with
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli on why this bill
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
should be ited um while I I do
 
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sentiment of it I think
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
there's just too many too many Hoops to
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
jump through and too many hurdles and um
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the bill would definitely
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
be get lost with some of the minutia so
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Celli right
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
and and I appreciate the 1,00% agree
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%

the
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you very much um I'm
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
just looking for the bill but um yeah I
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
I understand the sentiment um of the uh
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor um in this case um that uh
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh involved no trespass orders um being
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
handed out to several parents at a girls
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh soccer game um in which they were
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
wearing uh Pink uh wristbands with XX on
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
them to uh show their support for uh
 
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.870 align:start position:0%
them to uh show their support for uh

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%

00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
Sports
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
um this case um is in the courts right
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
now um I I think it would be um
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
in my opinion bad precedent to for us to
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
start um calling for the removal of um
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh Educators who we don't um agree with
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
on a certain um incident or um subject
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
area um so I I think that uh we're
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
better off uh iing this and uh leaving
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
second thank you thank you and um yeah I
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
I can't say that I understand the
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
sentiment as much as you do but um I
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that was an inappropriate
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
resolution it targeted an individual
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the courts um I'm glad that
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're taken care of it now because I
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
think we've drawn it out long enough and
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
um itl is clearly the appropriate motion
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none Madam
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
cler so the motion is itl on HCR
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%

Freeman for a motion thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would make the motion of
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:29.799 align:start position:0%

representa

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
Terry uh representative Freeman would
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion uh
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
briefly um while you know house
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
resolutions don't carry as much weight
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
as an A bill would um I do think
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
that this would send a very clear
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
message to everyone that we are really
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
looking forward um instead of backwards
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the education of our
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
children I really think this is probably
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
one of the most nonpartisan house
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
resolution will ever see we all agree
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
that going forward in the 21st century
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is one of the emphasis we need on
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
education so um with that I would ask
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee to support
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
the aop
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
pass uh thank you further discussion
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
representa Terry did you want to comment
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
I just want to add that having uh family
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
members who are involved in uh teaching
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh stem courses in uh in another state
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh the name of which I will not uh
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
mention here um for um obvious reasons
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh very very supportive of stem and uh
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm really delighted to see this
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
timely

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
timely
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Cornell I I just
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to say I think the students that
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
testified at the hearing were were
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
wonderful in in putting their um case
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
across of why it's so important to have
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
stem education and I just wish it could
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
be steam so that we could add the Arts
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
into it too but that's a Bild further
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
down the line I think but they were
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
coming from a school that emphasizes
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
stem so I could see that but it would be
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
nice to do steam to it I think it's
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
great represent Woodcock thank you want
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair briefly um uh uh
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
I do believe that this is a pivotal um
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill for us at this we we're really
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
experiencing a shortage of Career and
 
00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:36.470 align:start position:0%
experiencing a shortage of Career and
Technical

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
Technical
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
instructors and um seeing as the CTE
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
instructors don't teach any Core
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
Curriculum um but instruct on um their
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
career or technical path I I do believe
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
this would address some of the shortages
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in the CTE programs and um
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
and and really allow all our students an
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive a career path
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%

yes uh does anyone need a a copy of uh
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment to HB

440 everyone have a
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%

Hall okay y um representative Hall could
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
you uh introduce your
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes thank you Mr chair uh I'd
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
0188 um to 440 and the only change on
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is adding the word initial on line
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
six so that it's clear that it's just
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
the initial license thing that we're
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
talking about and not all of them and we
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
I think we spoke about this during the
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
hearing so it's just adding the word
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
initial on line
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%

188h

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
188h
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
just represent Terry ju uh just a
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
question when otherwise other than an
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
initial application would somebody be
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
would would somebody be doing this I'm
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why in I can
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
understand initial but I'm trying to
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
understand why initial how does
 
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.190 align:start position:0%
understand why initial how does
that

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um limit
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
those that would have to do
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
this I guess I'm asking the question
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
through the chair to the uh maker of the
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Hall just to
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
make it clear Mr chair I believe the
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
renewal process renewal thank you yes
 
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.589 align:start position:0%
renewal process renewal thank you yes
thank

00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
discussion represent McDonald I have
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
another question for the offer of the
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment along the same lines if it
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
says as determined by the State Board of
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
Education when it's up for renewal
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't the State Board of Education
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
determine that an assessment's not
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
necessary then and if they do determine
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
an assessment's necessary maybe they
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
have a reason for doing
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
correctly oh sorry I'll say that again
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
um you said that other than the initial
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
time it may be when the license is up
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
for Renewal and it says the assessments
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
determined by the State Board of
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
Education so couldn't the State Board of
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
Education decide for whatever reason
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
they don't need to take the test again
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
for Renewal and that would be something
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
determined by them is the statute
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you well I don't think they
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
have to take an assessment every time is
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
that what you think they only take the
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
assessment to get the initial
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
certification okay and then my question
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
is without this amendment without the
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
word initial couldn't that still be the
 
00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:58.950 align:start position:0%
word initial couldn't that still be the
case

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
it now go ahead it could be the case but
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
this clarifies it so that if I'm
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
renewing that I don't have to worry
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
about it was basically a clarification
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
with uh was it Mr applebe was here
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
um it was just it was just to make sure
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
they knew that it was just the first
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
time you don't have to do deal with this
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
to um um was the was there an email
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%

the discussion about the um Theus and
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%

might have came from you that's why I'm
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
asking I was
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:24.750 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
um my name is Beth McClure
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chair of the alliance for
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
public charter schools um the point I
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify is that the the um
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
overs there's quite a bit of oversight
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
from the school districts for charter
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
schools with um students with IEPs they
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
attend the District representative has
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
to attend IEP meetings progress meetings
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
um participate they lead the process in
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
the I P development and the approval the
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
charter school has no um vote in that
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
process they're they're at the table but
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
the school makes the school district
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
makes the final decision um they the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
charter school also provides service
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
logs for services that are contracted
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
with the district and um attendance logs
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of oversight much more
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
than could be accomplished with
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
anou um the the original intent that I
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
was told for the M us was to ensure that
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
there were Services delivered and um I
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
had never heard anything about oversight
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
so if that actually was the original
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
oversight any questions from the
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
committee great thank you very
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
much and I apologize to the committee
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
for not sending that around to everybody
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
um so with that um representative
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
McDonald did you have a motion yes I
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
move a to pass on House Bill
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
222 okay is there a
 
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.470 align:start position:0%
222 okay is there a
second

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you represent McDonald would
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
you like to comment yes uh thank you for
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
the clarification that's much
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
appreciated and along the same lines of
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
what was just mentioned there is already
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
oversight regardless of Theus and the
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
current um Statute in law that this bill
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
seeks to repeal has no way to be
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
enforced and there's not a penalty for
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
lack of compliance we heard during
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that right now 94 of Theseus
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not signed and 16 of them two years
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
in a row have not been signed so this
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
law has not really been being followed
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
but is also a lot of time and effort and
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
legal fees that go into it and drafting
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
multiple m a charter school of multiple
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
districts that they contract with it's
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
become needlessly burdensome and for
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
that reason I would hope that we could
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
pass this Bill thank you
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
again representative
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
Bon uh yes thank you um along I think
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
that uh representative McDonald carried
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
most of the points that I had brought
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
forward in my testimony but I would just
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
say that you know the two groups are
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
working together uh quite well in trying
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
to you know prevent and to solve any
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
issues that arise and any legislation
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that comes forward um if there needs to
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
be further oversight this isn't the way
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
to do it so and that's it thank
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further discussion
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
and so as as soon as I get confirmation
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
of that we'll uh take up a couple more
 
01:17:09.639 --> 01:17:51.270 align:start position:0%
of that we'll uh take up a couple more
bills

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
and just for anyone who's here who might
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
be interested at 1:00 we're going to
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
have a a work session on three bills
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
bullying and it's not mandatory
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:53.709 align:start position:0%
 
substitutes

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're uh
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
live um In Living
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
Color on the internet so um we'll move
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
on to uh a couple of more bills on this
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
morning uh the first will be House Bill
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
um freaking me out if it does my first
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
um freaking me out if it does my first
question

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
be so a few committees are live
 
01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
be so a few committees are live
evidently

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
evidently
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh this is unused District
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
facilities um by charter
 
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
schools and uh I call on representative
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald for a motion thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 719 FN imve itl
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh do I have a
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
second I'll second that representative
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
Freeman uh represent McDonald would you
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
like to discuss your motion uh yes I
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
would thank you um 719 it repeals the
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
right of first refusal to chartered
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools when purchasing or
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
leasing unused School District buildings
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
um since enacted in 2022 the Department
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
of Education to the best of all
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge has not received any
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
complaints from school districts
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the right of first refusal and
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
only one unchartered public school has
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
leased a building from a school district
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
since a law was enacted that's what was
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
said at testimony um so the major so I
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
think that this really is addressing a
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
non-existing problem but also has the
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
potential to impede charter schools and
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
their expansion chartered Public Schools
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
I should say um such as the reporting
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that would also be repealed
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
and it would make Charter Schools less
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
likely to know of available buildings
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
and if they don't know of an available
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
building then how can they bid or make
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
an offer
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I think at this time this bill is
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
Expediting to legislate so thank you
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Freeman further
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
discussion no but thank you Mr chair I I
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
Echo the sentiments of Representative
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you any other committee
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
719 represent Bal Bon uh thank you um I
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I think there was
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
some um interesting testimony brought
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward and certainly I I read through a
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the uh online support for the
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
bill emphasizing local controls for
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
school districts to be able to um handle
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
their own um real estate in a way that
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
best suits the community however I would
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
agree with representa McDonald because
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
we really don't know we really haven't
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
seen how it affects so let's let's wait
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
and see if it does become an issue um I
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
think that some of the original language
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill that passed could be
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
problematic but until we see what
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
happens I don't think it makes any sense
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
to do anything with it this this time
 
01:22:27.639 --> 01:22:28.910 align:start position:0%
to do anything with it this this time
thank

03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:42.030 align:start position:0%
statute um because it uh does go
into

03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:43.590 align:start position:0%
into
um

03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:47.150 --> 03:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh everything from um bullying and cyber
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
bullying to
 
03:36:52.590 --> 03:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
retaliation and uh training reporting
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
and the process of uh
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
incidents um so just as
 
03:37:10.750 --> 03:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
refresher um
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
we take a look at
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
384 um
 
03:37:22.030 --> 03:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
first um
 
03:37:27.790 --> 03:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
and the topic starts on page uh
 
03:37:32.189 --> 03:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
603 um 384
 
03:37:32.199 --> 03:37:34.229 align:start position:0%
603 um 384
first

03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
um was uh I think the first bill we
 
03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
heard on the
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
topic and it is
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
um quite prescriptive in terms of what
 
03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
um quite prescriptive in terms of what
it

03:37:48.150 --> 03:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
requires um including uh conflict
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
resolution um as part of it and uh one
 
03:38:00.269 --> 03:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
thing that uh Drew quite a bit of
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
attention during the uh hearing I
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
believe was the um requirement for
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:12.670 align:start position:0%
 
officer

03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
um we had quite a few people testing
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how anyone feels about
 
03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
um talk about um The Bullying officer
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
first because that um had quite a bit of
 
03:38:42.670 --> 03:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
attention in the hearing uh does anyone
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on appointment of a
 
03:38:46.040 --> 03:38:49.550 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on appointment of a
bulling

03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
officer if I may Mr chair yes seeing as
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
um all most middle schools and all high
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
schools at this point have an RSO
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
resource school
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
officer um and I'm not 100% sure what
 
03:39:10.429 --> 03:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities are but why would
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
we add another officer if we have an
 
03:39:15.790 --> 03:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
officer in the schools who may have some
 
03:39:18.910 --> 03:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
insight or is this is already part of
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
duplicative represent Mar thank you Mr
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
chair I think to that end also there was
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
some conversation about whether or not
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
this would add an additional layer to
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
the Juvenile Justice
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
System um so I I I hear uh
 
03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh Freeman's Point as
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
well I I I do I am curious as to whether
 
03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
or not sro's have the ability to have
 
03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
that role or potentially play that role
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to their already tasked
 
03:39:57.550 --> 03:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and I think there was
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
some discussion if I remember about
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
whether or
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
not that would be in their
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
purview so I I don't know if there was
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
anyone able to speak to that or answer
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
that question for you um just following
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
up um when you talked about um
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
Children's Services um I think maybe
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
were referring to that the last
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.429 --> 03:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
um further yes ribson of Pa thank you Mr
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh did we talk about the resource
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
officer kind of like being the good guy
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
in the school and making that person The
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
Bullying officer maybe I'm making this
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
up uh The Bullying officer giving a role
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's more
 
03:40:48.189 --> 03:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
punitive so to speak rather than this
 
03:40:48.199 --> 03:40:49.110 align:start position:0%
punitive so to speak rather than this
positive

03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
positive
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
relationship I don't know if we talked
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
about that or not but in my mind I think
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
of that resource officer was supposed to
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
be this liaison between the kids and law
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and whatnot so I don't know
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
just a thought
 
03:41:02.239 --> 03:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
just a thought
right

03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.750 --> 03:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
um yes go ahead uh if I may Mr chair
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
also I think that we had also heard from
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
the disability rights um advocacy groups
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there was adequate
 
03:41:22.590 --> 03:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
sort of resources or
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
um representation for individuals with
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities if if they were in this
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
space um if I remember correctly um
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
there was some concern about whether or
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
not that could be construed as bullying
 
03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
and when in fact it was just a part of
 
03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:41.469 align:start position:0%
and when in fact it was just a part of
their

03:41:41.469 --> 03:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
disability um yeah there there is a a
 
03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:51.349 align:start position:0%
disability um yeah there there is a a
definition

03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
um on page three three
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
601 um bullying and uh cyber bullying
 
03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:01.950 align:start position:0%
601 um bullying and uh cyber bullying
definitions

03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
03:42:04.910 --> 03:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe we had we had looked at
 
03:42:04.920 --> 03:42:06.830 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe we had we had looked at
that

03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:09.309 --> 03:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm not sure if it was last term
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
or the term before um and did not change
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
I might have been last year last term um
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
did not change any of the
 
03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:23.710 align:start position:0%
did not change any of the
definitions

03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the current
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
definitions are adequate in my opinion
 
03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
represent of Cornell I I think the
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
definition of the bullying officer was
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat Vue also um it could be the
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
resource officer but it also says school
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
boards and Boards of Trustees have
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools which I don't
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
know if they have resource officers in
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
chared public schools shall appoint
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
bullying officers for their districts or
 
03:43:02.670 --> 03:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
Char so does it is it saying that they
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
can appoint the fette teacher to be the
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
bullying officer to to do these list of
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
Duties it doesn't really say who the
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
Boolean officer is I don't think
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
no right leaves that open yes
 
03:43:20.910 --> 03:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative halls and I know when uh
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
Miss Rosenberg spoke from the disability
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
Center she also was concerned I think
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
according to my notes Here of of having
 
03:43:28.110 --> 03:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
people that aren't trained in
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based behavior that that was a
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
concern of hers um so it should to your
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
point if I may ask a question of the
 
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative who made that comment do
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
you know of any
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
evidence-based techniques because I I
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
went looking for evidence-based
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
techniques on bullying and I wasn't able
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
anything a side oh if it's for me I no I
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just looking my
 
03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just looking my
notes

03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
right um does anyone have any opinion on
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
the um Children's
 
03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:10.309 align:start position:0%

Services

03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%

investigation um and um that's in uh sub
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
makes me yeah new sub paragraph 3 on
 
03:44:26.349 --> 03:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair one of the things
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
I think we had referenced um 69d as the
 
03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
area that spoke about chins and I think
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
we heard conversation around it normally
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
being around truancy runaway
 
03:44:44.189 --> 03:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
students uh criminal code violations
 
03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:55.050 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.050 --> 03:45:20.469 align:start position:0%

03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
um sure is okay one additional
 
03:45:25.229 --> 03:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
conversation that in question that I had
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually personally had about whether
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
like student protection or student
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
rights and whether or not this a Chin's
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
petition would open up a situation where
 
03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
a student would need a guardian at liem
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
potentially and I think that you know
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we talk about guardian of Liams
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
they're there on the child's best
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
interest um so I I do have a lot of
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
questions about how that process would
 
03:45:49.630 --> 03:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
work um to ensure that if if they were
 
03:45:52.510 --> 03:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
going through a Chin's petition that
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
that a student and or parent um you know
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
parents can be a part of that process
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes there are guarding items
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
awarded by a court to help a child move
 
03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
right yeah I personally I don't think we
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
need to get um that involved with in our
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
B statutes at this point
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bon thank you um I'm just
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
referencing uh some of the policies that
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh districts already have in place and
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
the one in particular I'm looking at is
 
03:46:29.149 --> 03:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
the um jic policy yep um it has actually
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of the what is oh in this bill
 
03:46:34.349 --> 03:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a bullying uh
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
officer it appears that like in The Jig
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
policy they talk about the building
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
administrator being being in charge of
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
of tracking those complaints and making
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
sure um that they're followed through so
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
I I I think that is already covered in
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
the policies that the school districts
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
have um and U so I I what I don't know
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
is uh I think all the school districts
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
are required to have this policy and um
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
my question would
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
be is is this all this necessary um for
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
what it's trying to accomplish I think
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
that there are procedures already in
 
03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
all this do do you mean
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
um uh specifically the referencing to
 
03:47:25.750 --> 03:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
the um Chin's program and all that yeah
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.319 --> 03:47:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in statute
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
currently that um
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
requires naming of someone um um to
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
cases um it does have some um language
 
03:47:59.600 --> 03:48:01.510 align:start position:0%
cases um it does have some um language
about

03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:48:05.309 --> 03:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
design being involved which I guess um
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
would be similar to this school
 
03:48:10.479 --> 03:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
would be similar to this school
administrator

03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.950 --> 03:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
um how about the requirement in this um
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.399 --> 03:48:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:48:32.110 --> 03:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
um conflict
 
03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
resolution um aspects um which are on
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
page um I think some discussion of that
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
has come up um in with previous
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and um that was concerned
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
about uh um in some cases getting the U
 
03:49:00.680 --> 03:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
about uh um in some cases getting the U
perpetrator

03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
perpetrator
 
03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
and um alleged victim um involved um
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
together um whether that's always um a
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
good policy or
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
not um
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's also where um representative
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
Freeman talks about online 20 evidence
 
03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
methods

03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
methods
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there is anything in
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
current statute um requiring uh conflict
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know about putting it into
 
03:49:58.590 --> 03:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
luck I think each situation is is
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes different you know and where
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it might be a good idea to do
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution and have the the
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
students sit down and and discuss it and
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
work it out and other times that
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the best solution so you
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
know and and this also I think the
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
intent to this was to get parents more
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
involved in trying to solve it and and
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
again I think that's something that can
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
be situational too to try and get the
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
parents to to come in and talk about it
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
or to to work with their child about
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
doing something so and and there are
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
requirements in statute now about
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
notification of parents and time frames
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
um anyone else have any feelings about
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
required

03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay do the students like maybe at the
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year are they do they
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
go through anything
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
about like not bullying like are they
 
03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.680 --> 03:51:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
go interesting you just asked that
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
because I was just reading um on page
 
03:51:29.680 --> 03:51:31.590 align:start position:0%
because I was just reading um on page
603

03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
603
 
03:51:36.750 --> 03:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
193f 5 yes if you read that it talks
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
about the training and actually
 
03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh educational programs
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
which serve supposed to support that
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
training for anyone working with the
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
students including volunteers employees
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh pupils and parents as well
 
03:51:56.800 --> 03:51:59.030 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh pupils and parents as well
yeah

03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Marie thank you Mr chair I think
 
03:52:04.750 --> 03:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
also um most districts at the beginning
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the year provide a school code of
 
03:52:09.870 --> 03:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
conduct um and those are available
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
generally online or in person in hard
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
copy that the students do receive those
 
03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year they're
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
asked to review them parents are well
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
aware of what those code of conducts are
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
as well um so I think there are pro some
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
procedures in place
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
around the that if if that's what you
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
were asking by sure no yeah I think so
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I just I I did want
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
to mention with regard to this this and
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
maybe others is that we want I just want
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're being very
 
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
careful that um we're talking about
 
03:52:46.110 --> 03:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
things as like an alleged perpetrator
 
03:52:48.910 --> 03:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
until the investigation had gone through
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
I know that this bill specifically says
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
the word perpetrator first assigning
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe they have already committed
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the act before
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
the um actual in investigation or
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
whatever is complete so they're
 
03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
okay so just one other thing I was just
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
came to mind as I was reading through it
 
03:53:30.910 --> 03:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
um children of different ages would
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
require much different interventions
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
dependent upon it and this bill really
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't make that differentiation with
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
what you would do in a case of a an
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
elementary school student versus a high
 
03:53:43.469 --> 03:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
school student so I think that's
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
important to note that
 
03:53:49.950 --> 03:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
um school districts should have the um
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
um the option of choosing the Beth inter
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
intervention method that fits the family
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
the student and and the school and the
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the building culture
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
itself thank
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
you um so what I'm hearing is that um
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
there the committee doesn't have any
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
interest in moving anything forward um
 
03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:17.870 align:start position:0%
interest in moving anything forward um
to

03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
involve um getting involved with chins
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
or DCF or anything like that at this
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
point um and that there is uh concern
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
about um mandating conflict resolution
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
in all
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
cases if I'm summing things up um
 
03:54:41.550 --> 03:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
correctly representative
 
03:54:46.469 --> 03:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
Noble there is one piece that I do kind
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
of like about
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
this and it's um online 21 participation
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
of the perpetrator in age appropriate
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
anti-bullying class or Workshop not that
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that they need a full class
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
or Workshop but if they had to watch a a
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
a video like so that they understand
 
03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
a video like so that they understand
that

03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
impact um it might be easier for them to
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
to understand the impact when it's not
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
somebody that's like talking at them
 
03:55:19.630 --> 03:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
like when they're in trouble you know
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
what I mean so I think that this is the
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.469 --> 03:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
helpful I agree actually with uh
 
03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative Noble in terms of um but
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
I think that is included in the training
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
component that that is referenced in the
 
03:55:44.670 --> 03:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
law that would be what I would say like
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you're having workshops or I
 
03:55:49.469 --> 03:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
know like in in like in Middle School my
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
town when there were instances of
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
bullying taking place groups were put
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
together and kind of taken through steps
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
and and and given like how would you
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
feel you know so I I do know that the
 
03:56:03.149 --> 03:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
the social workers at the um at the
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
individual schools treat each inance
 
03:56:07.830 --> 03:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
very seriously and and work through the
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
student population so I would I would I
 
03:56:11.550 --> 03:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
would say that it's probably already
 
03:56:21.630 --> 03:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
I am also aware of cases however where
 
03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
the school has not been maybe as
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
diligent in addressing a bullying case
 
03:56:32.279 --> 03:56:33.710 align:start position:0%
diligent in addressing a bullying case
as

03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
um we think they should be
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and there is
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
no um real um
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
teeth in this in terms of the reporting
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
or parental involvement or anything um
 
03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
other than um F9 which is a private
 
03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
action so that you know could be
 
03:57:06.750 --> 03:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
something else that's you know required
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
via policy or something
 
03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:10.469 align:start position:0%
via policy or something
else

03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:57:17.030 --> 03:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
want sure that you just brought up has
 
03:57:28.950 --> 03:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
y has this ever been used do you know
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
no um
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
um 108 which I think uh is represented
 
03:57:51.479 --> 03:57:52.710 align:start position:0%
um 108 which I think uh is represented
McDonald's

03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
McDonald's
 
03:57:52.720 --> 03:57:54.790 align:start position:0%
McDonald's
bill

03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and I believe representative you also
 
03:58:01.870 --> 03:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
had a uh an amendment that I I think was
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
passed out yes during the lunch break I
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
passed out Amendment 0446 H to House
 
03:58:14.349 --> 03:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.389 --> 03:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and and since this is just a work
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
session we're just just working off the
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is that what we're
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
we're not obviously no right we're not
 
03:58:23.199 --> 03:58:25.110 align:start position:0%
we're not obviously no right we're not
okay

03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.590 --> 03:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
um do you want to talk about the bill
 
03:58:55.510 --> 03:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and um the amendment yes um during the
 
03:58:57.630 --> 03:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 108 which I
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
believe was about a week ago or so there
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
were some concerns raised um regarding
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as presented so the amendment
 
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
aims to address those
 
03:59:10.510 --> 03:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and it also takes into
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
consideration some points that were
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
raised by the New Hampshire school board
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
Association and so it very minor
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
changes and the amendment replaces the
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:36.840 --> 03:59:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:59:38.670 --> 03:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Hall yes uh
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative can I call him
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald could you just
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
explain like what actually changed if I
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
had to a side by side sure um on the
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
amendment if you look at line 11 and
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
onward that's the part that's changed
 
03:59:58.990 --> 03:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll just read it to you in cases of
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
bullying Andor cyber bullying across
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
multiple school districts the principles
 
04:00:05.349 --> 04:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
or designes of all districts involved
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for conducting an
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and are encouraged to
 
04:00:10.990 --> 04:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
collaborate in such cases the
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
investigation shall be initiated by the
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
principal or design of the first
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
district to learn of the incident my
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
intention with this is because within
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
the original Bill I said where the
 
04:00:23.070 --> 04:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
action originated but if we haven't had
 
04:00:24.750 --> 04:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
the investigation yet we often don't
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
know where the action originated so the
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
point of this is to say all districts
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we believe to be involved should
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
participate and then the district that's
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
the first to hear about the incident is
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
the one to initiate that investigation
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
so this encourages more collaboration
 
04:00:41.790 --> 04:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
among the the districts and then I'll
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
point out that it says principal or
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
design so if someone in that district is
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
more fit it really allows for the local
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
control to determine who is the person
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
in each district responsible for these
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
things um just represent thank you Mr
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
chair uh did we get any Clarity on um
 
04:01:10.349 --> 04:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
the circumstance in which like
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
potentially it could be an outof State
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
party that would participate
 
04:01:15.080 --> 04:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
party that would participate
in

04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
um a circumstance like in the event of
 
04:01:21.790 --> 04:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
like potentially cyber bullying or
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
something like that where it was out of
 
04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
state did we have guidance like how that
 
04:01:27.870 --> 04:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
initiation across state lines would
 
04:01:30.550 --> 04:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
occur or does that have to can that
 
04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
simply be done by a district on their
 
04:01:35.189 --> 04:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
own or does that have to involve another
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
entity to communicate across state lines
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
to ask for that
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration um yeah that was a
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
question that came up in a prior Bill
 
04:01:48.590 --> 04:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
also related to cyber bullying um you
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
know it could be uh someone in uh
 
04:01:55.830 --> 04:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
California right um right um I'm not
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure if that would be defined as um
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying or some other
 
04:02:02.760 --> 04:02:04.630 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying or some other
offense

04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
offense
 
04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
um uh could we have um a lawyer join us
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
at the table maybe for her
 
04:02:14.750 --> 04:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
opinion sure mean I I think there was
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
one sitting in the back
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
Department yeah
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
right well we yes we do have another
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
also right
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes and they will always agree it's true
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
I know I'm married to one so yes a great
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
time in my house um well good afternoon
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
good just little closer to you yeah oh
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's right you want me to be louder no
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
one's ever asked me to do that before um
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
so Diana Fenton uh an attorney with the
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
Education so I'm really appreciative
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
that this committee is taking up this
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
bullying across districts we have had
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
this case occur um it happened in
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
profile up north
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
know I don't know the short answer to
 
04:03:33.149 --> 04:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
your question I think it is an excellent
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
question and it is just a matter of time
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really thinking California I
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
was thinking more along the lines of
 
04:03:42.429 --> 04:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um but it doesn't matter
 
04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
does it because the world is wide open
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
so I think in that instance it was
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
challenging enough when you had two
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
districts having to work together who
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
was responsible for taking the lead and
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
I think that what I liked about this
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
language is that it it specified who was
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
investigation um because someone has to
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
take the lead in terms of you know
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
across state lines that is inherently
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
challenging and I would assume without
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
knowing the exact
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
facts my inclination would be that there
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have to be discussions between the
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies that's how I would
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
initially handle it if that fact pattern
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
were were brought to my attention which
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
I think again it's just a matter of time
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
until that
 
04:04:38.110 --> 04:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
occurs and my inclination again and this
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
is all speculation right before we have
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
an exact fact pattern we don't know how
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's all going to play out but my
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
inclination would be that the Department
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
of Education would work with its
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
counterpart the Massachusetts Department
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
of Ed and have the department of Ed down
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
there reach out to the district that's
 
04:04:59.229 --> 04:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
how I would approach it um initially I
 
04:05:00.990 --> 04:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
think that if you had a district reach
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
out to a Massachusetts
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
District it it it wouldn't be effective
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
not because they don't want to work
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
together but that's not your best route
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
of communication
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
all thank you Mr chair so so what I hear
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
you saying is District to District
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
communication would probably not be the
 
04:05:21.080 --> 04:05:22.750 align:start position:0%
communication would probably not be the
preferred

04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
like um first set of of communication to
 
04:05:30.670 --> 04:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
open the lines between two
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
state if there if there is suspicion
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
that there has been an offense you know
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
an offense out of state um to
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's point we want
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
to we want to get to the Genesis of what
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
happened but there's nothing compelling
 
04:05:47.870 --> 04:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the individual districts to have to
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
communicate between one another is that
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I think that's right
 
04:05:54.429 --> 04:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I and I think I think what you
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
said is exactly the issue there's
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
nothing to compel that
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
cooperation and I can only compare it
 
04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
analogize it if you will to my prior
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
work as a criminal prosecutor when we
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
had crimes or ass supect to go over
 
04:06:08.520 --> 04:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
had crimes or ass supect to go over
state

04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
lines we wouldn't defer to a local
 
04:06:15.389 --> 04:06:15.399 align:start position:0%
police department to coordinate with the
 
04:06:17.229 --> 04:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
other local police department that would
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
be ineffective it's not that they don't
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
want to work together but you would have
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
to raise it to that that higher level so
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
I think when you have two school
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
districts within the state of New
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we always defer to local
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
control and this is a great idea to say
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
who leads this how does this get
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
accomplished because you need to have
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
that direction the school districts need
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
that direction um but when you have
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
competing interests going across state
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
lines that is just a completely
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
different analysis and I think you
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
summarized it perfectly there's nothing
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
in this legislation and as compelling as
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation can be it's ineffective
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts right it's ineffective
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
in other in other states um so how does
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
that get accomplished again my go-to
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
agencies I have one more follow sure
 
04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so my additional question is
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
there a possibility after the initial
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
State agencies are contacted that there
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
would be other parties contacted between
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
the states potentially law enforcement
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
attorney generals something like that
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay and I don't think it's
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of possibility to
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
include the Attorney General's office in
 
04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
that discussion it's going across state
 
04:07:40.269 --> 04:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
lines that is a totally different
 
04:07:45.109 --> 04:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
analysis and I would be foolish to sit
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
here and say it is not a big deal um
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
case in point when the Department of
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
Education wanted
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
to create anou a memorandum of
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
understanding it's not a contract it's a
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding police
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
departments do it all the time
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
um with the state of Massachusetts to
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
have the ability to check the
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh central registry before
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education licens
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
someone someone to teach that is
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
a uh Common Sense policy if you will um
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
to check that registry because we have
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
so much back and forth traffic between
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
our two states we all know
 
04:08:30.269 --> 04:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
that we had to undertake legislation in
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
order to enter into a memorandum of
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
understanding we weren't doing a
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
contract we weren't doing anything that
 
04:08:38.109 --> 04:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
was binding on either State there was no
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility from either
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
State and yet I had to come before this
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislative body and pass a law that
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
allowed me to then draft a memorandum of
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
understanding so people ask me why did
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
that project take you five years well
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
well let me tell you why it took me five
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
years because we were going out of state
 
04:08:59.710 --> 04:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
and because we were going out of state
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
working with a fellow state agency it
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
had to go in front of the executive
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
Council I I thought you were going to
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
say it took you five years because you
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
were dealing with the New Hampshire
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislature oh no I would never say that
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh especially since my microphone is is
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
on but um but I just I I use that to
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
highlight the point that when you are
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
going out of state the analysis changes
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
significantly so looking I'm sorry
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
resident McDonald thank you Mr chair and
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
fening to address outof State um
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
investigations would this bill benefit
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
from say saying that the district should
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
contact the New Hampshire doe so that
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire doe could contact the
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
state agency in Massachusetts California
 
04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
or wherever or would another line
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
address the
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
issue I think it could be a a start um
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know and again I I really do applaud
 
04:10:02.670 --> 04:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
for thinking that globally of how do we
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
address these issues that we know are
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
coming um I think in in my work it's so
 
04:10:14.830 --> 04:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
easy that we're always kind of behind
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
the eightball instead of getting out
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
ahead of it so I really applaud you for
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
that um maybe it's simple it's as simple
 
04:10:25.229 --> 04:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
as a line of you know in in cases
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
of bullying and or cyber bullying across
 
04:10:28.640 --> 04:10:34.389 align:start position:0%
of bullying and or cyber bullying across
state

04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
lines the New Hampshire school district
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
and please don't don't start writing I'm
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
just spitballing here the New Hampshire
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
school district um will contact the
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office the Attorney
 
04:10:48.030 --> 04:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
General's office would then refer it to
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education if it's
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate but recognize that these
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
cases of bullying and cyber bullying can
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
can very quickly become criminal in some
 
04:10:59.149 --> 04:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
instances you just don't know what the
 
04:11:02.070 --> 04:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
fact pattern is going to be so I I would
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable uh with having the
 
04:11:06.750 --> 04:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office at Le looped
 
04:11:09.309 --> 04:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
into that and they can certainly and
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
would refer it to the Department of
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
Education if they felt it was
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate that's really helpful thank
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
you you're very welcome thank you
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us and and correct me
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
if I am incorrect but isn't there a
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
federal agency that deals specifically
 
04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
with cyber
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
bullying for some reason in In My Memory
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
Bank I I do remember hearing about an
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
agency that deals specifically on the
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
federal level with cyber bullying
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
because it's into some of these cases
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
are into State sure uh there very well
 
04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of it off the top of my
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
head it wouldn't surprise me because
 
04:11:52.269 --> 04:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
you're right the impact it has is really
 
04:11:52.279 --> 04:11:57.950 align:start position:0%
you're right the impact it has is really
quite

04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
breathtaking yes representative litfield
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:12:04.510 --> 04:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm understanding this
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
correctly so if we're putting it into
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
law um that we're going to go to the de
 
04:12:14.349 --> 04:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
doe if any of The Bullying happens
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
between State LA between state lines
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
would that deter some people from
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
actually going to get help like is it it
 
04:12:23.469 --> 04:12:23.479 align:start position:0%
just seems to me like it's subjective
 
04:12:25.229 --> 04:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
like wouldn't we want them to have local
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
control to decide whether or not they
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually need to get the doe or the AG
 
04:12:31.389 --> 04:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
involved I feel like I'm missing
 
04:12:31.399 --> 04:12:34.750 align:start position:0%
involved I feel like I'm missing
something

04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
here I think the issues that have been
 
04:12:39.149 --> 04:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
raised are just recognizing the
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
complexities the inherent complexities
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
that arise
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
when things go across state
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
lines and because of those inherent
 
04:12:53.070 --> 04:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
complexities deferring to local
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
control might be
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
ineffective and so when you look at the
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
law book that I didn't bring with me to
 
04:13:00.640 --> 04:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
law book that I didn't bring with me to
the

04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:05.429 --> 04:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
table um we have interstate compacts
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
with Maine and Vermont and as a quick
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
aside when I started at the department
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
of education I had a wonderful colleague
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
who who was guiding me those first few
 
04:13:20.910 --> 04:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
months and we don't have a similar in uh
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
interstate compact with
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we don't have one and it
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
was fascinating to me and and she said
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
to me jokingly she said but that's
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
because it takes an act of Congress and
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
she was right yeah it it does yeah and
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
we have a school district that is a
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont New Hampshire school and they
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
have struggled historically as to what
 
04:13:42.640 --> 04:13:43.790 align:start position:0%
have struggled historically as to what
law

04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
applies because the reality is and I'm
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
simplifying it so please forgive me but
 
04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
the reality is the minute you go into
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
another state right it's just a
 
04:13:53.760 --> 04:13:54.870 align:start position:0%
another state right it's just a
different

04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
analysis and it is because of that
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
reason that it would be ineffective to
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
just say We'll defer to local control
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
who's local control when I worked with
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Vermont school and
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
they were struggling because they never
 
04:14:12.429 --> 04:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
decided which law would be would apply
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
they suddenly at
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
odds and and their whole philosophy was
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
well we'll decide what law will apply
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
when the issue comes up and I remember
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in the Schoolboard meeting
 
04:14:25.760 --> 04:14:27.309 align:start position:0%
sitting in the Schoolboard meeting
going

04:14:27.309 --> 04:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
what they just kicked the can down the
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
road they needed to decide which law was
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to apply and stick with it and
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
inevitably deferring to local control
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the problem that that
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
inevitably you'll run into
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
which law
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
applies and that's why in in those
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
situations if within the state of New
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you defer to local
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
control that's an effective solution and
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's for this policy body to make that
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
decision but anything over state lines
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
just gets inherently more
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
complicated and local control will
 
04:15:08.830 --> 04:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
probably not you will probably see
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
immediate issues if that is how you
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you um so I just quick did
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
a Google Search and the FBI does have a
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
cyber division which deals with these
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
these things because it's interstate and
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
not intrastate yes so thank you for
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
that well I didn't have the answer so
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't thank me for it but I
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the no you actually put that
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
in my head so you know you
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
would but I think you're being I think
 
04:15:45.750 --> 04:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're being a little too gracious but I
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate but I think your point is
 
04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
well taken right it's not a it's not a
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
local state agency that's in charge of
 
04:15:54.269 --> 04:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
that it is the FBI and it is a division
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the FBI and there's a reason for that
 
04:15:58.269 --> 04:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
because you have to have that Federal
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
power in order to have that oversight of
 
04:16:01.359 --> 04:16:04.710 align:start position:0%
power in order to have that oversight of
the

04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.109 --> 04:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
states um so I'm thinking generally is
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
what we need um a few sentences is maybe
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
a paragraph on the topic of cyber
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
bullying across state lines and a
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
procedure that you know just looking at
 
04:16:29.149 --> 04:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
things um could be
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
um an added subsection under um 193
 
04:16:37.279 --> 04:16:40.750 align:start position:0%
um an added subsection under um 193
F4

04:16:40.750 --> 04:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
um and possibly also something um in F6
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
reporting represent Marie thank you Mr
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
chair um do any of these proposed
 
04:17:01.030 --> 04:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
language options regarding um either FBI
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
or Attorney General's office should we
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
get um input from those
 
04:17:06.720 --> 04:17:08.309 align:start position:0%
get um input from those
agencies

04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it would be a um
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
well if someone's going to contact it um
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'll do the uh local Ag and you can do
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
the FBI how about
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm just asking the question I
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we're not
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
getting ourselves I don't think it would
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
be a a bad idea to um
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
contact UM both and uh uh indicate what
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
considering in terms of legislation on
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
the subject I would agree 100% that the
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office should be
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
looped into that uh language that you're
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
contemplating inserting in terms of the
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
FBI the department of safety um they
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
have work have contacts the FBI there
 
04:18:00.990 --> 04:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
should be some contacts there they have
 
04:18:03.710 --> 04:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
to clear any law that is written about
 
04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
um dissemination of criminal records
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
with the FBI so that might be an Avenue
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
that that so New Hampshire Department of
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
Safety instead for the New Hampshire
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay so any further comments on Cyber
 
04:18:35.229 --> 04:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
lines um
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Marie did you want
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
depart Department of Safety and um would
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%

04:18:55.870 --> 04:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative muray I have a contact at
 
04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%

04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
you need uh assistance with the AG's
 
04:19:08.830 --> 04:19:08.840 align:start position:0%

04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
there so sometimes they still talk to me
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.229 --> 04:19:17.239 align:start position:0%

so

04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:27.550 --> 04:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
much um you know so I I think if you
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
know we can accomplish something on this
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
topic I think that would be um a good
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishment uh for the committee on
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:19:40.750 --> 04:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um does anyone have any
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald on her
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
108 represent of hall question actually
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
so at the end you know it shall be
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
initiated by the principal or design of
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
the first district to learn of the
 
04:20:00.189 --> 04:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
incident I'm just wondering if they
 
04:20:02.910 --> 04:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
might you know they might not be sure
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
what's the who's the first district you
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
know are they going to talk to each
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
other and say I got it first I heard it
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
at 2 o' you heard it at 3 I mean is that
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
you envision that happening or not
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
really I can't imagine that happening
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
but I definitely understand the concern
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's not so much the first district just
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
that somebody is doing this which is my
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
goal all along um but it definitely
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
looks like there will be an amendment to
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment so I will take that under
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
advisement I just thought I don't know
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
what happened or not thank
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
you um uh Becky since I think school
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
boards association's name was mentioned
 
04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
in connection with this uh Amendment
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
and chairman Celli for the record Becky
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the New Hampshire school
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
boards Association thank you um I do
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
know that Mr Christina uh and I have
 
04:20:59.950 --> 04:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
worked a little bit on this after the
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
original hearing to try to help clear up
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
some of this confusion I think and to
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that representative McDonald's
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
concerns were addressed um and that you
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
can try to make it as clear as possible
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
um in these situations I think that was
 
04:21:17.070 --> 04:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of offering this language so
 
04:21:18.990 --> 04:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
that somebody would take the initiative
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
to start the investigation um if there's
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
other things that I can help with I'm
 
04:21:29.229 --> 04:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
happy to try to address those um I think
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
represent um attorney Fenton probably
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
answered most of those questions in
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the legality of who can do
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
things across state lines I think it's
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
just in terms of you know the
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
day-to-day processing of bullying
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
reports and bullying inv instigations
 
04:21:45.870 --> 04:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
and trying to determine when kids are
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
being mean to each other versus whether
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
or not it is a bullying situation based
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
on the definition that is in the law of
 
04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
bullying whether or not you complete the
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
bullying investigation and determine it
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
is actually bullying I there's a lot of
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
pieces to this to this process um that
 
04:22:04.590 --> 04:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
are very prescriptive and I think that
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
um just trying to make sure somebody
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
starts that process is the intention of
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.349 --> 04:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
R muray thank you I I know that we did
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
talk about an amendment to an amendment
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
um and I did I was curious to know
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
um what what a general time frame for
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
these investigations are I know there's
 
04:22:30.590 --> 04:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
conversation about granting an
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
additional seven school days um but I I
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
can imagine if these are across state
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
lines this may take quite some time
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
after the initial investigation if it
 
04:22:44.429 --> 04:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
were um determined that there were other
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
agencies that needed to be reached I'm
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
just curious if anyone knows what a
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
general time frame for this type of
 
04:22:51.520 --> 04:22:52.990 align:start position:0%
general time frame for this type of
inquiry

04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
is uh thank you for the question um
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are timelines specified in the
 
04:23:00.309 --> 04:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
current bullying law in terms of how
 
04:23:01.950 --> 04:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
long you have for certain parts of the
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
investigation and how long you have to
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
complete those I was just trying to pull
 
04:23:06.910 --> 04:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
it up off the top of my head but
 
04:23:08.910 --> 04:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
everything is I have about 800 windows
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
open I apologize um so there are very
 
04:23:12.000 --> 04:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
open I apologize um so there are very
formal

04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
formal
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh time frames for a bullying
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
investigation in terms of when you have
 
04:23:18.070 --> 04:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
to start the bullying investigation once
 
04:23:19.389 --> 04:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
you've been alerted that there is
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
potentially a situation that is bullying
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
um who has to be notified when you have
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
to notify them how long you have to make
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
a determination Etc that's all right
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
within the law right and part of that is
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the amendment the five days and the
 
04:23:44.109 --> 04:23:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah I don't know if we want to
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
attach any number of days to a when we
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%
get state agencies involved um you know
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I would also just speak to you know
 
04:24:04.510 --> 04:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
how for the administrators that are
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
completing the bullying investigations
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
or their design whoever those people are
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
that are doing those most often it is
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
the principal or an assistant principal
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
or something other school administrator
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is by Design to ensure that you
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
have a person with that um you know
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
level of influence at the school level
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
that is making those determinations and
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
not I think somebody had made a comment
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
earlier designating the PE teacher as
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
the bullying investigator you know there
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's some reasons why you would
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
typically have an administrator doing
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
those investigations because there are
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
so many time frames and legal aspects of
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that you're completing that
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
investigation with Fidelity um it's very
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
difficult sometimes when you get a
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
report of what is considered bullying
 
04:24:47.309 --> 04:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
from a from a student not that it's
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
unfounded often times they are founded
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
investigations of bullying are founded
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that way but I don't know if any of you
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
have ever worked with seventh graders
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
but you know you can get reports of
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
somebody being bullied by a seventh
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
grade student and by the time you get
 
04:25:04.590 --> 04:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
the students together to try to
 
04:25:06.030 --> 04:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
interview them and figure out what is
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
happening I think somebody mentioned
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
this earlier you find out they're just
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
being mean to each other it doesn't
 
04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily meet the level of
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications of bullying but that's
 
04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
why that investigation process exists to
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that people are going through
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the process with Fidelity and ensuring
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
that you are making determinations about
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's actually bullying
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
as it's defined in the law versus
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
students are being mean to each other
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
which happens um for sure and needs to
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
be addressed regardless um but in a very
 
04:25:36.269 --> 04:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
different way would you address a
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
student who has been founded as a bully
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
or in bullying versus a students that
 
04:25:43.469 --> 04:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
are being mean to each other
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
resent Freeman did you thank you Mr
 
04:25:48.269 --> 04:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I think I found what um what
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray was looking for
 
04:25:53.910 --> 04:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
under 193 F4 section I which says a
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
provision that the superintendent or
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
design May within the 48 hour period
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
Grant the school principal or design a
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
waiver from the notification requirement
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
if the superintendent or design deems
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
such waiver to be in the best interest
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
of the victim of perpetrator so you're
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
concerned with if they're working with
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
other agencies or other States would it
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
be enough time I think this provision
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
right there would allow that time that's
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete the investigation
 
04:26:19.439 --> 04:26:33.070 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete the investigation
to

04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
occur and K does talk about um
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for the principal of design
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
to develop a response to remediate
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
The Bullying or cyber
 
04:26:44.960 --> 04:26:46.790 align:start position:0%
The Bullying or cyber
bullying

04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
um there there could be a line added in
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
a number of different locations
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
including the reporting in relation to
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
you know cyber bullying um especially
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
across state lines um there in in
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
reporting there is requirement for
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
bullying and cyber bullying um to be
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
reported um to the Department which uh
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
makes that available as part of a safety
 
04:27:15.720 --> 04:27:16.950 align:start position:0%
makes that available as part of a safety
report

04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
annually um and
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we might
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
expand um cyber bulling on their
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
um just to indicate something if you
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
know if it's a cyber bullying within
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
state or um across state lines um
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
because you know um it'll probably will
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:48.309 --> 04:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
um while some of you are still in the
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah I would just um be ask
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
the committee to be mindful of the fact
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
that there are differences between
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
disciplinary consequences for bullying
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
versus interventions for a student who
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
has been founded as bullying somebody
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
versus the victim's interventions what
 
04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
they may need if it's founded um and
 
04:28:08.510 --> 04:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
certainly I think I heard something
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
earlier about you know feeling as though
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps the language didn't um you know
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
spell out as strongly sort of what is
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the consequence for the person that has
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
been bullied or making sure that people
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
are aware that there is some sort of
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary consequence but the people
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
that are completing these investigations
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
even with founded investigations of
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
bullying um the part of the reason
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
people in the district are responsible
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
for doing those investigations is
 
04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
because they will have access to
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
individual student information about a
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
student's potential needs whether or not
 
04:28:42.990 --> 04:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
they are potentially covered by special
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
education whether or not there are some
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
other you know situations or extenuating
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances that could be addressed in
 
04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
different way other than just a
 
04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
disciplinary consequence um so being
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
cautious about um spelling out
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
specifically that you want certain
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
consequences for certain things there's
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons why um people may or
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
may not know what the consequence was
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
for a bully or a founded bullying
 
04:29:09.710 --> 04:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
situation um there's lots of reasons
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
where that's probably being addressed
 
04:29:13.229 --> 04:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
but perhaps not in the way people would
 
04:29:16.109 --> 04:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
expect um if they're not involved sort
 
04:29:22.109 --> 04:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
right um and just for everybody's um
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
timelines on this um as I mentioned 384
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
is an early bill I have that tentatively
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
scheduled for an exact session on March
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
3D and the other two bills
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
10th so as we're trying to um make
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
contact with uh various agencies and uh
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
come up with some language um you know
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
we'll need to uh slot in some time
 
04:30:07.870 --> 04:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe during that week of
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
and everybody has all sorts of time next
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
week to work on these things I would
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
um I would just also mention quickly um
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know and uh attorney Fenton
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
could probably answer this better than I
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
could but what the intersection would be
 
04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
for situations which would also cross
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
the line into a safe schools violation
 
04:30:34.590 --> 04:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
um that would involve typically the
 
04:30:36.670 --> 04:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
school district working alongside or at
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
least providing information to their
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
local police department um and they
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
would be involved and there are some
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
incidences bullying that I think could
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
on occasion rise to the level of also
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
falling under the safe schools violation
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
um so that would also involve other
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
agencies orus or school resource
 
04:30:57.070 --> 04:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
officers Etc so right great thank you
 
04:30:57.080 --> 04:30:58.189 align:start position:0%
officers Etc so right great thank you
very

108 okay
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
um take a look at
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%

that was
 
04:31:51.389 --> 04:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
um I think trying to go
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
down um the road of blline or cyber

Marie thank you Mr chair i h i happen to
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
agree that there is probably a
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which we would include
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of component uh potentially a
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
referral to the Human Rights Commission
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
or some sort of other circumstance with
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
regard to protected classes uh and and
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
violations targeted against them on that
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
nature I you know and I don't know know
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
if that I guess to our conversation
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
about combining different components of
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
different pieces of legislation if
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that we were interested
 
04:32:51.359 --> 04:32:52.830 align:start position:0%
that's something that we were interested
in

04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
bringing bills together um potentially
 
04:32:59.710 --> 04:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
but I do think that that is an important
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
part of our conversation or should
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
be would be human rights violations
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
correct I mean I I when there are acts
 
04:33:10.109 --> 04:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
against a protected class is that I
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
guess my question is is that where that
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
would go to the office of Human Rights
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
or is that where maybe attorney Fenton
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
again could be helpful in that way like
 
04:33:23.470 --> 04:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
sure um you there's nothing in statute
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
now that I know of in The Bullying or
 
04:33:34.590 --> 04:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
safety uh statutes in that regard um
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald uh along the
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
same lines thank you Mr chair I have a
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
question about the protected classes too
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that on line 11 and
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
subsequent mentions of protected class
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of statutory
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
reference or maybe a list of what the
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
class is defined under this chapter of
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
law are and the reference just appears
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be absent I don't know if anyone
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
include yes is that something maybe the
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
department knows anything about is could
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
that uh I saw some hand signals from the
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
back so I I think that they might have
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.600 --> 04:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
signal

04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.160 --> 04:34:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
because how how far do you go with a
 
04:34:52.039 --> 04:34:53.310 align:start position:0%
because how how far do you go with a
bullying

04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
case um before you go into
 
04:34:57.959 --> 04:35:00.429 align:start position:0%
case um before you go into
other

04:35:00.429 --> 04:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
um um acts such as hate crime
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't know the answer to
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
that question Mr chair but I in the in
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
the event of a circumstance that would
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
warrant that I think we need to be
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to be able to make sure that
 
04:35:20.109 --> 04:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
that is something that is enumerated
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
whether it is to the office of uh human
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
rights or or or some other entity I
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't know um but that would be dictated
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
by the findings I believe in the
 
04:35:50.910 --> 04:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think with the um complaint to
 
04:35:57.070 --> 04:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights
 
04:36:01.709 --> 04:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
Commission um there uh is an issue
 
04:36:04.990 --> 04:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
whether that um complaint has to come
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
from an initial from an
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
individual or um we had legislation
 
04:36:16.590 --> 04:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
um in the past um and I cannot remember
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
the outcome I'm sure someone might
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
remember the outcome about uh the
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
ability of Department of
 
04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:28.039 align:start position:0%
Education um to file a complaint with
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission um because
 
04:36:37.470 --> 04:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
of um situation with the um the victim
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
who was involved in the complaint or
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
multiple victims
 
04:36:45.670 --> 04:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
um would each parent file a separate
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
complaint or would it um so there was
 
04:36:49.869 --> 04:36:49.879 align:start position:0%
legislation about that I just can't
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
remember um what happened with it but
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
I'm sure someone can um and uh perhaps
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
Fenton so good afternoon again just for
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
the record Diana Fenton with the
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um so in
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing and I just want to make sure I
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
understand and your your question
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
reviewing House Bill
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
673 relative to school bullying and
 
04:37:19.039 --> 04:37:21.070 align:start position:0%
673 relative to school bullying and
discrimination

04:37:21.070 --> 04:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
plans I'm looking at
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
line 10 and 11 the targeted acts against
 
04:37:29.310 --> 04:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
the protected class so your your
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
question in essence is is it appropriate
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
to report it to the Department of Ed or
 
04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
Commission I think it would be to the
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission I that makes a
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes right yes I and I guess to that end
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
I guess my my I am advocating for some
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
sort of f caveat or facet of that
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
language from
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
673 and
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
potentially representative
 
04:38:07.949 --> 04:38:07.959 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or another like version to be
 
04:38:10.029 --> 04:38:10.039 align:start position:0%
this that that portion to be enumerated
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in a
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
have um do you know what happened with
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh do we now have in statute um the
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
ability for the Department of Education
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
to file a complaint with the Human
 
04:38:27.480 --> 04:38:28.510 align:start position:0%
to file a complaint with the Human
Rights

04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
Commission so my understanding on that
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
law that was passed previously um the
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was not
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
successful in oh requesting on behalf of
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
an individual or School District right
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
requesting an investigation and to be
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
clear um the way the law was written and
 
04:38:50.750 --> 04:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
the way it was interpreted by the
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and they put
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
out a memo on this was that the
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was not to do
 
04:38:59.709 --> 04:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
the investigation of those claims of of
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
discrimination um those were to be
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
investigated by the Attorney General's
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
office or the Human Rights Commission
 
04:39:08.429 --> 04:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
and that if there was a finding then the
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
department could impose discipline on in
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
Educator's license if that was
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate um but the investigation
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
itself was not done nor was it intended
 
04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
to be done by the Department of
 
04:39:20.920 --> 04:39:23.551 align:start position:0%
to be done by the Department of
Education

04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
Education
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
right follow and in this circumstance
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're not necessarily talking
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
about educator licenses here we're
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
talking about an investigation of of
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
bullying incidents between pupils is
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
that my understanding so it's a
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
different set of circumstances correct I
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
was yes so I was answering your question
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
is it related to um the language in
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
673 namely lines 10 and 11 and then
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli had asked a
 
04:39:52.510 --> 04:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
question about the Department's ability
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
on a prior Bill uh So my answer was to
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
that but you're right this is has
 
04:40:00.430 --> 04:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do to the best of my
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge with educator license it's
 
04:40:02.320 --> 04:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
knowledge with educator license it's
student

04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
so um on lines 10 and
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
11 if there were substantiated
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
incidents um the investigation conducted
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
locally um was found to be
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
um um
 
04:40:35.120 --> 04:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
um um
valid

04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
valid
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
complaint um and the victim was a member
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
of a protected
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
class um yet to be
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
defined um such
 
04:40:51.390 --> 04:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh such
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
incident um would be reported by the um
 
04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
or could be may be reported by the uh
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
local uh District uh to the Attorney
 
04:41:04.638 --> 04:41:07.390 align:start position:0%
local uh District uh to the Attorney
General's

04:41:07.390 --> 04:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know uh uh yeah I'm not
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
sure would would that be a correct
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
summation of what I'm hearing
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative Fenton do you
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
think I think that's accurate based on
 
04:41:33.750 --> 04:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
this committee's discussion um I know
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
a there is a bureau or division I'm not
 
04:41:41.070 --> 04:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
sure which um at the Attorney General's
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
office office that would handle these
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
types of cases and so it might be
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
worth a question to them to find out if
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable with the referral to
 
04:41:54.430 --> 04:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
their agency or the Human Rights
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
Commission or or both I will defer to
 
04:41:59.470 --> 04:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
them on that and also defer on the
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
language if it is a
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
um right I can definitely included that
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.320 --> 04:42:22.868 align:start position:0%
 
great

04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay um so does
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
that um take care
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
of what we want to look at
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
as um
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
possible uh amendments to a bill or
 
04:42:40.560 --> 04:42:43.110 align:start position:0%
possible uh amendments to a bill or
bills

04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:42:43.120 --> 04:42:45.070 align:start position:0%
bills
um

04:42:45.070 --> 04:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
and um we could save
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh discussion um until we hear back from
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray and
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
McDonald um you know hopefully early in
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
March um and then um have uh some
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
language drafted um at some point for
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
Action um before
 
04:43:16.350 --> 04:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
deadlines um knowing that um on March
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.878 --> 04:43:27.150 align:start position:0%
 
384

04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.270 --> 04:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
um so if any anyone wants
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
to um take anything out of 384 to
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate elsewhere that's that's a
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
possibility Also if anyone finds
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
anything in
 
04:43:49.390 --> 04:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.400 --> 04:43:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
forward

04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you my other question is
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
lines 15 to 20 are we just or 15 to 19
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
actually are we just on is that on 673 6
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
on um 673 about the form which is kind
 
04:44:10.030 --> 04:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
of I mean is that we need that or not
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.600 --> 04:44:23.948 align:start position:0%
 
thing

04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.958 --> 04:44:26.708 align:start position:0%
 
Department

04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
office office here comes the attorney
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah what of data is already there the
 
04:44:39.520 --> 04:44:44.390 align:start position:0%
yeah what of data is already there the
bill

04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
I owe everybody a
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
dollar um
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
so the department does not receive
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
information about protected
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
classes um I will refer this committee
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
to the bullying report that the
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
department collects every year we report
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
out on that every November it is on our
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
discussion was more about what is
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in lines 25 and 26 the
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate data organized by school I
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
think there was some discussion about
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
knowing more just kind of a drill down
 
04:46:02.190 --> 04:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
on on what this data represents because
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
the department is getting it at such a
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
high level um and so I know that there
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about that in
 
04:46:09.480 --> 04:46:11.150 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about that in
November

04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
November
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly go back and and
 
04:46:17.230 --> 04:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
look at that discussion in more depth um
 
04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
but I think a great place to start is
 
04:46:21.270 --> 04:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking at our website and looking at
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
the bullying report and I can provide
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
that to this committee if you were
 
04:46:29.150 --> 04:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
right represent
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
bony yes so I have the report up and it
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know in terms of what uh
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton said it doesn't say
 
04:46:41.708 --> 04:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
protected classes but it will tell you
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
um incidents based on gender sexual
 
04:46:47.910 --> 04:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
orientation race color or national
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
origin disability or physical
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics those are categories
 
04:46:55.868 --> 04:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
already there so I think it's true what
 
04:46:57.150 --> 04:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
it says is they're there but they're
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
there for the entire State and this is
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
asking for um to break it down more per
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
resim thank you Mr chair and I guess my
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
question would be it
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about making
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about what's
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
happening in our like in our districts
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
and spotting patterns early to be able
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
to respond to
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
incidences um would that be to drill
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
down to the district level uh would that
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
spot patterns or behaviors that are
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
happening towards individuals based on
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
it I'm
 
04:48:02.670 --> 04:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
just I'm just concerned about privacy
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
issues and identification of students in
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
some uh districts I'm thinking of a case
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
that I know of uh that it might have
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
involved with all due respect Mr Sher I
 
04:48:24.990 --> 04:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
know that we already have a a a I think
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's a ruler in place around
 
04:48:28.830 --> 04:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
suppressions so obviously that would
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
still be an effect
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
correct um it it could be if you put it
 
04:48:37.390 --> 04:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
into the statute yeah so I guess that's
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
my qu sorry sorry um I share uh
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli's concerns about
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
privacy because if you're looking at the
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
numbers just Statewide in those
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
particular groups they're very small um
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
so you're looking even at if I'm looking
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
at sexual orientation here um there's 10
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
there you know so you're talking about a
 
04:49:00.390 --> 04:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
lot of small numbers here and I I
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
honestly kind of think it's a district
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
or a school board you know looking at
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
their own individual districts rather
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
than having this um done St Statewide
 
04:49:12.670 --> 04:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
because you're looking at so small
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
numbers and I do share those concerns
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
privacy Roser
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
I missed that part of the conversation
 
04:49:25.830 --> 04:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
because that was a point I was going to
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
bring up is that I was also concerned
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
about data being easily identified
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the smaller districts but
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
I I think also and I I I'll ask um the
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
attorney this um any anytime there's an
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
instance of a a a crime against a
 
04:49:43.628 --> 04:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
protected class aren't the districts
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
already um uh help me with the wording I
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
know the word aren't they aren't they
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
mandated to be court reporters are they
 
04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
not mandated to report those if they
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
suspect that it is a hate crime or a
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
crime against a protected class they
 
04:50:02.590 --> 04:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
should be reporting that to the Attorney
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
General's office office of civil rights
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
or the Human Rights Commission yes and
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
um anything further in the research
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
Fenton no I wish I had something
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
brilliant to share but
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm just reviewing our annual
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um is there anything further um it's uh
 
04:50:52.030 --> 04:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
220 um we've been through the three
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
bills um and have some uh assignments uh
 
04:50:58.400 --> 04:50:59.270 align:start position:0%

05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
05:07:42.310 --> 05:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I I guess we'll um uh end the hearing
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm sure we'll
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes no go ahead thank you Mr chair so
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious when you pay who pays
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
School District
 
05:08:04.948 --> 05:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
taxes if you're not I'm just the
 
05:08:06.270 --> 05:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
difference between property tax and
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
School District
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
taxes how was that differentiated I'm
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to think so I pay my
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
property tax and my school district tax
 
05:08:18.548 --> 05:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
is in there isn't it or not yeah
 
05:08:18.558 --> 05:08:21.948 align:start position:0%
is in there isn't it or not yeah
yeah

05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay right if I don't if my kids don't
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
wait a minute so if I don't live in the
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
town do I still pay school district
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
tax I guess that's my
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
question you don't live in a town you
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
pay your property you pay property tax
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
be own property but do you pay a
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh can I see y I was just assuming that
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
if if someone owns like another home or
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
something that that's what this means so
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're paying property tax I would
 
05:09:08.990 --> 05:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
imagine it also includes a school tax
 
05:09:11.548 --> 05:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
it's part of the whole your bill right
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I wonder yeah they both
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned or right yes I see what you're
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
saying yet right I don't know if they
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
were trying to make a point
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
that pay in the school yeah so I have a
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
question um so sorry did I jump
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%

05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
you um own a business in another
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
town and you're paying property taxes on
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
the business but you're living in
 
05:09:52.990 --> 05:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:57.390 --> 05:09:57.400 align:start position:0%

Bow is ADD enough to to allow me to
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
attend the school there um we have
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about if if residency for
 
05:11:31.548 --> 05:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
School attendance purposes is broadened
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
to paying taxes or school taxes or
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes um what will else will
 
05:11:38.708 --> 05:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
this open the door to will that
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
individual or that family be allowed to
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
vote at annual meeting um will they be
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
allowed to submit petition warrant
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
articles um and going back to my first
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
question about if it's an outof State
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
resident somebody who lives in
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but also owns a a home
 
05:11:58.470 --> 05:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
here um does that person qualify for
 
05:12:01.150 --> 05:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
instate tuition to the university system
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
the UNA your P the state or or Keen or
 
05:12:06.910 --> 05:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
or whatnot um and also I think there's
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
an in an unforeseen
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
um uh uh an unforeseen aspect of this
 
05:12:16.750 --> 05:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
bill um we know currently that it says
 
05:12:20.190 --> 05:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
the child attends the school where one
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the parents
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
resides this removes The Residency
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
aspect I guess it doesn't it says or
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
where's the person so never mind on that
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
aspect so those are the questions nsba
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
nhba has um one aspect I did a quick
 
05:12:36.510 --> 05:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
Word Search the word residency appears
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire statutes I believe 63
 
05:12:44.350 --> 05:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
times um some of them are about you know
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
additional Grant programs you have to be
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
a resident of the state it doesn't talk
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
about anything about paying taxes or
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that so um you know
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's some there's
 
05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
some aspects in in current law that
 
05:12:57.628 --> 05:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
speak about being a a resident of the
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
state or a resident of a town and with
 
05:13:01.390 --> 05:13:01.400 align:start position:0%

05:47:32.350 --> 05:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
schools are open enrollment schools that
 
05:47:34.670 --> 05:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
a public school student can attend the
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
public school of their choice whether is
 
05:47:39.548 --> 05:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
in the same district or
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
not let's um walk walk you through the
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
bill if I
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
might um on page one it starts with the
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh compulsory attendance statutes and it
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates on line four the uh
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that the child is assigned
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
05:48:15.628 --> 05:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
on further down on that first page um it
 
05:48:18.270 --> 05:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
eliminates uh much of the language about
 
05:48:23.310 --> 05:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
School attendance and um uh residency
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
and residency
 
05:48:28.990 --> 05:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
disputes um which is not uh necessary um
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
in this uh
 
05:48:35.788 --> 05:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
legislation on page two there are
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
several definitions
 
05:48:40.708 --> 05:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
changes um and this is all in the open
 
05:48:43.628 --> 05:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
enrollment statutes um that are on the
 
05:48:43.638 --> 05:48:45.750 align:start position:0%
enrollment statutes um that are on the
books

05:48:45.750 --> 05:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
books
 
05:48:45.760 --> 05:48:48.468 align:start position:0%
books
now

05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
um so there is um a definition change to
 
05:48:56.830 --> 05:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
open enrollment public
 
05:49:03.310 --> 05:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
school um online's uh 1617 this just an
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
update uh of the uh uh Federal
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
legislation to every every student
 
05:49:09.878 --> 05:49:11.468 align:start position:0%
legislation to every every student
succeeds

05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
succeeds
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
act um then in section six starting on
 
05:49:17.440 --> 05:49:18.788 align:start position:0%
act um then in section six starting on
line

05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:49:23.350 --> 05:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
21 uh the bill states that each district
 
05:49:27.708 --> 05:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
shall be an open enrollment uh school
 
05:49:29.868 --> 05:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
and that there is to be a policy to
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
allow students to transfer within
 
05:49:35.548 --> 05:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
district from one District to another in
 
05:49:38.230 --> 05:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
the state or or in any state where that
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have an interstate compact that does
 
05:49:44.548 --> 05:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
not require uh non-resident pupils to
 
05:49:47.868 --> 05:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
pay application uh fees uh that's in
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:51.160 --> 05:49:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
26

05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
26
 
05:49:58.350 --> 05:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
um down further on lines 30 to
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
36 it requires each district to post
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
capacity information
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh capacity information for each School
 
05:50:13.868 --> 05:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
in the district each grade level and
 
05:50:17.310 --> 05:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
vacancies in each individual
 
05:50:20.868 --> 05:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
school on the first of the month each
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
month so that we have so parents looking
 
05:50:27.750 --> 05:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
to possibly transfer to another school
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
has information about that
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
school uh each each school district will
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
also report that uh annually to the uh
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education and the

05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
reasons that a district may deny a
 
05:51:10.680 --> 05:51:11.750 align:start position:0%

05:51:16.830 --> 05:51:16.840 align:start position:0%

05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
players um at then at the bottom of the
 
05:52:02.910 --> 05:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
page IT addresses Transportation since
 
05:52:06.628 --> 05:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
that um I knew would be a question and
 
05:52:08.830 --> 05:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%

District uh but the parent can work to
 
05:52:26.990 --> 05:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
provide transportation to a bus stop on
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.708 --> 05:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
um there is a section um Roman uh 11 um
 
05:52:44.478 --> 05:52:45.468 align:start position:0%
um there is a section um Roman uh 11 um
12

05:52:45.468 --> 05:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
12
 
05:52:48.430 --> 05:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
particularly um that is crossed out and
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
is the subject of an
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um which I'll go over in a
 
05:52:57.910 --> 05:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
0336 uh further down on lines uh 20 on
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh talks about a funding
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
and this is basically the same funding
 
05:53:12.350 --> 05:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
that is in law
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
now in that uh the resident District
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
shall provide not less than 80% of the
 
05:53:24.030 --> 05:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
district's average cost per puple to the
 
05:53:24.040 --> 05:53:25.548 align:start position:0%
district's average cost per puple to the
receiving

05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
05:53:28.390 --> 05:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
District um that's current law for open
 
05:53:31.270 --> 05:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment and I'll mention that um
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters over in the Senate has
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 99
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
which provides open enrollment to go to
 
05:53:40.080 --> 05:53:41.310 align:start position:0%
which provides open enrollment to go to
CTE

05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
CTE
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
centers so you can go to the CTE Center
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
of your choice and the same funding
 
05:53:50.310 --> 05:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism would apply for a full-time
 
05:53:54.948 --> 05:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
student going to that c CTE Center 80%
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the funds would follow the student so
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so we're Senator Waters and I are
 
05:54:05.310 --> 05:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
coming at from it from two different
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
angles I'm covering
 
05:54:09.070 --> 05:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
um Regular public schools and he's
 
05:54:14.468 --> 05:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
covering uh CTE centers which I think is
 
05:54:14.478 --> 05:54:16.430 align:start position:0%
covering uh CTE centers which I think is
important

05:54:16.430 --> 05:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:54:20.910 --> 05:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
um and on page six I'll just mention oh
 
05:54:24.990 --> 05:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
five um at the bottom I repeal two
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
sections of current
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
statute um D3 and D4 D3 is
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
relates to adoption of uh enrollment
 
05:54:43.948 --> 05:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
open enrollment status by a district
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's part of the current legislation
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
but is not needed since all schools will
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
be open enrollment
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
schools and um
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
D4 uh is related to uh uh limits on um
 
05:54:57.200 --> 05:54:59.070 align:start position:0%
D4 uh is related to uh uh limits on um
pupil

05:54:59.070 --> 05:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
05:54:59.080 --> 05:55:03.628 align:start position:0%
pupil
selection

05:55:03.628 --> 05:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so that is a summary of the bill um I
 
05:55:13.230 --> 05:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention the uh the amendment
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
that is I hope before each one of you
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
0336 H and the top part Romans 7 is
 
05:55:26.830 --> 05:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
really um the key here and that
 
05:55:30.430 --> 05:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
addresses uh children of
 
05:55:32.350 --> 05:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
military uh
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
personnel and they shall be given
 
05:55:37.948 --> 05:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
admission preference over a non-resident
 
05:55:41.708 --> 05:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
pupil um and that replaces the current
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
military section and um I think you'll
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
be hearing more testimony about this U
 
05:55:50.230 --> 05:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
from another uh
 
05:55:52.350 --> 05:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
presenter but that's the amendment and
 
05:55:54.468 --> 05:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
that encompasses the
 
05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill um I also provided you with a
 
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
letter from uh the uh Superintendent at
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh Prospect mountains School uh Mr
 
05:56:12.070 --> 05:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
broadrick and this talks about um the
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
situation that his school is currently
 
05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
in they are an enroll open enrollment
 
05:56:18.990 --> 05:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
school and they are having some
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
difficulties with districts who are
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to send or districts whose
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
students are coming to his district um
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
as open enrollment students but what I
 
05:56:32.750 --> 05:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw your attention to in
 
05:56:37.390 --> 05:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
particular in this letter is the the uh
 
05:56:39.670 --> 05:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
final couple of lines in the last
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph and they
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
state public school programs public
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
school choice programs like open
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
enrollment answer one of the critici
 
05:56:52.750 --> 05:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
criticisms I often hear of voucher and
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
other choice programs that such programs
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
take public money out of public
 
05:57:01.190 --> 05:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
education but open enrollment keeps
 
05:57:03.548 --> 05:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
public dollars in public
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
schools public school choice merely
 
05:57:09.430 --> 05:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
introduces an element of competition
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
that encourages our public schools to
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
meet more family
 
05:57:17.468 --> 05:57:17.478 align:start position:0%
needs and that's from the superintendent

verify residence.com um you can hire
 
05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
them to go out and check on people

neighborhood personally
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
um some of you might know that um just
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
under two years ago my grandson was born
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
missing one quarter of his
 
05:59:02.788 --> 05:59:02.798 align:start position:0%

05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
his life um in uh Pediatric Intensive
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
Care the hospital told my daughter you
 
05:59:14.310 --> 05:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
have to be within a half an hour of the
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
hospital at all times she lived an hour
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
away what was she going to do she's a
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher and she one of her
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
pupils parents owned or excuse me leased
 
05:59:32.590 --> 05:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
a condo 15 minutes from the
 
05:59:35.628 --> 05:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
hospital it was vacant and she let them
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
use that that for seven or eight months
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
free of
 
05:59:42.310 --> 05:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
charge that condo that she
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
leased wasn't used because they just
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
leased it to use that address to send
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
one of their children to that local
 
05:59:51.600 --> 05:59:54.350 align:start position:0%
one of their children to that local
school

05:59:54.350 --> 05:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:57.468 --> 05:59:57.478 align:start position:0%
district um I could tell you other
 
06:00:00.510 --> 06:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
personal stories also
 
06:00:06.190 --> 06:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
um but that I think um happens to
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
regularly um around the
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
country um and at least 26 states have
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
06:00:20.190 --> 06:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
criminalizes using the wrong uh address
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
for School
 
06:00:25.830 --> 06:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
attendance and let me just mention a few
 
06:00:28.390 --> 06:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
polls on this
 
06:00:31.830 --> 06:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
topic um October
 
06:00:35.230 --> 06:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
2023 from a group called yes every kid
 
06:00:36.430 --> 06:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
and you
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
government showed that 84% of school
 
06:00:43.310 --> 06:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
parents supported K12 open
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment in July
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
2024 Ed Choice polling shows that 73% of
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
school parents supported open
 
06:00:57.670 --> 06:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment 69% of Republicans 81% of
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
Democrats and
 
06:01:08.628 --> 06:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
I think that public
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
schools should be open to all students
 
06:01:19.390 --> 06:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
like public parks like public
 
06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
libraries competition as the
 
06:01:23.948 --> 06:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
superintendent in Prospect Mountain
 
06:01:27.750 --> 06:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out will work to benefit all
 
06:01:30.468 --> 06:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
public schools and all
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
students and provide for greater
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
achievement and success for those
 
06:01:41.788 --> 06:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
students I believe that open enrollment
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
and public school choice is one answer
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
to the problems that we see with
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
academics in the State uh satisfaction
 
06:01:56.830 --> 06:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
of students student behavioral issues
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
and many other things um if students can
 
06:02:03.628 --> 06:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
attend the school that meets their needs
 
06:02:06.030 --> 06:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
and in which they're happy I think the
 
06:02:08.430 --> 06:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
entire system and the state will be
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
better off thank you thank you
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%

06:03:04.548 --> 06:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
H thank you again for taking my question
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
can you like just just take a school
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
district and and like picture what this
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
all looks like I I'm I'm you know they
 
06:03:15.708 --> 06:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
got a few spaces available or you just
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
you know process many many if not most
 
06:03:22.270 --> 06:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
schools um public schools in the state
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
are facing declining
 
06:03:27.430 --> 06:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment and have capacity and I
 
06:03:30.270 --> 06:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
believe there are schools that are
 
06:03:33.788 --> 06:03:33.798 align:start position:0%
looking to to outside their
 
06:03:38.430 --> 06:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries um to to uh attract students
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
um and this provides them the legal
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do so um I liveed in
 
06:03:48.990 --> 06:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro and our kids um used to go to
 
06:03:51.788 --> 06:03:51.798 align:start position:0%
Molten Boro uh for
 
06:03:56.230 --> 06:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
school um they now go to wolfboro but
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
there are certainly some areas of tuen
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
Boro that are closer to Molten
 
06:04:05.708 --> 06:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
Boro um once you get Beyond um element
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
El School uh closer to Molten Boro than
 
06:04:11.468 --> 06:04:11.478 align:start position:0%
they are to uh to
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
wolfboro um if um this law uh were if
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become law would some
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
of those children choose to go to Molten
 
06:04:22.400 --> 06:04:23.468 align:start position:0%
of those children choose to go to Molten
Boro

06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%

06:05:15.390 --> 06:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
question um with regard to page three of
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill um lines 27 through
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
37 um we're talking about Transportation
 
06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
here it is there any
 
06:05:31.868 --> 06:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
um mileage limit like distance between
 
06:05:33.910 --> 06:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
which you know could could potentially
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
somebody in Coos County enroll their
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
based on this bill uh enroll their
 
06:05:46.628 --> 06:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
student in a another District
 
06:05:49.390 --> 06:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh on the southern part of the state I
 
06:05:52.190 --> 06:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
mean I guess my question is um it I know
 
06:05:53.590 --> 06:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a conversation about
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
additional costs but to what end are we
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
talking about distance traveled and how
 
06:06:01.390 --> 06:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
long a student is potentially
 
06:06:05.670 --> 06:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
on a bus a vehicle neither sending nor
 
06:06:07.350 --> 06:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
the receiving School District shall be
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
obligated to provide transportation
 
06:06:14.670 --> 06:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
services um it so uh I certainly can see
 
06:06:19.150 --> 06:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
um a a parent um let's say in Caroll
 
06:06:23.548 --> 06:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
County where I am um working in bellnap
 
06:06:28.350 --> 06:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
or Grafton County and um uh taking their
 
06:06:32.948 --> 06:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
child um to a school over closer to
 
06:06:35.070 --> 06:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
where they work and driving them to
 
06:06:35.080 --> 06:06:38.070 align:start position:0%
where they work and driving them to
school

06:06:38.070 --> 06:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
we we actually had
 
06:06:43.510 --> 06:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um uh last
 
06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
term um it was ultimately defeated uh
 
06:06:51.150 --> 06:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
but would have allowed um uh someone
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
working at a school outside of their
 
06:06:56.910 --> 06:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
resident District to um enroll their
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
child in that school where they
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
worked followup Madam chair uh so my I I
 
06:07:06.110 --> 06:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
guess and then my other question is
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
should a a a student or a pupil receive
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh specialized services that require
 
06:07:13.990 --> 06:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation um um what special ed
 
06:07:17.350 --> 06:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
services um would be um the requirement
 
06:07:19.990 --> 06:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the resident District um just like
 
06:07:20.000 --> 06:07:21.030 align:start position:0%
of the resident District um just like
with

06:07:21.030 --> 06:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
um uh charter schools and that's on uh
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 um which I neglected to point
 
06:07:32.270 --> 06:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:41.350 --> 06:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow one final followup if I may Madam
 
06:07:45.990 --> 06:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair yes okay thank you is there a
 
06:07:47.628 --> 06:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
world in which a student with special
 
06:07:49.948 --> 06:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
needs could be on a a bus or a
 
06:07:53.070 --> 06:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
transportation for for an hour two hours
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
like I mean depending I I uh I would not
 
06:07:58.240 --> 06:08:03.310 align:start position:0%
like I mean depending I I uh I would not
foresee

06:08:03.310 --> 06:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
that of B Bon thank you madam chair and
 
06:08:09.390 --> 06:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on page
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
two lines
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh 29 through 35 um it's talking
 
06:08:19.030 --> 06:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
about each School District shall
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
determine for each School in the
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
district the capacity of each School in
 
06:08:25.750 --> 06:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
each grade level and it says the school
 
06:08:28.590 --> 06:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
districts will post the total capacity
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
who who DET who has the responsibility
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
of determining that capacity because
 
06:08:36.390 --> 06:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
capacity can change depending upon the
 
06:08:40.030 --> 06:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
individual needs of a classroom um so
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
how if
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
you just from my Schoolboard experience
 
06:08:46.110 --> 06:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at different
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
classroom compositions you might need a
 
06:08:51.990 --> 06:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
smaller capacity in that class I mean
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
capacity could refer to how many kids
 
06:08:58.868 --> 06:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
you can put in the room um right so yes
 
06:09:01.150 --> 06:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
um well that's why
 
06:09:04.910 --> 06:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
um it would be posted each month um but
 
06:09:09.030 --> 06:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
also talks about each um each grade
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
level so is it your thought that the
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
school will determine how many yes so
 
06:09:16.788 --> 06:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
it's completely up to the school to
 
06:09:19.708 --> 06:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
decide yes is it U it would be similar
 
06:09:22.510 --> 06:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
to um the way it's done um we had a bill
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
about um unused space um and Charter
 
06:09:31.350 --> 06:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
Schools um and again that would the
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
unused space would is determined by the
 
06:09:37.230 --> 06:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
school followup please follow um so then
 
06:09:40.190 --> 06:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of that it says that um
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're by the first of the month so if I
 
06:09:45.670 --> 06:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
read this correctly you're you people
 
06:09:48.468 --> 06:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
would be able to transfer into uh
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
established classrooms throughout the
 
06:09:55.670 --> 06:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:58.350 --> 06:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
correct representative Murray thank you
 
06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair what happens if a student uh
 
06:10:04.350 --> 06:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know transfers in to a district
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
and they don't happen to be at the same
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
place in their learning Academic Year as
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
their previous School uh is there some
 
06:10:13.390 --> 06:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
onus on the district then to provide
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
services to either catch that student up
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
or if they're completely at a different
 
06:10:19.468 --> 06:10:19.478 align:start position:0%
place as determined by each district
 
06:10:20.990 --> 06:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
because the districts and the school
 
06:10:23.468 --> 06:10:23.478 align:start position:0%
boards um approve their curriculums for
 
06:10:25.030 --> 06:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
the year and they they look different
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
across districts how do you ensure that
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have a student every month
 
06:10:30.990 --> 06:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
walking into a different academic
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
setting where they may be way ahead or
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
way behind I I think it would be um the
 
06:10:39.468 --> 06:10:39.478 align:start position:0%
same as if a student moved into a new
 
06:10:42.510 --> 06:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
school district and enrolled in that new
 
06:10:45.350 --> 06:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
school district during the school year
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
um they would evaluate um where they
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
were and accommodate that student um I
 
06:10:55.230 --> 06:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't see it um any different for an
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
open enrollment student than someone
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.270 --> 06:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
district Madam chair but uh you did say
 
06:11:05.788 --> 06:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
that the census numbers could change
 
06:11:07.750 --> 06:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
potentially monthly correct so if a
 
06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
student enrolled one month at school a
 
06:11:12.910 --> 06:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
is there a possibility that they could
 
06:11:17.110 --> 06:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
in two months three months time enroll
 
06:11:21.390 --> 06:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um I I would think that um if
 
06:11:26.190 --> 06:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
they enrolled um uh if for instance um
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
child from uh Tuftonboro enrolled uh in
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
the Middle School in um molten Boro um
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
and after a couple of months found
 
06:11:39.230 --> 06:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
um that um it was not the right fit for
 
06:11:44.350 --> 06:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
them um or um there were some uh other
 
06:11:47.270 --> 06:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
problems there at the school um then um
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
they would be free to transfer back to
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh tuffen Boro and go to the wolfboro
 
06:11:52.878 --> 06:11:54.510 align:start position:0%
uh uh tuffen Boro and go to the wolfboro

School representative
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair I actually
 
06:12:02.350 --> 06:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
have two questions if you'll indulge me
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli for
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so from what I've
 
06:12:08.548 --> 06:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
gathered from the the the Crux of this
 
06:12:10.670 --> 06:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill this doesn't take away any local
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
control of the districts is that correct
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so thank you and my
 
06:12:17.628 --> 06:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
second question is and to address some
 
06:12:20.190 --> 06:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
of the the concerns about people coming
 
06:12:22.230 --> 06:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
and going and coming and going right now
 
06:12:25.788 --> 06:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
in um in the larger cities in New
 
06:12:27.750 --> 06:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Manchester and nationa don't
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
they deal with very
 
06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
transient um
 
06:12:35.548 --> 06:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
populations um that is my understanding
 
06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
that they do um from talking to people
 
06:12:40.190 --> 06:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
from uh from
 
06:12:42.468 --> 06:12:42.478 align:start position:0%
Manchester thank
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Hall you madam chair
 
06:12:47.390 --> 06:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
06:12:49.868 --> 06:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
does the school district decide who they
 
06:12:52.270 --> 06:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
take let's say 10 special needs students
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
want to come to Bo because they've heard
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
the program is good and maybe there are
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
there I mean and they only have room for
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
two how is that decided upon um uh first
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
they would take the the first two
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
applying the first come first serve no
 
06:13:08.070 --> 06:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
matter who the kids are oh sorry
 
06:13:11.468 --> 06:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
followup sure okay so it's a first come
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
first serve when the seats open they get
 
06:13:16.190 --> 06:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
it right and cut and the followup to
 
06:13:16.200 --> 06:13:17.548 align:start position:0%
it right and cut and the followup to
that

06:13:17.548 --> 06:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
um how does this affect SAU budgets
 
06:13:23.350 --> 06:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
School District budgets I mean can they
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
budget for all these people coming
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
in uh they don't even know what they're
 
06:13:31.150 --> 06:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
going to cost right right oh they have
 
06:13:33.310 --> 06:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh children moving in during the school
 
06:13:36.990 --> 06:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
year um
 
06:13:40.910 --> 06:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't you know I'm not
 
06:13:44.190 --> 06:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
envisioning um you know busloads of
 
06:13:48.350 --> 06:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
students um moving from um you know tuen
 
06:13:53.548 --> 06:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
Boro to Molten Boro um
 
06:13:53.558 --> 06:13:55.190 align:start position:0%
Boro to Molten Boro um
uh

06:13:55.190 --> 06:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:00.030 --> 06:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have statistics with me on
 
06:14:02.030 --> 06:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
um states that have open enrollment
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
about how how many students are involved
 
06:14:10.390 --> 06:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
um but I know that um from what I read
 
06:14:12.070 --> 06:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
um in in
 
06:14:16.030 --> 06:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin um where they have uh a open
 
06:14:16.040 --> 06:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin um where they have uh a open
enrollment

06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
06:14:21.310 --> 06:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
um I think it was 31% of the students
 
06:14:25.830 --> 06:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:29.468 --> 06:14:29.478 align:start position:0%
areas thank you any other
 
06:14:32.468 --> 06:14:32.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative B Bon thank you
 
06:14:34.708 --> 06:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you for taking my
 
06:14:36.830 --> 06:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
question uh would it be possible for you
 
06:14:40.070 --> 06:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
to uh share with us your research um and
 
06:14:42.990 --> 06:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the states that have these policies in
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
place so that uh we would have some type
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
of comparison yes M sure thank
 
06:14:52.510 --> 06:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:15:01.270 --> 06:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:13.110 --> 06:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um thank you for taking
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
my testimony I'm Mary Wilkey I live in
 
06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
conquer I'm a retired public school
 
06:15:21.948 --> 06:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
teacher and I oppose this bill um two
 
06:15:25.350 --> 06:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
main reasons the first is uh at a time
 
06:15:28.190 --> 06:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
when we have such big gaps between um
 
06:15:31.310 --> 06:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
rich and poor in our culture our society
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
um I feel that open these open
 
06:15:34.468 --> 06:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
enrollment bills this one and some of
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
the other ones that have been uh
 
06:15:39.430 --> 06:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
proposed tend to favor The Haves and
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
disadvantage the Have Nots um people I I
 
06:15:46.948 --> 06:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
heard um Senator Lang um introduced a
 
06:15:49.788 --> 06:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
similar bill in the Senate and said that
 
06:15:51.548 --> 06:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
these bills are prioritizing what's best
 
06:15:54.310 --> 06:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
for each individual student and I feel
 
06:15:56.270 --> 06:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
like that's the sentiment behind many of
 
06:15:58.270 --> 06:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
bills like this as well as some other
 
06:16:00.910 --> 06:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
privatization kinds of bills um but I
 
06:16:02.270 --> 06:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't think they really do I think
 
06:16:05.548 --> 06:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
they're Pro this bill prioritizes
 
06:16:08.548 --> 06:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
students who qualify for transfers so
 
06:16:10.110 --> 06:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
students who don't have discipline
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
issues who haven't been absent a lot who
 
06:16:15.390 --> 06:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
um haven't ever been expelled um
 
06:16:17.310 --> 06:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
students whose parents can provide the
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
transportation to another District which
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
tend to be parents who have more means
 
06:16:25.230 --> 06:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
um and then there's the other group who
 
06:16:27.510 --> 06:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
we should also prioritize and we aren't
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
talking about them we're talking about
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
giving a certain group of people a
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
privilege but ignoring the rest
 
06:16:38.948 --> 06:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
and um so if we have uh for instance two
 
06:16:41.990 --> 06:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
students in a district and uh one
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
transfers to a new District because she
 
06:16:45.990 --> 06:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
wants to take French and her District
 
06:16:47.788 --> 06:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
provides no foreign language because
 
06:16:50.510 --> 06:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
they don't they're a property poor town
 
06:16:53.070 --> 06:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
and um her best friend wants to take
 
06:16:55.230 --> 06:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
French too but her parents can't afford
 
06:16:57.948 --> 06:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
to get her to provide transportation or
 
06:16:59.230 --> 06:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have the time to provide
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
transportation to the other District or
 
06:17:04.110 --> 06:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
she maybe her parents have uh substance
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
abuse issues that's caused her to be
 
06:17:08.070 --> 06:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
absent a lot so she doesn't get that
 
06:17:09.750 --> 06:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity what are we doing to
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
prioritize her I feel like we have to
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
prioritize every single child in New
 
06:17:16.468 --> 06:17:16.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools and the only reason we
 
06:17:18.590 --> 06:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
can prioritize both of those children
 
06:17:20.548 --> 06:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
and make sure they both get foreign
 
06:17:23.310 --> 06:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
language which is a it's not something
 
06:17:27.190 --> 06:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
like you know having um major theater in
 
06:17:30.270 --> 06:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
their school some huge theatrical uh
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's it's a basic that we
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
all expect in our high schools if we the
 
06:17:37.150 --> 06:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
only way we can prioritize that for both
 
06:17:38.670 --> 06:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
of them is to make sure that the
 
06:17:40.868 --> 06:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
original School District can offer
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
foreign language and the way we can do
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
that is to make sure that every district
 
06:17:47.110 --> 06:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
has the amount of funding they need to
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
provide the basics that are in our Core
 
06:17:53.070 --> 06:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
Curriculum in our adequacy uh laws um
 
06:17:56.468 --> 06:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
and then the um and and because also as
 
06:17:58.948 --> 06:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
students who have the means and who fit
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
the qualifications leave their District
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
the students who left behind are the
 
06:18:06.390 --> 06:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
ones whose parents don't have the means
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
to help them do it or who have
 
06:18:09.868 --> 06:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues whatever the issues
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
are they are they tend to be more than
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
average in terms of the expense of
 
06:18:17.150 --> 06:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
educating them and yet more resources
 
06:18:18.990 --> 06:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
are leaving and so they're going to be
 
06:18:21.150 --> 06:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
left with fewer resources than they had
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
when students started leaving their
 
06:18:26.350 --> 06:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
district and the second issue is and I'm
 
06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if when I read on page four
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
line 23 saying how much how the money
 
06:18:38.110 --> 06:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
goes between the two districts I read it
 
06:18:39.788 --> 06:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
differently than you intended
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I thought it it
 
06:18:44.990 --> 06:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
says the pupils resident District shall
 
06:18:47.708 --> 06:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
pay to the receiving District the am an
 
06:18:49.788 --> 06:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
amount equal to not less than 80% of
 
06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
that District's average cost I thought
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
it meant the receiving districts I think
 
06:18:55.390 --> 06:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
it would be good to clarify if you I
 
06:18:58.230 --> 06:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
think you what you said was you meant it
 
06:19:01.230 --> 06:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
to be the sending District um but
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that it's the sending District
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um for instance um
 
06:19:07.868 --> 06:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
Portsmith Elementary's cost per pupil as
 
06:19:11.910 --> 06:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
of 2024 was $26,000 about newcastle's
 
06:19:14.270 --> 06:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
right next door was 35,000 I mean I'm
 
06:19:14.280 --> 06:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
right next door was 35,000 I mean I'm
sorry

06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:19:18.510 --> 06:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
44,000 if Portsmith sends
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
80% to Newcastle because per student who
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
leaves Portsmith to go to Newcastle
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
Elementary um then Portsmouth is giving
 
06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
Newcastle $
 
06:19:32.990 --> 06:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
21,000 a year for those students while
 
06:19:35.190 --> 06:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
Newcastle taxpayers
 
06:19:38.510 --> 06:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
are paying 44,000 per year minus
 
06:19:39.628 --> 06:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
whatever is coming from the federal
 
06:19:41.708 --> 06:19:41.718 align:start position:0%
government um and the state government
 
06:19:44.510 --> 06:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so and I know this is the
 
06:19:47.628 --> 06:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
same uh formula that's already in the
 
06:19:50.190 --> 06:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
law but the law right now is voluntary
 
06:19:52.270 --> 06:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
and this makes it involuntary as I
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand it I don't think Newcastle
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
can say we don't want to participate
 
06:19:57.788 --> 06:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
because this is going to suddenly really
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
change our budget in a way we don't want
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
so um and and just one last thing is uh
 
06:20:06.990 --> 06:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
did I lose it whoops I think I left it
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
behind um oh it was never mind I had one
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
more point but somebody else raised it
 
06:20:14.830 --> 06:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
so those were my main issues about this
 
06:20:18.110 --> 06:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you any
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:38.750 --> 06:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:38.760 --> 06:20:45.548 align:start position:0%
 
good

06:20:45.548 --> 06:20:45.558 align:start position:0%

comes to enrollment options available to
 
06:21:31.948 --> 06:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
their children due to the timing of
 
06:21:34.590 --> 06:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
military directed moves military

additional subsequent relocations from
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%

06:22:19.788 --> 06:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this committee has an
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a highly impactful
 
06:22:23.548 --> 06:22:23.558 align:start position:0%
and positive effect on the educational
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
experiences of military connected
 
06:22:28.350 --> 06:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
children the Department of Defense is
 
06:22:30.390 --> 06:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
hopeful to discuss options to protect
 
06:22:32.070 --> 06:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the enrollment options for these
 
06:22:34.190 --> 06:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
families as such we have offered an
 
06:22:36.350 --> 06:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
amend m to the current bill which will
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
not change the general policy but
 
06:22:40.230 --> 06:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
clarify that military connected students
 
06:22:41.948 --> 06:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
would have preference over non-resident
 
06:22:43.708 --> 06:22:43.718 align:start position:0%
pupils should their parents be on active
 
06:22:46.510 --> 06:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
duty orders and clarifying that military
 
06:22:48.468 --> 06:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
connected students be exempt from school
 
06:22:51.030 --> 06:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
capacity limits basically speaking the
 
06:22:53.910 --> 06:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the amended language would
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
not uh or would retain current law so
 
06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
incurrent law military connected
 
06:23:00.468 --> 06:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
children have uh these available options
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
but it was stricken uh with house house
 
06:23:05.948 --> 06:23:05.958 align:start position:0%
bill 741 so the amend amended language
 
06:23:09.430 --> 06:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we have provided uh to uh the chair
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
would put uh those families back into uh
 
06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
the bill so in closing we are grateful
 
06:23:18.350 --> 06:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
for the tremendous efforts New Hampshire
 
06:23:20.110 --> 06:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
has historically made to support our
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
military families and service members we
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to support
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
the policies reflected in the bill and
 
06:23:28.788 --> 06:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank chairman cordelli for his
 
06:23:30.750 --> 06:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
willingness to review our proposed
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you for taking the time
 
06:23:34.708 --> 06:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
to consider and deliberate on this issue
 
06:23:36.510 --> 06:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
and at this time I stand ready to answer
 
06:23:38.868 --> 06:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have thank you
 
06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bon thank you madam chair
 
06:23:45.190 --> 06:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for typing my question um
 
06:23:49.110 --> 06:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
forgive me if I'm not as uh um
 
06:23:51.350 --> 06:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about what currently is
 
06:23:53.590 --> 06:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
provided for uh children of military
 
06:23:56.030 --> 06:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
families um you're talking about
 
06:23:58.510 --> 06:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
military families moving amongst
 
06:24:01.510 --> 06:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
different locations Statewide so across
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
the country from one duty station to
 
06:24:06.670 --> 06:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
another so those PCS moves the military
 
06:24:09.070 --> 06:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
family may move from San Diego
 
06:24:11.750 --> 06:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
California to uh the Portsmouth Naval
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
Shipyard so they may move to uh a res uh
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
residents in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:24:20.670 --> 06:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
followup so my question is I I'm not
 
06:24:22.430 --> 06:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
understanding how this would change
 
06:24:24.430 --> 06:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
anything because if you had a military
 
06:24:27.390 --> 06:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
family and they came and they say they
 
06:24:29.430 --> 06:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
came and they went to Portsmouth and
 
06:24:32.310 --> 06:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's where they're they're residing um
 
06:24:34.510 --> 06:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
06:24:35.990 --> 06:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
to San are you're talking about children
 
06:24:38.590 --> 06:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
that are left behind with family members
 
06:24:40.350 --> 06:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
being able to say because if if the
 
06:24:41.788 --> 06:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
family's moving to San Diego and then
 
06:24:43.948 --> 06:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
they move back why wouldn't they already
 
06:24:46.030 --> 06:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
be so under under current New Hampshire
 
06:24:48.270 --> 06:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
law military families have preference if
 
06:24:50.510 --> 06:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
their if their parents are are active
 
06:24:52.468 --> 06:24:52.478 align:start position:0%
duty service members so that that
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
service member is on orders uh that
 
06:24:57.708 --> 06:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
pupil has the ability to enroll in the
 
06:24:59.390 --> 06:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
school district of their choice no
 
06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
matter their residents because they may
 
06:25:03.230 --> 06:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
have moved from temporary to permanent
 
06:25:07.030 --> 06:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
housing so that family can register uh
 
06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
and enroll their child in the school
 
06:25:10.190 --> 06:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
district that they know they're going to
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
reside in this bill struck the military
 
06:25:16.948 --> 06:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh connected children out of uh this the
 
06:25:20.190 --> 06:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
statute um so we're trying to get it we
 
06:25:22.628 --> 06:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
are respectively asking the committee to
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
include the military family uh so that
 
06:25:27.750 --> 06:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
those children have access to open
 
06:25:30.468 --> 06:25:30.478 align:start position:0%
enrollment policies and retain those
 
06:25:32.310 --> 06:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
open enrollment options which are
 
06:25:34.830 --> 06:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire
 
06:25:37.670 --> 06:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
statute uh so just to be perfectly clear
 
06:25:40.350 --> 06:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is the original Bill
 
06:25:43.070 --> 06:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
took away that ability Andre you're just
 
06:25:45.270 --> 06:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
advocating for it to remain the same
 
06:25:46.830 --> 06:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank
 
06:25:49.788 --> 06:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Freeman thank you
 
06:25:51.270 --> 06:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you for coming in
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
front of us and um I I I don't know if
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
you were aware of the amendment that
 
06:25:58.830 --> 06:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli had put in which
 
06:26:00.430 --> 06:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
actually added the language right back
 
06:26:02.510 --> 06:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
into this bill yep we worked with the
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
chairman on that thank you thank you any
 
06:26:05.638 --> 06:26:07.350 align:start position:0%
chairman on that thank you thank you any
other

06:26:07.350 --> 06:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hall chair and
 
06:26:11.750 --> 06:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
06:26:14.150 --> 06:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
just curious on let's say when you said
 
06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
that they are exempt even if the school
 
06:26:18.750 --> 06:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
has reached capacity limits what happens
 
06:26:20.468 --> 06:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
I mean are there fire codes that say
 
06:26:21.868 --> 06:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
that a school district can only have so
 
06:26:23.990 --> 06:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
many students I maybe not I'm just
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
curious I'm unaware of those specifics
 
06:26:30.390 --> 06:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
but um broadly speaking the the roughly
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
17 states that have enacted some sort of
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
open enrollment for military to children
 
06:26:38.270 --> 06:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
have had that capacity uh limit revised
 
06:26:41.670 --> 06:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
so that those particular families um Can
 
06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
enroll their child due to those military
 
06:26:44.240 --> 06:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
enroll their child due to those military
service

06:26:45.110 --> 06:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:26:46.990 --> 06:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
orders thank
 
06:26:49.590 --> 06:26:49.600 align:start position:0%

06:26:55.548 --> 06:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:18.788 --> 06:27:18.798 align:start position:0%

Rino New Hampshire school boards
 
06:27:24.070 --> 06:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
Association excuse me we are opposed to
 
06:27:26.070 --> 06:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 741 I will follow up with
 
06:27:28.708 --> 06:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
written comments um as this is a similar
 
06:27:30.788 --> 06:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
Bill to Senate Bill 101 which was heard
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
in Senate education a few weeks ago and
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
I wrote written comments to that
 
06:27:36.510 --> 06:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
committee as well too so I can basically
 
06:27:38.430 --> 06:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
copy and paste I think I've got about
 
06:27:39.868 --> 06:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
five or six points that I want to
 
06:27:42.590 --> 06:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
identify um first create and I'll try
 
06:27:44.670 --> 06:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
not to read exactly from from my notes
 
06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
here um creating an open enrollment
 
06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
system a Statewide open enrollment
 
06:27:49.990 --> 06:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
system would interfere with dozens if
 
06:27:51.548 --> 06:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
not scores of existing tuition
 
06:27:54.430 --> 06:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
agreements that exist across the state
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
that have been duly bargained negotiated

and agreed to by Untold number of local
 
06:28:00.708 --> 06:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
school districts and school boards um
 
06:28:02.548 --> 06:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
more importantly many of these tuition
 
06:28:05.390 --> 06:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
agreements have um um a a requirement
 
06:28:07.948 --> 06:28:07.958 align:start position:0%
that the sending School District send a
 
06:28:09.868 --> 06:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
certain number or a certain percentage
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
of students to the receiving School
 
06:28:13.150 --> 06:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
District so the receiving School
 
06:28:14.830 --> 06:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
District can properly budget and they
 
06:28:15.948 --> 06:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
know how many kids they're going to be
 
06:28:18.948 --> 06:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
getting in any given year um the so the
 
06:28:20.830 --> 06:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill was silent on what we would do with
 
06:28:22.750 --> 06:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
those existing tuition contracts whether
 
06:28:24.868 --> 06:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
or not they expire whether or not the
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
state law would supersede them but it
 
06:28:29.310 --> 06:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
would create Havoc for the dozens if not
 
06:28:30.590 --> 06:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
scores of school districts that are
 
06:28:33.150 --> 06:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
already parties to um to to tuition
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
contracts and tuition agreements
 
06:28:35.280 --> 06:28:37.150 align:start position:0%
contracts and tuition agreements
Statewide

06:28:37.150 --> 06:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
06:28:42.070 --> 06:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
um page two lines 28 through 32 talks
 
06:28:45.788 --> 06:28:45.798 align:start position:0%
about um uh each month uh principal or
 
06:28:48.510 --> 06:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
or somebody's going to have to identify
 
06:28:50.548 --> 06:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
what the capacity of each school and
 
06:28:53.468 --> 06:28:53.478 align:start position:0%
each grade level is um and the capacity
 
06:28:54.708 --> 06:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
of each grade level the number of
 
06:28:57.510 --> 06:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies in each individual school um
 
06:29:00.270 --> 06:29:00.280 align:start position:0%
and HSB finds it paradoxical that many
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
bills across both Chambers um of the New
 
06:29:05.390 --> 06:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court last session and
 
06:29:07.150 --> 06:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
this session complained about school
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
districts having too many administrators
 
06:29:11.708 --> 06:29:11.718 align:start position:0%
um I can count to dozens of bills over
 
06:29:13.150 --> 06:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
the last number of years that just put
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
what I'll call busy work under the hands
 
06:29:17.310 --> 06:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
of school administrators rather than
 
06:29:19.150 --> 06:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
focusing on curriculum instruction or
 
06:29:21.788 --> 06:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
assessment and hsba would rather those
 
06:29:23.948 --> 06:29:23.958 align:start position:0%
administrators had time to focus on
 
06:29:25.628 --> 06:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
reading scores and writing scores and
 
06:29:28.628 --> 06:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
math scores and not filling out reports
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
um or filling out data to send to the
 
06:29:31.628 --> 06:29:31.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that has nothing
 
06:29:33.708 --> 06:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
to do with curriculum instruction or
 
06:29:37.350 --> 06:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
assess ment third uh page two line 30
 
06:29:39.350 --> 06:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
speaks to districts having to post the
 
06:29:42.510 --> 06:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
quote total capacity close quote of each
 
06:29:46.190 --> 06:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
individual School NHS nsba asks the
 
06:29:49.510 --> 06:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
total capacity of what is it student
 
06:29:51.628 --> 06:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
enrollment is it empty seats is it a
 
06:29:53.788 --> 06:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
school district's fiscal capacity we're
 
06:29:56.070 --> 06:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
coming up on annual meetings we know
 
06:29:57.190 --> 06:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
different districts have different
 
06:29:59.990 --> 06:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacities Staffing capacity
 
06:30:02.430 --> 06:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation capacity the bill is not
 
06:30:04.190 --> 06:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
clear and do not accurately reflect the
 
06:30:06.948 --> 06:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
numerous capacities in quotation marks
 
06:30:09.070 --> 06:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
that school districts have to
 
06:30:12.030 --> 06:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
encounter um fourth related to a school
 
06:30:15.150 --> 06:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
district's fiscal capacities um the bill
 
06:30:17.310 --> 06:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 741 does not adequately
 
06:30:19.510 --> 06:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
consider School District budgeting as I
 
06:30:22.070 --> 06:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
talked about with the with the the
 
06:30:24.110 --> 06:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
tuition contracts a school district or a
 
06:30:25.990 --> 06:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
school board has to know roughly how
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
many kids they're going to have in any
 
06:30:29.628 --> 06:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
given year so they can budget
 
06:30:32.548 --> 06:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
accordingly um my exam if this Builder
 
06:30:34.510 --> 06:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
were go through a school district would
 
06:30:36.390 --> 06:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
potentially have to potentially would
 
06:30:39.628 --> 06:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
potentially have to budget at 100% of
 
06:30:41.948 --> 06:30:41.958 align:start position:0%
the various capacities I mentioned
 
06:30:44.190 --> 06:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
preceding a school district with a
 
06:30:46.190 --> 06:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
student enrollment of 500 students but
 
06:30:48.270 --> 06:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
with a quote unquote capacity of 700
 
06:30:50.230 --> 06:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
students would have to budget for those
 
06:30:52.990 --> 06:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
700 students um this would not be
 
06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent and would play tax
 
06:30:57.190 --> 06:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
would play Havoc with local tax rates if
 
06:31:00.270 --> 06:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
we had kids coming and going um at will
 
06:31:02.830 --> 06:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
if you will without a clear concept or
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
clear notion of how many kids are going
 
06:31:06.548 --> 06:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
to be in a school district in any given
 
06:31:09.230 --> 06:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
in any given year
 
06:31:11.948 --> 06:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
um uh also related to I'll just call it
 
06:31:13.868 --> 06:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
the enrollment capacity or the capacity
 
06:31:17.750 --> 06:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
per classroom um what happens if
 
06:31:21.270 --> 06:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
nonresident students fill that capacity
 
06:31:23.590 --> 06:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
and then resident students move into
 
06:31:26.750 --> 06:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
that school district um are they given
 
06:31:28.430 --> 06:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
First Choice does the school district
 
06:31:31.270 --> 06:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to hire another teacher um
 
06:31:32.270 --> 06:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
is they're going to have to build
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
another Wing more par professionals it
 
06:31:36.910 --> 06:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
sort of gets to the total scope of this
 
06:31:38.788 --> 06:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
relative to how districts are going to
 
06:31:40.948 --> 06:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
budget in any given school year and what
 
06:31:43.430 --> 06:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
we mean by quote unquote capacity um but
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
the C bill is silent on on on these
 
06:31:49.430 --> 06:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
particular matters um last somebody had
 
06:31:51.628 --> 06:31:51.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned a great number of transient
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
students in in some of our communities
 
06:31:55.910 --> 06:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you know students who through
 
06:31:57.670 --> 06:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances are required
 
06:32:00.388 --> 06:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
to move to a dist District multiple
 
06:32:02.150 --> 06:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
district from District to District
 
06:32:04.548 --> 06:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
multiple times a year how this is that
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
our true reflection of the student
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
enrollment capacity that is that is that
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
is listed throughout the bill um you
 
06:32:13.070 --> 06:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
know further we'd also posit that having
 
06:32:14.430 --> 06:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
a significant number of transient
 
06:32:15.910 --> 06:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
students is not a true reflection of the
 
06:32:17.948 --> 06:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
district's sort of quote unquote
 
06:32:21.030 --> 06:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
capacity um last I'll leave you with um
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's another bill relative to is
 
06:32:25.628 --> 06:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 771 representative Pell's
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
bill was heard in um the Ed funding
 
06:32:31.388 --> 06:32:31.398 align:start position:0%
committee a week or so ago um maybe
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe two weeks ago at at this point
 
06:32:35.388 --> 06:32:35.398 align:start position:0%
also tweaking RSA
 
06:32:38.670 --> 06:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
194d um I should let you know that uh
 
06:32:40.110 --> 06:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative chairman cordelli
 
06:32:41.548 --> 06:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned the prospect Mountain School
 
06:32:44.030 --> 06:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
District and he received an email or a
 
06:32:45.468 --> 06:32:45.478 align:start position:0%
letter from the superintendent of that
 
06:32:48.230 --> 06:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
school district um there is ongoing
 
06:32:50.708 --> 06:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
litigation between Prospect mountain and
 
06:32:52.430 --> 06:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
another school district relative to the
 
06:32:55.070 --> 06:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the current open and R
 
06:32:57.628 --> 06:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
Roman bill um uh the current open and
 
06:33:00.548 --> 06:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
Roman statute if you will um to my
 
06:33:01.990 --> 06:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's still pending before
 
06:33:05.548 --> 06:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court um so
 
06:33:08.110 --> 06:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
there just there's issues over who has
 
06:33:10.190 --> 06:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
the obligation to pay without prior
 
06:33:12.750 --> 06:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
notice to a school district what happens
 
06:33:15.430 --> 06:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
if a parent unilaterally changes places
 
06:33:17.070 --> 06:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
CH changes placements relative to
 
06:33:19.510 --> 06:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
special education Transportation so on
 
06:33:21.910 --> 06:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth so um it's a complicated
 
06:33:24.750 --> 06:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
matter um I raised some issues and some
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
some concerns NH hsba has with the bill
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you'd like I can follow up with
 
06:33:30.190 --> 06:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony um but that will
 
06:33:32.070 --> 06:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'm happy to
 
06:33:33.430 --> 06:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
06:33:34.510 --> 06:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
may have
 
06:33:36.548 --> 06:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McDonald thank
 
06:33:38.948 --> 06:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
you chairwoman Noble and thank you again
 
06:33:40.910 --> 06:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony does your
 
06:33:43.910 --> 06:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
organization have any connections to
 
06:33:46.230 --> 06:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
other states that have done this and
 
06:33:47.830 --> 06:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
have been able to do it successfully
 
06:33:48.750 --> 06:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:33:51.150 --> 06:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative um that was mentioned in
 
06:33:53.150 --> 06:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Ed as well too that a number of
 
06:33:56.030 --> 06:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
states have these open enrollment um
 
06:33:58.270 --> 06:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions um I know one number was
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
floated and Senate I don't know what it
 
06:34:01.868 --> 06:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
is I do have connections where I can do
 
06:34:04.150 --> 06:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
some research and find that out quickly
 
06:34:06.548 --> 06:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
I can get that how accurate how in
 
06:34:09.708 --> 06:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
totality um nhba does not have a lot of
 
06:34:12.430 --> 06:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
capacity with only four staff members so
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
I can certainly try and do some research
 
06:34:16.110 --> 06:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
I know I'm sure representative Cordell I
 
06:34:17.590 --> 06:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
know he's very thorough in his research
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
as well too I can see what I can find
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
out and pass belong to the committee
 
06:34:23.190 --> 06:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
though thank you thank you
 
06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
06:34:30.030 --> 06:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
question I have two if I may Madam chair
 
06:34:33.070 --> 06:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
sure okay thank you um first question is
 
06:34:35.150 --> 06:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to the hiring process do you
 
06:34:36.910 --> 06:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
have any concerns that that process
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
could become hurried or rushed in the
 
06:34:40.468 --> 06:34:40.478 align:start position:0%
event that school census numbers would
 
06:34:42.430 --> 06:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
change or fluctuate on a month-to-month
 
06:34:44.430 --> 06:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
basis thank thank for the question
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
representative I hadn't contemplated or
 
06:34:48.548 --> 06:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
considered that and I forget if if the
 
06:34:50.708 --> 06:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill just does the bill have a deadline
 
06:34:52.230 --> 06:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
as to when you have
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
to quote unquote transfer or is it at
 
06:34:57.830 --> 06:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
any time I mean if it's at any time you
 
06:35:00.990 --> 06:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
know it it it it it would it would
 
06:35:03.910 --> 06:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
potentially be problematic or CA a
 
06:35:05.948 --> 06:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
district with Staffing with a local
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
issue I mean you know we have a shortage
 
06:35:10.910 --> 06:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
of not a shortage of certified teachers
 
06:35:13.948 --> 06:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
per se but you know once you get into
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
May June July and August it's hard to
 
06:35:18.788 --> 06:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
find teachers especially with specific
 
06:35:21.990 --> 06:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know um expertise if you will Math
 
06:35:23.388 --> 06:35:23.398 align:start position:0%
teachers science teachers are hard to
 
06:35:25.868 --> 06:35:25.878 align:start position:0%
come by um the other aspect too is
 
06:35:26.948 --> 06:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
depending on the needs of that
 
06:35:29.430 --> 06:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
individual child I don't know any school
 
06:35:31.230 --> 06:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
district in New Hampshire that is at
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
quote unquote full capacity with the
 
06:35:34.590 --> 06:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
number of par professionals that they
 
06:35:38.030 --> 06:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
need um so you know a kid moves in
 
06:35:40.750 --> 06:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
changes School let's say over Christmas
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
break and they they show up on January
 
06:35:45.708 --> 06:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
2nd but that kid's IEP says they need a
 
06:35:48.670 --> 06:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
one-on-one or or or supportive help in a
 
06:35:50.750 --> 06:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
school in in their in their classroom
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
that could be a significant
 
06:35:55.510 --> 06:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
Challenge and second question thank you
 
06:35:57.910 --> 06:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair is with regard to something
 
06:35:59.708 --> 06:35:59.718 align:start position:0%
that I had just been thinking as we were
 
06:36:01.750 --> 06:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
talking here could this bill
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
unintentionally impact uh matters of
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
like children child and family law like
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
custody agreements like who has
 
06:36:11.270 --> 06:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to enroll their child in a
 
06:36:12.990 --> 06:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
in an in a place yeah thank you for the
 
06:36:15.388 --> 06:36:15.398 align:start position:0%
question uh representative I have
 
06:36:17.310 --> 06:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
limited knowledge of sort of what I'll
 
06:36:18.868 --> 06:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
just call the divorce proceedings and
 
06:36:21.628 --> 06:36:21.638 align:start position:0%
the parenting plans there is a provision
 
06:36:24.670 --> 06:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
currently in the um in the in the
 
06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
current residency statute RSA 193 CO2
 
06:36:32.310 --> 06:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
that does say that um that the if a
 
06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
parents are divorced and liveing in
 
06:36:36.150 --> 06:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
different towns that the parents can
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
choose what school the child will attend
 
06:36:42.628 --> 06:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
um and I mean I think I don't know I'm
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is anecdotally um you know I don't
 
06:36:48.750 --> 06:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
never practice divorce law I think that
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that the parenting plans will
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
generally say that you know Mom has a
 
06:36:55.430 --> 06:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know the child will live with Mom
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
and attend the the school where mom
 
06:37:00.030 --> 06:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
lives or the child will child will live
 
06:37:01.910 --> 06:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
with Mom and attend where mom lives or
 
06:37:03.150 --> 06:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
the child will live with Dad and attend
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
school where the dad lives however I
 
06:37:06.670 --> 06:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
know the parties are at least free to
 
06:37:08.230 --> 06:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
determine themselves where the child's
 
06:37:11.628 --> 06:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
going to attend but you know if that
 
06:37:12.990 --> 06:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's more of a divorce
 
06:37:15.388 --> 06:37:15.398 align:start position:0%
law issue than it is necessarily an open
 
06:37:18.590 --> 06:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment or a school law issue yeah I
 
06:37:19.510 --> 06:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to say anything that that
 
06:37:20.388 --> 06:37:20.398 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
inaccurate y any other
 
06:37:26.628 --> 06:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:37:40.510 --> 06:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:42.110 --> 06:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman my name is
 
06:37:44.388 --> 06:37:44.398 align:start position:0%
David and committee members hello uh my
 
06:37:45.868 --> 06:37:45.878 align:start position:0%
name is David Trumble I'm from the town
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
of where uh I have concerns about this
 
06:37:50.510 --> 06:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill and there's I guess three of them
 
06:37:52.190 --> 06:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
the first is I think that it would
 
06:37:55.110 --> 06:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the inequities in New
 
06:37:57.628 --> 06:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's system as has been mentioned
 
06:37:59.590 --> 06:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
open enrollment as a concept is based on
 
06:38:01.990 --> 06:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of choice that every child
 
06:38:04.310 --> 06:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
should have a choice but that's only
 
06:38:06.868 --> 06:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
going to be fair if every child has the
 
06:38:09.190 --> 06:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get adequate education in
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
their home school the first necessary
 
06:38:14.830 --> 06:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
step in order to have a fair open
 
06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment program would be that every
 
06:38:19.270 --> 06:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
homeschool provides every child with an
 
06:38:21.788 --> 06:38:21.798 align:start position:0%
adequate education one of the states
 
06:38:23.788 --> 06:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
that does open enrollment is Michigan
 
06:38:25.788 --> 06:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
and according to the latest statistics
 
06:38:28.510 --> 06:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
from the US Census they provide as a
 
06:38:32.830 --> 06:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
state 55% of the funds for their schools
 
06:38:35.548 --> 06:38:35.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by that same data is
 
06:38:38.190 --> 06:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
27.9% so they're providing twice as much
 
06:38:41.548 --> 06:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
as we do so in Michigan every single
 
06:38:43.830 --> 06:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
school is reasonably well funded so you
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the issue of Haves and Have
 
06:38:48.030 --> 06:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
Not so you wouldn't have people wanting
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
to flee a school because it's so
 
06:38:52.270 --> 06:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
massively underfunded but that would
 
06:38:53.788 --> 06:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
certainly happen in New
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um if you look at New
 
06:38:57.910 --> 06:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the unique feature that makes
 
06:39:00.110 --> 06:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
up our school system is the heavier
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
Reliance on the property taxes it's the
 
06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
heaviest in any state in America we are
 
06:39:08.230 --> 06:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
the lowest spending state of all 50
 
06:39:10.910 --> 06:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
states we give 27% of the funds to the
 
06:39:13.150 --> 06:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
schools from the state we're at the
 
06:39:15.510 --> 06:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
bottom we are the last state that's
 
06:39:18.548 --> 06:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
ready for an open enrollment policy even
 
06:39:21.468 --> 06:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
if you think it's a good idea step one
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be to fund the public schools
 
06:39:26.230 --> 06:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
adequately first once that happens then
 
06:39:28.190 --> 06:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
you could say okay maybe open enrollment
 
06:39:29.750 --> 06:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
would work but as long as you have gross
 
06:39:31.628 --> 06:39:31.638 align:start position:0%
in equities it won't work just look at
 
06:39:33.750 --> 06:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
some schools in the state can only spend
 
06:39:37.150 --> 06:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
$14,000 a pupil the average is 21,000
 
06:39:39.868 --> 06:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
some spend 30 or 40,000 why is that
 
06:39:41.948 --> 06:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
because their local property tax base
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
isn't high enough what's the result of
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that educationally look at the
 
06:39:48.868 --> 06:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores at the doe Newport
 
06:39:50.670 --> 06:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
less than 10% of the kids are at
 
06:39:52.868 --> 06:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
category three or four out of 1 2 three
 
06:39:55.590 --> 06:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
and four of proficiency Charlestown 10%
 
06:39:59.270 --> 06:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont 18% where 22% Statewide
 
06:40:02.190 --> 06:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
average is just a little short of 40%
 
06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford 69
 
06:40:07.310 --> 06:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton 61% conquered 54% sunap I
 
06:40:09.110 --> 06:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't have it but I know it's quite High
 
06:40:11.270 --> 06:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
the point being that children who live
 
06:40:14.910 --> 06:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
in Newport could easily say CIP is next
 
06:40:17.948 --> 06:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
door I want to go there because they
 
06:40:20.590 --> 06:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
have a tax base that can support a good
 
06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
school this would be exacerbating the
 
06:40:27.750 --> 06:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
diff differences the lowincome family in
 
06:40:29.948 --> 06:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
Newport who can't transport their child
 
06:40:31.788 --> 06:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
all the way over to stie but can easily
 
06:40:33.310 --> 06:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
take their child to a bus in Newport
 
06:40:35.030 --> 06:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
report they're not going to be eligible
 
06:40:37.548 --> 06:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
to participate in this children who have
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
discipline problems are not going to be
 
06:40:41.670 --> 06:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in this we know
 
06:40:43.150 --> 06:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
the studies show that children with
 
06:40:45.708 --> 06:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities are expelled have have
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
discipline issues at schools I should
 
06:40:49.388 --> 06:40:49.398 align:start position:0%
say at a much higher rate two three four
 
06:40:50.830 --> 06:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
or five times higher than children
 
06:40:53.430 --> 06:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
without disabilities children of color
 
06:40:56.910 --> 06:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
for for the same behaviors EG uh using
 
06:40:58.190 --> 06:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
their cell phone in class are
 
06:41:00.030 --> 06:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
disciplined at a much higher rate five
 
06:41:02.590 --> 06:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
to 10 times more than white children so
 
06:41:03.670 --> 06:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is you're going
 
06:41:05.350 --> 06:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
to have some children who cannot
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
participate in this program because the
 
06:41:09.110 --> 06:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
reasons why you can deny somebody is
 
06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
they they have discipline problems
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
people who can't access it because of of
 
06:41:14.750 --> 06:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation you're going to and and
 
06:41:16.868 --> 06:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
then 80% of the money for the children
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
who do leave those whose parents can
 
06:41:20.910 --> 06:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
afford to go over to the town that
 
06:41:22.868 --> 06:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
spends a lot of money on their schools
 
06:41:25.590 --> 06:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
80% of the money goes with them so now
 
06:41:28.070 --> 06:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
Newport has even less money to educate
 
06:41:30.388 --> 06:41:30.398 align:start position:0%
the children who are left behind if the
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire did its job and
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
funded every every school adequately
 
06:41:37.388 --> 06:41:37.398 align:start position:0%
then you could see a case for open
 
06:41:39.190 --> 06:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment but you wouldn't see as many
 
06:41:40.948 --> 06:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
people wanting to flee that Newport
 
06:41:43.830 --> 06:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
school as you would right now until you
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
adequately do job one it's premature for
 
06:41:49.190 --> 06:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
this one my second concern is that this
 
06:41:51.110 --> 06:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
tramples all over local control a
 
06:41:52.830 --> 06:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
question was asked would it reduce local
 
06:41:55.510 --> 06:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
control and the answer was no it it
 
06:41:57.948 --> 06:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduces local control right
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
now you have a voluntary open enrollment
 
06:42:01.868 --> 06:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire that's the
 
06:42:03.868 --> 06:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
perfect solution in a state that doesn't
 
06:42:06.030 --> 06:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
have state funding for the schools
 
06:42:08.350 --> 06:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
voluntary if a town wants to open its
 
06:42:11.150 --> 06:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
doors to more students they can do that
 
06:42:14.590 --> 06:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
in the present system this bill reduces
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
and takes away local control and forces
 
06:42:19.350 --> 06:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
that on everybody also has been
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned the issue of budgeting every
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
school district goes through their their
 
06:42:24.830 --> 06:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
budgets and their pages and Pages how
 
06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
would you budget for this you have to
 
06:42:28.990 --> 06:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
budget by year but every month you have
 
06:42:31.070 --> 06:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
to send in capacity differences there's
 
06:42:32.830 --> 06:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
no way that you could properly budget
 
06:42:35.150 --> 06:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
for either the school board is going to
 
06:42:37.510 --> 06:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
over budget and think oh what if we get
 
06:42:39.070 --> 06:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of new people who come in
 
06:42:40.910 --> 06:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
students and they don't come in but
 
06:42:42.788 --> 06:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
you're still taxing at that rate your
 
06:42:45.310 --> 06:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to be IR rate that's
 
06:42:46.990 --> 06:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
not fair to them to have to be taxed at
 
06:42:48.150 --> 06:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
that rate or they're going to under
 
06:42:49.948 --> 06:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
budget the problem with that is that
 
06:42:51.548 --> 06:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
most schools small schools will leave a
 
06:42:53.190 --> 06:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
couple of slots open because they know
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
some people are going to move in during
 
06:42:57.230 --> 06:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
the year but now if they under budget
 
06:42:58.510 --> 06:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
they won't have the money for those
 
06:43:00.350 --> 06:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
right now they have a system they can
 
06:43:02.190 --> 06:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
budget for what they can budget for they
 
06:43:04.430 --> 06:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
know they live a couple spots open this
 
06:43:06.548 --> 06:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
this bill would trample all over the for
 
06:43:08.388 --> 06:43:08.398 align:start position:0%
the local people the local school
 
06:43:10.270 --> 06:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
budgets trying to manage what they're
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
doing the other question that comes up
 
06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
is what about a fifth grader who
 
06:43:16.430 --> 06:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
transfers in to another school and then
 
06:43:18.070 --> 06:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
says I like it over there in that middle
 
06:43:21.190 --> 06:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
school but the next year that district
 
06:43:23.388 --> 06:43:23.398 align:start position:0%
has people who move into the town and
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
fill up all their slots so now that is
 
06:43:26.868 --> 06:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
does that student have a right to go
 
06:43:28.948 --> 06:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
there for sixth seventh and eighth grade
 
06:43:30.830 --> 06:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
or is it an annual thing if you're not
 
06:43:33.150 --> 06:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
the resident of the school so it this
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
isn't really contemplated in any of the
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
things just lastly to finish up there
 
06:43:38.990 --> 06:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
was a question about people who get
 
06:43:41.070 --> 06:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
arrested for using the wrong address I
 
06:43:42.468 --> 06:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
mean the reason why somebody would do
 
06:43:43.990 --> 06:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire is because they
 
06:43:46.670 --> 06:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
know that that address has a really
 
06:43:48.910 --> 06:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
strong school system but if you're not
 
06:43:52.670 --> 06:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
living there you're not paying your your
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
family nuclear unit is not living there
 
06:43:56.388 --> 06:43:56.398 align:start position:0%
you're not paying the property taxes to
 
06:43:58.190 --> 06:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
support that really good school system
 
06:44:00.510 --> 06:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why if we it's because
 
06:44:02.468 --> 06:44:02.478 align:start position:0%
we don't adequately fund our schools
 
06:44:03.670 --> 06:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
then the other question was about
 
06:44:05.230 --> 06:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments there's some
 
06:44:07.708 --> 06:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
schools that want more students those
 
06:44:10.150 --> 06:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
schools can do that right now under
 
06:44:11.948 --> 06:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
current law because you have voluntary
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
open enrollment if a school wants to do
 
06:44:17.190 --> 06:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
it they can do it now this bill forces
 
06:44:18.910 --> 06:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
every school to do it and it's going to
 
06:44:20.830 --> 06:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
create chaos in our school system and
 
06:44:22.628 --> 06:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
most importantly it will just exacerbate
 
06:44:24.430 --> 06:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
the inequalities that's the greatest
 
06:44:26.150 --> 06:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire's education is
 
06:44:28.388 --> 06:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
the inequalities between the Haves and
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
the Have Not school systems until you
 
06:44:32.670 --> 06:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
solve that this is It's that's the first
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
step then you can consider open
 
06:44:35.708 --> 06:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
enrollment at least that's would be my
 
06:44:37.990 --> 06:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you thank you any
 
06:44:40.030 --> 06:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murray thank
 
06:44:41.430 --> 06:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um and thank you for
 
06:44:43.150 --> 06:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question to you
 
06:44:44.990 --> 06:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
would be I I think based on what you
 
06:44:47.628 --> 06:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
were saying would it be accurate to say
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you're there's a concern regarding
 
06:44:52.868 --> 06:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
further segregating either through
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status or are historically
 
06:44:57.548 --> 06:44:57.558 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities that that would
 
06:45:00.110 --> 06:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
increase based If This Were to move
 
06:45:02.110 --> 06:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
forward in that way absolutely because
 
06:45:04.788 --> 06:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
in a town every town has different
 
06:45:06.910 --> 06:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic statuses and students who
 
06:45:08.628 --> 06:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
have disabilities and those who don't
 
06:45:11.230 --> 06:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
but people would be those who have more
 
06:45:12.830 --> 06:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
money would be able to access the
 
06:45:15.030 --> 06:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
driving and the transportation and those
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
whose children have not been uh
 
06:45:18.830 --> 06:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
disciplined would be able to access so
 
06:45:21.388 --> 06:45:21.398 align:start position:0%
the people who would get left behind uh
 
06:45:23.510 --> 06:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be low-income families and
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
students who have discipline issues so
 
06:45:27.628 --> 06:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to even exacerbate even
 
06:45:30.310 --> 06:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
more the halves and the have
 
06:45:33.310 --> 06:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
knots any other questions
 
06:45:35.468 --> 06:45:35.478 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you madam
 
06:45:37.548 --> 06:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
chair and welcome back to education Mr
 
06:45:40.110 --> 06:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
tble nice to see you uh the sponsor
 
06:45:43.270 --> 06:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there we have no reason
 
06:45:45.670 --> 06:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
to expect a bus load of students or at
 
06:45:48.030 --> 06:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
least he doesn't expect that and if
 
06:45:49.150 --> 06:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
that's the case we're talking a
 
06:45:51.070 --> 06:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of
 
06:45:53.548 --> 06:45:53.558 align:start position:0%
students and you use the word exasperate
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
so how would a small number of students
 
06:45:57.990 --> 06:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this cause chaos and
 
06:46:00.030 --> 06:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
exasperate the system if it's just a
 
06:46:02.910 --> 06:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
small number and the other school was
 
06:46:05.030 --> 06:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
willing to take a few they could do that
 
06:46:07.350 --> 06:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
right now so if the town that has a
 
06:46:09.830 --> 06:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
great well-funded school system says oh
 
06:46:11.190 --> 06:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
we could handle five more and they were
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
willing to do that they could do that
 
06:46:15.468 --> 06:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
right now but by mandating it you you
 
06:46:17.230 --> 06:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
force every school every month to come
 
06:46:18.948 --> 06:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
up with a number of slots that they're
 
06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
going to have in in every uh every every
 
06:46:25.388 --> 06:46:25.398 align:start position:0%
classroom so there's no guarantee that
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a significant number um
 
06:46:30.868 --> 06:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
you you could easily see parents in a
 
06:46:33.548 --> 06:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
town that has a struggling functioning
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
school system say this is my ticket out
 
06:46:38.948 --> 06:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
and so they could they could very easily
 
06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
try and access this system and I'm not
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
saying those kids don't deserve a great
 
06:46:45.430 --> 06:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
education my point is that every child
 
06:46:47.830 --> 06:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
deserves a great education and if we
 
06:46:49.388 --> 06:46:49.398 align:start position:0%
only funded them in the first place
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
where they were they wouldn't say I want
 
06:46:52.910 --> 06:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
to get out of my school system okay
 
06:46:56.350 --> 06:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr triple yeah any other
 
06:46:59.388 --> 06:46:59.398 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:47:18.670 --> 06:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:20.230 --> 06:47:20.240 align:start position:0%

teachers New Hampshire I'm here to speak
 
06:47:33.270 --> 06:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
against uh House Bill 741 we have oppose
 
06:47:36.670 --> 06:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
this bill because it is a mandate um we
 
06:47:37.990 --> 06:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to support this
 
06:47:40.350 --> 06:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
bill but as a previous speaker said we
 
06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
cannot support this bill until all of
 
06:47:44.548 --> 06:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
our students in the grand state have the
 
06:47:46.830 --> 06:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity of a great robust public
 
06:47:50.190 --> 06:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
education in every single um local
 
06:47:51.670 --> 06:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Public School in every
 
06:47:54.110 --> 06:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
school district since the state is not
 
06:47:56.190 --> 06:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
meeting its constitutional obligation to
 
06:47:58.990 --> 06:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
fund that and that opportunity varies
 
06:48:01.750 --> 06:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
widely from one District to another
 
06:48:04.270 --> 06:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
because they are currently funded 70%
 
06:48:08.468 --> 06:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
with local property tax um money we
 
06:48:11.388 --> 06:48:11.398 align:start position:0%
cannot support open enrollment um if we
 
06:48:12.788 --> 06:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
can fix that first problem we can have
 
06:48:15.750 --> 06:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
this conversation maybe in a few years
 
06:48:19.190 --> 06:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay um but this is a mandate it does
 
06:48:21.548 --> 06:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
require local districts to adopt an open
 
06:48:24.830 --> 06:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment policy and to allow for
 
06:48:27.628 --> 06:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
transfers between districts unless there
 
06:48:30.388 --> 06:48:30.398 align:start position:0%
is not capacity or the student has a
 
06:48:33.990 --> 06:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
discipline issue or an absentee issue um
 
06:48:37.388 --> 06:48:37.398 align:start position:0%
that means that the sending district has
 
06:48:39.910 --> 06:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
to agree to send and the receiving
 
06:48:42.750 --> 06:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
district has to agree to receive um
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
previous you know currently that is
 
06:48:48.030 --> 06:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
something that they can work out
 
06:48:49.750 --> 06:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
considering the best interest of that
 
06:48:53.070 --> 06:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
particular student but also the
 
06:48:57.150 --> 06:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
um needs of the receiving school when
 
06:48:59.270 --> 06:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
they look at the other students in the
 
06:49:01.150 --> 06:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
classroom that receive that student the
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
staff level they have whether they they
 
06:49:06.948 --> 06:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
can meet the academic and um you know
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
social behavioral needs of the student
 
06:49:10.468 --> 06:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
coming in as well as all the other
 
06:49:11.948 --> 06:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
students in the classroom so they can
 
06:49:13.830 --> 06:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
balance all of those things out and if
 
06:49:16.150 --> 06:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
it works out they usually will agree but
 
06:49:18.430 --> 06:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have to this law if it pass
 
06:49:19.990 --> 06:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill if it passes would make it a
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to so yes it is uh stepping on
 
06:49:24.230 --> 06:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:49:26.910 --> 06:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
06:49:31.150 --> 06:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
see so when I look at this I think about
 
06:49:33.350 --> 06:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
how it would play out in my school
 
06:49:34.910 --> 06:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
district I live in
 
06:49:38.030 --> 06:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hudson and we are one of the lower
 
06:49:40.110 --> 06:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
funded school districts in the area we
 
06:49:42.468 --> 06:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
are a town that uh struggles with
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
property taxes we don't have a big tax
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
base um we
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
provide as good at education as we can
 
06:49:51.990 --> 06:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
with that tax base we don't have a lot
 
06:49:54.510 --> 06:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
of extras we go through our deliber
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
deliberative session every year and have
 
06:50:00.030 --> 06:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
a list of well we can afford this but
 
06:50:01.990 --> 06:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to wait that's
 
06:50:03.750 --> 06:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait you know we we
 
06:50:05.548 --> 06:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
pinch every penny till ex
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
screams um so if this passed I could see
 
06:50:13.948 --> 06:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
there would be a number of families in
 
06:50:15.788 --> 06:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
Hudson who would love to be able to
 
06:50:17.590 --> 06:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
transfer their students to Windam next
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
door because Windom and their
 
06:50:20.638 --> 06:50:22.270 align:start position:0%
door because Windom and their
taxpayers

06:50:22.270 --> 06:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
have invested in their school system and
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
been able to because they have a tax
 
06:50:32.628 --> 06:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
base that is better able to support
 
06:50:35.150 --> 06:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
lower class sizes investing in more
 
06:50:37.708 --> 06:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
teachers and Par professionals investing
 
06:50:40.388 --> 06:50:40.398 align:start position:0%
in a wider variety of programs at their
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools particularly the
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
middle and high school okay I love our
 
06:50:45.948 --> 06:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
high school I love our middle school but
 
06:50:48.868 --> 06:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
they offer more in Windom and I know
 
06:50:50.750 --> 06:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
that many of our families in Hudson
 
06:50:52.868 --> 06:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to just cross that
 
06:50:55.350 --> 06:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
line not all of them would be able to
 
06:50:56.750 --> 06:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
because we have students who have
 
06:50:58.388 --> 06:50:58.398 align:start position:0%
discipline issues we have students who
 
06:51:01.150 --> 06:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
have uh absenteeism issues we have
 
06:51:02.788 --> 06:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
students with special needs who maybe
 
06:51:05.708 --> 06:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
would try and go next door um we'd still
 
06:51:08.350 --> 06:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
have to bear the cost of providing
 
06:51:09.830 --> 06:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
services for
 
06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
them we would still have to keep the
 
06:51:16.110 --> 06:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
students with absentee issues with um
 
06:51:20.270 --> 06:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
behavior issues uh discipline issues and
 
06:51:21.990 --> 06:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure our taxpayers would see
 
06:51:23.548 --> 06:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
any relief of course we'd have to send
 
06:51:25.910 --> 06:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
80% of the money we wouldn't have any
 
06:51:28.510 --> 06:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
chance to negotiate that either that's
 
06:51:32.830 --> 06:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
another imposition on local control
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
um because there'd be no negotiation
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
between us and Windam and I don't know
 
06:51:40.230 --> 06:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers of Windam would
 
06:51:43.070 --> 06:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
want all of the students that would want
 
06:51:46.510 --> 06:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
to come either yeah I understand the the
 
06:51:49.868 --> 06:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor has said that the um local
 
06:51:52.830 --> 06:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
school district is allowed to Define
 
06:51:55.430 --> 06:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
capacity that's not made clear in this
 
06:52:00.270 --> 06:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
bill um because it it just says Identify
 
06:52:03.150 --> 06:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
capacity so you could also read it to
 
06:52:05.468 --> 06:52:05.478 align:start position:0%
as is outlined in the minimum standards
 
06:52:06.708 --> 06:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
for public schools that were just
 
06:52:09.708 --> 06:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
adopted which is just a Flatout number
 
06:52:13.030 --> 06:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
of you know certified adults to students
 
06:52:16.310 --> 06:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the grade level across the building
 
06:52:20.910 --> 06:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
um so that is unclear from the bill um
 
06:52:23.030 --> 06:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
anyway Windam has invested in their
 
06:52:24.510 --> 06:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
schools at a certain rate and I don't
 
06:52:26.310 --> 06:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
know if they necessarily want an influx
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
of students either um I've been told
 
06:52:31.868 --> 06:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
from you know professionals who work in
 
06:52:33.430 --> 06:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
the wind School system that they're not
 
06:52:36.628 --> 06:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to tuition their own students in
 
06:52:39.468 --> 06:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
um their own children so I don't know
 
06:52:41.868 --> 06:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
they want a lot of people coming from
 
06:52:41.878 --> 06:52:42.868 align:start position:0%
they want a lot of people coming from
another

06:52:42.868 --> 06:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
town we we oppose this bill it's not
 
06:52:47.430 --> 06:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's also not good because you can't
 
06:52:49.150 --> 06:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
plan for the students who are going to
 
06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
be in your class if you don't know who
 
06:52:53.868 --> 06:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
they're going to be from month to month
 
06:52:55.590 --> 06:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
you have a hard time making sure you
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
have the people to support their
 
06:53:01.548 --> 06:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
academic needs the resources and
 
06:53:03.388 --> 06:53:03.398 align:start position:0%
curriculum to support their academic
 
06:53:07.230 --> 06:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
needs it's bad from so many perspectives
 
06:53:08.750 --> 06:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
we would love to be able to support it
 
06:53:10.590 --> 06:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
but you've got to fix it so that every
 
06:53:13.270 --> 06:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
single school is able to offer the same
 
06:53:15.628 --> 06:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
robust level of public education then we
 
06:53:17.910 --> 06:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
can talk about you know helping with
 
06:53:20.948 --> 06:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
Geographic uh transfers to better meet
 
06:53:23.230 --> 06:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
whatever family's needs are and that's
 
06:53:25.430 --> 06:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony thank you thank you any
 
06:53:27.910 --> 06:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent muray thank you
 
06:53:29.548 --> 06:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:53:31.548 --> 06:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
question I have a question about whether
 
06:53:33.628 --> 06:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
or not through survey data you may have
 
06:53:35.750 --> 06:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
compiled over the years do you have any
 
06:53:38.110 --> 06:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
idea of of how many families might
 
06:53:40.190 --> 06:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
experience an undue hardship maybe
 
06:53:42.350 --> 06:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
having access to no car one car
 
06:53:46.388 --> 06:53:46.398 align:start position:0%
multi-work parents uh and how they would
 
06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
navigate transportation in this
 
06:53:52.270 --> 06:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance I don't have any survey
 
06:53:55.230 --> 06:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
data I know in my years of teaching we
 
06:53:58.750 --> 06:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
had many families at my school in
 
06:54:03.868 --> 06:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
nashaa who would have one car or no car
 
06:54:06.388 --> 06:54:06.398 align:start position:0%
in the family it was a struggle to get
 
06:54:08.830 --> 06:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
them to arrange for rides to get
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
families to parent teacher night I
 
06:54:12.510 --> 06:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
worked in elementary school so we
 
06:54:13.868 --> 06:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
usually have high attended to parent
 
06:54:14.990 --> 06:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
teacher nights they want to come see the
 
06:54:16.310 --> 06:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
projects they want to come meet the
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
teacher they they want to come enjoy a
 
06:54:20.628 --> 06:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
snack um you know it's a good time
 
06:54:23.788 --> 06:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
usually and we would feed feed uh the
 
06:54:25.388 --> 06:54:25.398 align:start position:0%
family's dinner we would that was always
 
06:54:27.788 --> 06:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
part of our parent teacher night um
 
06:54:30.030 --> 06:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
there'd be a dinner in the cafeteria and
 
06:54:32.510 --> 06:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
and all the uh displays and projects and
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
the kids would come and show off the
 
06:54:35.868 --> 06:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
classroom and the projects so it was a
 
06:54:37.910 --> 06:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
good positive things as well as talking
 
06:54:39.990 --> 06:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
about you know how your kid is doing and
 
06:54:42.070 --> 06:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and and and that part of it but we
 
06:54:45.070 --> 06:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
would have our homeschool
 
06:54:49.750 --> 06:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator um having to work
 
06:54:53.030 --> 06:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
with people she knew that lived in the
 
06:54:55.708 --> 06:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to get rid for some of our
 
06:54:57.990 --> 06:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
families because you know this one's car
 
06:55:00.350 --> 06:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
broke down that one didn't have a car
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
luckily I lived in Nashville some of
 
06:55:03.468 --> 06:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
them would live you know close enough to
 
06:55:06.788 --> 06:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
a bus line they could come but um last
 
06:55:09.990 --> 06:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
few years buses don't run that late it
 
06:55:13.868 --> 06:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
you know it's a problem um I don't have
 
06:55:15.548 --> 06:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
hard data like I can't tell you what
 
06:55:17.868 --> 06:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
percentage I just know it was something
 
06:55:18.948 --> 06:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
that would
 
06:55:21.670 --> 06:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
affect a number of families every year
 
06:55:24.310 --> 06:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
and was always a chore that The
 
06:55:26.910 --> 06:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
Homeschool coordinator had to arrange so
 
06:55:29.708 --> 06:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
that the families could come participate
 
06:55:31.948 --> 06:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
in their child education and and meet
 
06:55:33.590 --> 06:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
and talk with us which they really want
 
06:55:38.110 --> 06:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:41.070 --> 06:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
them can you imagine or or would you
 
06:55:43.150 --> 06:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
envision that this might not just be an
 
06:55:44.948 --> 06:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
urban issue it could also be a rural
 
06:55:47.350 --> 06:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
issue for Rural access to Transportation
 
06:55:49.468 --> 06:55:49.478 align:start position:0%
oh it's even worse if you're rural cuz
 
06:55:52.468 --> 06:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
then you don't have the fall back of a
 
06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
bus there's not that
 
06:55:57.310 --> 06:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
option and you might not have neighbors
 
06:55:59.150 --> 06:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
as close by that could maybe give you a
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
lift if you just you know walk down the
 
06:56:05.110 --> 06:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
street yeah any other
 
06:56:08.230 --> 06:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
questions pres of Hall thank you for
 
06:56:10.150 --> 06:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you envision when
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about the Hudson uh Windom
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
situation that a school district could
 
06:56:18.590 --> 06:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
budget could contract with teachers they
 
06:56:20.590 --> 06:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
they contracted their staff and all of a
 
06:56:22.270 --> 06:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
sudden you have these people leaving now
 
06:56:24.388 --> 06:56:24.398 align:start position:0%
they've got staff that they've hired
 
06:56:26.830 --> 06:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
that they contracted but they they don't
 
06:56:28.270 --> 06:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
need well that's say you might have way
 
06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
more staff than you need and you've got
 
06:56:34.590 --> 06:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
them for the year right um and then next
 
06:56:37.830 --> 06:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
door they might not have enough staff or
 
06:56:39.510 --> 06:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
if they're allowed to say well we're at
 
06:56:42.110 --> 06:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
capacity you how does that work when
 
06:56:44.190 --> 06:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
you're going month to month
 
06:56:47.628 --> 06:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
um and that would be very difficult and
 
06:56:49.190 --> 06:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
then again you don't know who's going to
 
06:56:51.150 --> 06:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
be in your classroom from month to month
 
06:56:53.708 --> 06:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
how do you meet the need learning needs
 
06:56:55.350 --> 06:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
of those students so all of those things
 
06:56:58.708 --> 06:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
are going through my head thank you yes
 
06:56:59.948 --> 06:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:57:04.190 --> 06:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:19.830 --> 06:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.628 --> 06:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
Scott thank you madam chair and members
 
06:57:24.310 --> 06:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the opportunity to
 
06:57:26.270 --> 06:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
testify here today my name is Sarah
 
06:57:27.830 --> 06:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
Scott and I'm with Americans for
 
06:57:30.030 --> 06:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire uh I
 
06:57:31.910 --> 06:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the points have already
 
06:57:33.350 --> 06:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
been covered so I'll try to keep this
 
06:57:35.430 --> 06:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
brief but uh I'm here today in support
 
06:57:37.868 --> 06:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
of this legislation uh and I think
 
06:57:42.270 --> 06:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
really this boils down to uh HB 741 is a
 
06:57:45.230 --> 06:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
simple and yet transformative idea that
 
06:57:46.910 --> 06:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
families have different needs and they
 
06:57:49.190 --> 06:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
know what's best for their family while
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
many families are uh finding success in
 
06:57:54.910 --> 06:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
their local public school there are
 
06:57:56.750 --> 06:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
other families that are experiencing
 
06:57:58.548 --> 06:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
certain needs that require them to look
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
outside of that District we've talked a
 
06:58:02.590 --> 06:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
lot about academics and I think the
 
06:58:04.270 --> 06:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
hearing in the Senate talked a lot about
 
06:58:06.590 --> 06:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
academics also but there are a number of
 
06:58:08.468 --> 06:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
situations that families might be facing
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
that would require them to look at
 
06:58:13.150 --> 06:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
programs like this um so for example
 
06:58:15.548 --> 06:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
Child Care is a huge issue in this state
 
06:58:17.590 --> 06:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
um it's something that a number of young
 
06:58:20.868 --> 06:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
families are facing here and allowing a
 
06:58:23.310 --> 06:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
student to go to another District may be
 
06:58:25.070 --> 06:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
their only solution for getting child
 
06:58:27.670 --> 06:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
care so a lot of families are relying on
 
06:58:30.750 --> 06:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
parents or uh family friends to go and
 
06:58:32.628 --> 06:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
watch their children after school
 
06:58:34.190 --> 06:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
if they're able to go and look at
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
another District where that family is
 
06:58:39.190 --> 06:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
this might be the only real solution for
 
06:58:41.708 --> 06:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
their family in terms of child care um
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
you have instances of families that the
 
06:58:47.070 --> 06:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
parents work outside of the district
 
06:58:49.670 --> 06:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
could be a teacher or somebody else that
 
06:58:52.510 --> 06:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
you know 25 minute drive to school might
 
06:58:54.350 --> 06:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
be the 25 minutes they get to spend with
 
06:58:56.150 --> 06:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
their child every morning that really
 
06:58:58.310 --> 06:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
leads to a lot of valuable family time
 
06:58:59.830 --> 06:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
that because of work schedules they just
 
06:59:02.350 --> 06:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't get any other way so um there
 
06:59:04.430 --> 06:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
could be a number of situations with
 
06:59:07.150 --> 06:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
family illness I know um my family for a
 
06:59:09.670 --> 06:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
long time took care of a grandmother
 
06:59:12.070 --> 06:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
that was not doing well and being able
 
06:59:14.788 --> 06:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
to look at other districts and find
 
06:59:16.388 --> 06:59:16.398 align:start position:0%
those opportunities there might be the
 
06:59:18.310 --> 06:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
way that families are finding a solution
 
06:59:20.670 --> 06:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
for aging family members so I think
 
06:59:22.230 --> 06:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
there are a number of situations in
 
06:59:24.030 --> 06:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
which this type of legislation would
 
06:59:26.868 --> 06:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
provide huge benefits to the family um
 
06:59:29.190 --> 06:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states that have
 
06:59:31.388 --> 06:59:31.398 align:start position:0%
passed similar bills already uh I
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
believe the number is over 20 I've seen
 
06:59:36.310 --> 06:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
conflicting reports over exactly how
 
06:59:39.030 --> 06:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
many but I believe it's 25 um have
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
policies like this and have addressed a
 
06:59:42.030 --> 06:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
number of the problems that have been
 
06:59:44.350 --> 06:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
brought up today um so I don't think
 
06:59:47.430 --> 06:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh an entirely new piece of
 
06:59:49.030 --> 06:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I think many states have
 
06:59:51.070 --> 06:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
figured out how to make this operate
 
06:59:53.948 --> 06:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
efficiently and uh overall I would just
 
06:59:55.310 --> 06:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
say I think this creates a great
 
06:59:57.430 --> 06:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a lot of families here
 
06:59:59.468 --> 06:59:59.478 align:start position:0%
and I hope you pass this legislation
 
07:00:02.990 --> 07:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you any questions
 
07:00:05.388 --> 07:00:05.398 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
 
07:00:07.430 --> 07:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
much and with that we'll close the
 
07:00:30.910 --> 07:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:30.920 --> 07:01:00.910 align:start position:0%
 
741

07:01:00.910 --> 07:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
