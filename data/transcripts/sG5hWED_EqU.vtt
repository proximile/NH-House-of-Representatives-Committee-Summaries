discovered one bill that somehow we
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
forgot to exec earlier we thought we had
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%

record that we had
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec eight bills on
 
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.150 align:start position:0%

now six of those bills will be retained
 
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.670 align:start position:0%
now six of those bills will be retained
so

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
we really don't need to have any
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
discussion of those six bills today
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
unless the committee absolutely wants to
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
and if you do then we will but there's
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
no real need to discuss those six bills
 
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.330 align:start position:0%
no real need to discuss those six bills
and

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
the only two bills that we really need
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
315

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
315
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
the first bill that we will
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
end it HB 106.
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
we will discuss try to discuss those two
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
bills this morning now at noon time
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
we have a hard break at noon time
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
because we have committee members that
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
have obligations between noon and one
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
and then at one o'clock we will
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
reconvene and the Department of
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services will give us a
 
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.870 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services will give us a
presentation

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
that probably will last anywhere from an
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
hour to possibly even as long as two
 
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
hour to possibly even as long as two
hours

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
and of course the week of that
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
presentation will depend on how many
 
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.969 align:start position:0%
presentation will depend on how many
questions

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:18.979 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
there are for the Des Representatives
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
who make the presentation
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
presentation is over if anyone feels
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
compelled to have further work safe work
 
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.020 align:start position:0%
session discussions
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
on any of the bills that we'll be
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
executing on Monday we can do that
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
if there is no
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
urgent requirement by the majority of
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
those in attendance to have further work
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
session discussions then we will end our
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
work for today and we'll see you all
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
back here on Monday
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
I assume we have a couple of questions
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
before we start so first the chair
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative oxenham for a
 
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative oxenham for a
question

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair for taking
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why you would suggest
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
that we not discuss the bills that are
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
listed on our agenda today it's our
 
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:19.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn what they're about
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
to discuss them to see where we have
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
commonalities to see where we might be
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
able to bridge disagreements uh I I
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
thought you know we're now facing
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps a month with no sessions the
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
Breakneck speed that we had to move
 
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
through our bills is off of the back of
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
our necks we can take our time and be
 
00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and do the work we were sent
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
here to do I would ask you to reconsider
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your question uh
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Samson just recognized
 
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:55.580 align:start position:0%
for a question yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a question it's um basically
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh just amplifies what uh represent
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
oxenham just said
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I was the one who added that a
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
while back had asked that we have work
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
sessions so we can discuss these bills
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
among ourselves so even if we are not
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
we're not going to end up acting on them
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
but retaining them I think there's a lot
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
of value to be gained with having
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
members be able to kind of exchange
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
ideas about why why they think this bill
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
or that bill is good or not good I think
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of learning experience
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that can be gained especially since we
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
have many new members so um
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think you can I don't
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
think you should restrict any kind of
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
discussion because it's going to be
 
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
discussion because it's going to be
retained

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
so that's just what I'd like to make a
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
comment about
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative it's not
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
my intention to restrict comment just
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
point out that when you retain a bill
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
what happens is you basically start the
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
process all over again
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
and uh since we will be doing that with
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
with these six bills we will have plenty
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
during the remainder of the
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
the year between now and July 1st and
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
then once again starting up in around
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
the end of August until around the first
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
of November there were possibly be the
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
first of December we have lengthy
 
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
discussions about each of these bills we
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
might even want to do a work session on
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
just one bill rather than
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
work session on five or six news so that
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
was my reasoning for doing this but if
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
we have a majority vote of the committee
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
to continue having discussions at the
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
work session today then we will do that
 
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
um my question is a little more
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental which is I was surprised to
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
hear that we're retaining a bunch of
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
bills without having discussed their
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
status so I'm just wondering where the
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
decision to retain all our work before
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
we've even had a chance to vote as a
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
committee on it has come from
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
basically that requirement came from
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
house leadership it turns out that we're
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
going to have a compressed schedule for
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
the rest of our session
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
the speaker has extended the deadline
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the house to deal with its bills
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
until the crossover date which is April
 
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.490 align:start position:0%
until the crossover date which is April
8th

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
8th
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
and it appears now that we're going to
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
have a three-day session in the first
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
week of April to deal with all the bills
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we have to deal with and there's
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
something like 360 of them
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
and so the speaker has asked us to
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
retain as many bills as possible
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
the workload that we're all going to
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
have to face in the first week of April
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have three concurrent
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
house sessions
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's not known yet whether it'll be
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday or Wednesday
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
Thursday Friday
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
but we'll have three consecutive days of
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
house sessions
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
presumably long days
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
but we'll have only those days to get
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
through our work
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
actually the rest of the house calendar
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
for this year
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
so that is the reason for the retain
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
request on all these bills and
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
because it was requested by leadership
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's what we will do
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
I just have one follow-up question if
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
there are bills that actually might
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for itl versus retained though
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
are maybe in the work session today we
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
could discuss
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
that potential because then it would be
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
also less work on the calendar for the
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
remainder of the year if the bill really
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have legs in terms of anything
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
that it's going to do to benefit New
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there might be some bills in
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
there that we don't want to retain just
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the fact that we might not want to
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question uh that's
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
a good point and if we can come to a 21
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
nothing consensus that a bill should be
 
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:28.820 align:start position:0%
you and I will go forward with that
 
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
you and I will go forward with that
communication

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
basically what the speaker wants to
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
avoid is lengthy debates uh we go to our
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
session the first week of April so any
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
bill that uh in my judgment could lead
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
to a lengthy debate I think we should
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
just put off because I don't think we're
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
going to be able to accommodate that in
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
our session in early April so last
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
weekend coming to a consensus that a
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
bill should be itl and all of us agree
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
just write representative oxenham you
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
have another question
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
yes I do and it pertains to HB 513 the
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
Broadband bill that is is now on our our
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
discussion list
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
it's a really simple thing which just
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
tries to get people together to try to
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
get a Meeting of Minds on an issue that
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
is at the top of everybody's constituent
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
list everybody is is saying we need
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
Broadband in New Hampshire if if we were
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
to have some action other than just
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
putting it on the Shelf I think we might
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
be able to get those leaders from the
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
community and the companies together to
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
start working on this because it it is a
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
matter of some urgency for our
 
00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:53.150 align:start position:0%

standard power green a good energy
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
Henry Herndon uh on behalf of the
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition you know what
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
also assisted uh but to get to it um the
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment I think is a um I I'm
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
hoping I'm looking at pretty much the
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
same document with the same line numbers
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
that that you may have
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
um it is a complete re replacement of
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
the bill so by looking at the amendment
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
you can really see the essentially the
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
whole build text
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
um section one of the bill at the first
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
page is the same as the bill is
 
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.610 align:start position:0%
page is the same as the bill is
introduced

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
um section two of the bill is also the
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
same as the bill as introduced there
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
were really no issues there
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
um section three the municipal and
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
County authorities
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
um preserves the original set of seven
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
authorities listed here does qualify
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
some of them uh in a manner that um you
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
know better uh protects perhaps the
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
interest of the distribution utilities
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
um it does qualified meter reading with
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
the phrase with commission approval for
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
meters under controlled by the electric
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities or used for load
 
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.649 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities or used for load
settlement

00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
um and on customer service it clarifies
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
that that is for aggregation provided
 
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.049 align:start position:0%
that that is for aggregation provided
Services

00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
um and not obviously Utility Services
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill on Municipal
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
aggregators authorized and and I I don't
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
know if um Matthew fossum attorney
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
fossums um has been able to speak as
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
well but but I would invite him with the
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
Chairman's permission to jump in on any
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
of these points and elaborate uh but
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill is as
 
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.490 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill is as
introduced

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
um it was an important clarification for
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
eversource uh they did not want the
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
language in this section to be
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
potentially used uh by Community
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
aggregations to argue that they had a
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
basis for being able to take over the
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
utility Consolidated billing functions
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
this this does allow
 
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
um aggregations to potentially
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
consolidate their aggregation bill with
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
other Municipal services such as Water
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
and Sewer Service uh but but not
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
um utility provided services so
 
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
um utility provided services so
um

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
that that was a very important issue for
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
for eversourcing the other utilities
 
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
for eversourcing the other utilities
um

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
I just received the email from the
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services the
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
amendment has been completed this number
 
00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
amendment has been completed this number
is

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
2021-0640h and I have just forwarded
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.850 align:start position:0%
the amendment
to

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:12.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
euclip and to the house
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
Ste committee to Jennifer Ford and to
 
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:22.580 align:start position:0%
Carrie Morris
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
Jennifer if you could produce copies and
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
bring them to
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
201 we'd appreciate that so everybody
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
else checked your legislative email and
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
you should find a copy of the amendment
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
as produced by so the one I'm reading
 
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:40.580 align:start position:0%
now is that the dentist
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
what you're reading now is a Word
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
document that we sent to OLS okay and
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
what you will receive what you will see
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
in your inbox is the actual Amendment as
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
produced by OLS I cannot
 
00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:57.539 align:start position:0%
I cannot say with certainty that the
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
words will be exactly the same because
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
OLS may have changed them but
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
um they should be pretty simple
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt Cliff go ahead
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
problem I do now have that and I'm
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
sending it along to eversource folks as
 
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.289 align:start position:0%
sending it along to eversource folks as
well

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and so far it does look like it
 
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.529 align:start position:0%
um and so far it does look like it
matches

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
matches
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and the in the page and line numbers
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
aren't that far off either so section
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
five of the bill that starts near the
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
top of the second page
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
um is some important cleanup it it
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
partially reflects the bill is
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
introduced there was some language
 
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.630 align:start position:0%
introduced there was some language
about

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
um aggregator aggregators that you know
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
defined her term in this statute
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
referring to Municipal County
 
00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
referring to Municipal County
aggregations

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
aggregations
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh it puts in some of the the language
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
that struck out here is language that's
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
original to the statute going back uh 25
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
years and it was before there was real
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
Clarity on what the role of these
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
entities would be vis-a-vis
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
um traditional Public Utilities so the
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
first sentence here that an aggregator
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
operating under under this chapter shall
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
not be considered a public utility under
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 colon 2. that's basically that
 
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.270 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 colon 2. that's basically that
is

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
identical to language that was
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
um subsequently put in the statute about
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers and Commercial
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
aggregators and Brokers uh It also says
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statute that they shall
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
not be considered public utility under
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
that RSA that that's the RSA that um
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
defines what our Public Utilities for
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
the purpose of sort of plenary oversight
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh you know overall regulation by the
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and um the
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
second part of that phrase was added a
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
couple years ago at the request of a
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
member of um Municipal and County
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
government and they shall not be
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
considered a municipal Municipal utility
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
under RSA 38 which is a statute that
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
authorizes a municipal
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
um utilities that would be owned both
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
electric distribution and uh and provide
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
power supply and we've got five or six
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
of those on a small scale level that
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
date back many uh into the early part of
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
the last century really
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
um but in any case
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
um it preserves the language that is in
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
the existing statute about giving
 
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.630 align:start position:0%
the existing statute about giving
aggregations

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
aggregations
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
an option purely an option to
 
00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:26.059 align:start position:0%
participate with ISO New England
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
wholesale energy Market as a load
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
serving entity for the purpose of
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
procuring and selling integer capacity
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
on behalf of their customers
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
um and and that that was something we
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
were concerned about
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the original bill would have struck
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
that language that keeps that option
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
open it's probably not one that many
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
will use
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
um early on uh but it but it may be an
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
option uh that a few of us want to
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
consider you know particularly perhaps
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
for opt-in
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
um options that that customers might
 
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.950 align:start position:0%
um options that that customers might
have

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.330 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
regulation of aggregators
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
um there is there was a section
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
um there was a rewrite of this whole
 
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.990 align:start position:0%
um there was a rewrite of this whole
whole

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
um 53 e colon 4 and the bill is
 
00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:13.909 align:start position:0%
um 53 e colon 4 and the bill is
introduced

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
um this language uh focuses this to
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
um one particular part of the statute so
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
the the other sections remain the same
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
um and this is the one concerning the
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
option of obtaining
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
um an aggregate aggregator possibly
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
upgrading uh the meters to provide
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
interval metering for load settlement
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
purposes or or other services
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
um it's an option that's available today
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
to large cni customers it's it's not
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
very available to small customers again
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
we we've the city of Lebanon and a few
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
others felt this was important uh to be
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
able to offer potential value-added
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
Services probably on a small Scale Pilot
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
basis initially but to
 
00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.269 align:start position:0%
basis initially but to
um

00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
a limited number of customers and so
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
this was a great concern to eversource
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
um and so some language that um they
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
suggested was added that that everybody
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
found agreeable and that is the language
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
on um line 17
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
of um the new PDF the official Amendment
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh which is also line 14 of the word
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
document uh seeing such metering shall
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
only be implemented subject to uh
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
commission commission finding it is in
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
the public good assuring that meter is
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
used for distribution tariff
 
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:33.980 align:start position:0%
implementation remain under the control
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
the majority ownership of the electric
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
distribution utility and otherwise
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
approving the terms and conditions for
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
such Arrangements including any data
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
sharing that might be appropriate
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
um that I paraphrased there
 
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.669 align:start position:0%
um that I paraphrased there
um

00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
would you like me to pause and see if
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
there's any questions as we go through
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
this of myself for you or Matthew
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
yes that would be useful and in fact
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
and is recognized thank you Mr chairman
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you Mr below for uh doing
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
all this work on this uh my question was
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
on we were just talking about uh the
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
metering uh looking at this it talks
 
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:18.860 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
aggregation could Supply its own Revenue
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
grade electric meter which would be in
 
00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:26.299 align:start position:0%
addition to the utility provided meter
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
is what do you envision happening if
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's two different readings there so
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
there's the someone decides that they're
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to have their own meter for the
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
purposes of electric energy but of
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
course the utility is going to keep one
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of charging for
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution charges so
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
let's say they don't read the same uh
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
that would be my first question what
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
happens then and second when you say its
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
own Revenue grade electric meter would
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
that media also be subject to the same
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
calibration and other requirements that
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
the that the utilities meter would you
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
know is like a couple of pages anyways
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
of requirements for Revenue grade meters
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
that the puc imposes on the utilities
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
yes I um I can't imagine a situation
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
where the POC or the utilities uh would
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
would approve this without the meters
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
meeting the same standards uh for
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue grade metering uh that are that
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
are well established uh standards
 
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.710 align:start position:0%
are well established uh standards
um

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
the I think the the difference would be
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean if there's already an
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
interval meter that can measure hourly
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
intervals uh which is sort of the key
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
unit of time
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
um uh for lead settlement purposes uh
 
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:41.059 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think the only situation with that
 
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:46.220 align:start position:0%
would occur is if for some reason
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
the utility kept their meter which was
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
not an interval meter that that was read
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
say monthly and you have a monthly read
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
versus uh the secondary meter which was
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
providing um hourly or more granular
 
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:00.889 align:start position:0%
providing um hourly or more granular
data

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
um so if there was a discrepancy you
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
know once you accounted for perhaps a
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
little deviation of the time stamp
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the monthly red ones
 
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.669 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the monthly red ones
don't

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they have a precise time
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
stamp or not interval meters have to
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a a time stamp
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that that would be a
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
cost for investigation and look at one
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
one or one of these two Revenue grade
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
meters is not um meeting the standard I
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
mean there there is a slight plus or
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
minus that's that's allowed for metering
 
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
minus that's that's allowed for metering
um

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
so you know a secondary Revenue degree
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
metering sort of a last resort although
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
I will say that these are being put in
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
now uh by demand response providers who
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
are participating in a particular ISO
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
New England program that requires
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
five-minute interval data with real-time
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
Telemetry to ISO New England so if they
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
call upon these resources to do a quick
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
response ISO New England can see that
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
they've actually responded because the
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
compensation is actually based on on
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in at the five minute
 
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.010 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in at the five minute
interval

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
interval
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
um and so that would be a type of
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
secondary Revenue grade metering that
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
that is already being installed pursuant
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
to ice on New England uh procedures and
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
if such a meter was installed we
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
actually have a proposal for that right
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%
now with the city with our Wastewater
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
and water treatment plants the social
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
media was installed uh then then perhaps
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
that meter uh would be an example of
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
such as secondary Revenue grade metering
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
that could could also be used for load
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
settlement as I understand it the
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
um all the load settlement goes through
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
them because essentially they have to
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
allocate their meter reading at the
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
wholesale interface between the
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
transmission grid and the distribution
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
grid they have to allocate that out on a
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
daily basis to all of the load-serving
 
00:32:54.899 --> 00:32:56.409 align:start position:0%
daily basis to all of the load-serving
entities

00:32:56.409 --> 00:32:56.419 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
for all the customers every retail meter
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
has to be within what's called a meter
 
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:04.340 align:start position:0%
domain of a load serving entity
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
that that then gets their share and if
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
there's actually hourly interval data
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
available on a daily basis and that's
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
what's used otherwise there's a very
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
complicated extrapolation
 
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:16.940 align:start position:0%
a secondary
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
secondary settlement that occurs months
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
later after after you've gotten the
 
00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:23.539 align:start position:0%
monthly meter reads
 
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up yeah so just to make it by
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
make it in the short term here uh what
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying is by the fact that it's a
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
revenue grade electric media you're the
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill would imply that that would have to
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
meet all the requirements of that
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
through calibration and so forth and as
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
far as the discrepancies that was my
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
exact point because the example
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
eversource doesn't have any uh interval
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
meters they're all just monthly red so I
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
guess if there was a difference between
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
the two then the commission would be the
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
arbitrator in those if someone wanted to
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
push the issue
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
um yes they would be the arbitrator
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
um I I would think the util the to the
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
priorities would want to maybe pull both
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
meters and have them tested to see which
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
one's wrong okay um one more follow-up
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead uh you we were talking
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
about the capacity I see you added that
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
in uh earlier in the amendment as well
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
so would you consider thou the let's
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
just say that the municipal aggregator
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
whatever their load is that would be
 
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
relieved from the utilities capacities
 
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.290 align:start position:0%
relieved from the utilities capacities
obligation

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
and it would be so they would you know
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
whatever megawatt hours that would have
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
been of the up to the whether the
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
utility would have been charged for
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
through the capacity Market they would
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
subtract those hours off that would no
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
longer be part of their obligation they
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
would just right into the power yes as I
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
um every
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
every meter every customer gets the
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
capacity tag which is their program
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
share of the capacity assigned to the
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
distribution utility as a whole
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so in the proposed rules everyone's
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
agreed that um the proposed rules would
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
make quite explicit that any aggregation
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
of whether
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
through their themselves as a load
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
serving Unity or on contract with
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier has to provide full
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
load following service
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
um which includes the capacity
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
obligation thank you
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
that representatively is recognized for
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
I want to sort of gut check what I'm
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
reading here it sounds to me like the
 
00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:48.619 align:start position:0%
language here is saying is basically
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
describing how the metering will work
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
when we're not uh simply using the
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
meters as for our ability for the
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
utilities to
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
um do the distribution tariff piece
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have other
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
generators assisting in the load and so
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
since it's undefined that's why we're
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
distinguishing the two but I I unlike uh
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I don't really
 
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
see an issue with us having increased
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
ability to have additional data from
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
meters since meters are more
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
sophisticated now if the utilities don't
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
possess that sophistication because
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
we've been working you and I have both
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
been working on the the Statewide energy
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
data platform and we understand that you
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
know meters are kind of key to to that
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
the insights that we want to have on our
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
system so I guess the question is just
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that all this is because when I look
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
at it I don't see it as exceedingly
 
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:52.940 align:start position:0%
complex I think all it's doing is
 
00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:56.540 align:start position:0%
distinguishing for us in in the statute
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
that the metering will be under the
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
commission's authority to determine
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's right and Justin
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and that uh competitive
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
suppliers will have the ability to
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
install meters that will allow them to
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide additional services in terms of
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
understanding what is happening
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh with usage and load
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
you remember
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I tried just a yes answer on
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
because because I can elaborate almost
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
anything here but but I'll try to stay
 
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
to the point
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
so if there's no other questions on this
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the next one is section seven of the
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
bill at line 23 or you know uh 20 in the
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
word version
 
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:03.530 align:start position:0%
word version
um

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
and this was important
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I think this is kind of what we
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
thought was intended all along but it
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't really spelled out so it's an
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
important clarification to protect
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
non-participants uh uh taxpayers
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
um ratepayers who are not participating
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the aggregation and it's simply it
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies that while um you know the
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
general statement that has been in the
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
law since um 1996
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
um actually uh now Senator Bradley
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
actually drafted this text originally
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
um says that the customers who are not
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh participating in the aggregation so
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
not be responsible for
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
and no entity shall require them to pay
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
any costs associated with such program
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
through taxes or otherwise except you
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
know electric power supply
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
or Services consumed directly by the
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
municipality or County and the the law
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
originally said or incidental cost
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
um you know except for except for energy
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
into incidental cost
 
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.170 align:start position:0%
into incidental cost
um

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
you know what there's a problem here
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
um uh representative the house this I
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't think this is quite what was
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
intended and I'm not quite sure how this
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
slip through
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
because it says the way it reads and and
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe I bear some responsibility
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
for this it reads that
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
you can't that they can't even be
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
incidental costs
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I think at line 27 where it says or
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
it should say except for incidental cost
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
which may include costs necessary to
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
comply with the provisions of this
 
00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
chapter up to the time that the
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
aggregation starts to produce revenue
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
from participating customers but shall
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
not include any capitalized or operating
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
cost of an aggregation
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um with the ore there the last phrase
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
could actually be read backwards
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
um the the type of incidental costs that
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
have been identified that that a
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
municipality may need to encourage that
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
there's requirements for public hearings
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
for instance before the municipal even
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
decides to have a plan and our our
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
community at least pays to have those
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
public hearing notices published in the
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
paper uh which would be a type of
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
incidental cost or another example that
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
we talked about was a community that
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
needs to have a legal review of a
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
proposed contract with a broker or
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
supplier uh before they've even started
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
the program that that could be an
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate incidental cost which would
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
be allowed to come from from a municipal
 
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
be allowed to come from from a municipal
budget

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but to get to the point the important
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
thing that was being added was at line
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 to make clear it shall not
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
include any capitalized or operating
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
cost of an aggregation program
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and those are those are Concepts that
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
are pretty clearly defined in the
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
government Accounting Standards Board
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
and and dra actually has some
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
requirements that unit disabilities
 
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:08.300 align:start position:0%
follow certain accounting standards and
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
so the point was to make it clear that
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
you couldn't you couldn't argue that
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
some costs that should probably be
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
capitalized or considering an operating
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
cost of an aggregation program you
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't argue that those are incidental
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
costs uh that might be allowable
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
um this is representative rosecliffe I
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
made a note about the
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
except for when you and I can talk about
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
that offline about
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have you verify for me in
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
your previous versions of the text that
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we intended and if we did
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to OS OLS and have that
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
any questions on that
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is recognized
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
for a question yeah thank you Mr
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is just a typo it looks
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
like on line 26 it says require them to
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
pay any cost Associated such program
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
looks like you're missing the word with
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
so that's another correction any cost
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
associated with such program
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's that would be correct I
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
think the word with is in the current
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
statute okay well
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't have to worry about it
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
well no but this is a rewrite of it so
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
it should be it should be correct okay
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
when we need to add it that should be
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
that should be picked up pretty easy
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
continue Cliff okay so section eight of
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
um is electric aggregation plan and uh
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
that that the only change to the current
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
section of this law here is
 
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.310 align:start position:0%
section of this law here is
um

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
that it explains that
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
um a county plan May provide an
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
aggregation program for all or subset of
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities within the county that
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
request to participate by majority vote
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
of their respective governing bodies now
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
this this is actually sort of a new
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
issue that was in the bill as introduced
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
or really brought up during
 
00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.430 align:start position:0%
or really brought up during
um hearings

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
um hearings
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
um but it it is sort of a a customer or
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
Community protection uh issue which is
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
um and it sort of arrives because
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
Chester County has been looking at this
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
and their their thinking was hey you
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
know if a community has already
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
considered this and rejected it we don't
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
want to be doing a county aggregation
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
plan that brings that municipality in if
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
they don't want to participate so this
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
sort of turns that around and allows a
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
county plan uh that could be for all
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
um or just a subset of their
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities but that would be subject
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
to the request of those municipalities
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
to participate by a majority vote of the
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
respective governing bodies you know
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
people could still individually opt out
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
and this the whole plan would still go
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the county legislative uh body uh for
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
approval uh but but this allows County
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
to not include municipalities that don't
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:13.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:13.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
hearing no questions on that I'll move
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
to number nine
 
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
to number nine
um

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
well I I should just pause there mention
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
that there were some other things in six
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
that the original bill was introduced
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
that would have um uh until that sorry
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
um that would have
 
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:36.849 align:start position:0%
um that would have
um

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated a couple things that
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
aggregation plans should look at
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
um you know how net metering would be
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
handled and how
 
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.849 align:start position:0%
handled and how
um

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:45.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
loan income
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
residential customers who are getting a
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
discount through the electric base
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
aggregation program would preserve that
 
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.690 align:start position:0%
aggregation program would preserve that
discount

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
discount
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
um so those are left in the statute uh
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
just because I I think people understood
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's important that aggregation plans
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
address that and and these were
 
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
um things that also the puc felt that
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that uh aggregation plans should should
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
go into people should go into it with
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
eyes wide open so to speak so that they
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
don't inadvertently uh cause somebody
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
some harm by putting them into an
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
aggregation program that doesn't sort of
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh meet their needs or keep their EAP
 
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.210 align:start position:0%
uh meet their needs or keep their EAP
discount

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
um moving to section 9 of the bill
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
um which starts at the bottom of page
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
two really continues at the top of Page
 
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.550 align:start position:0%
two really continues at the top of Page
Three

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
Three
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
um this is a whole rewrite of this
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
section so you're not going to see in
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
bold italics new text or strikeout of
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
old text it's complete replacement
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
so this this was
 
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:50.750 align:start position:0%
so this this was
[Music]

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.550 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
started on with the amendment that I
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
offered at the public hearing but
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
there's been considerable uh further
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
modification as a result of of these
 
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.930 align:start position:0%
modification as a result of of these
negotiations

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.089 align:start position:0%
negotiations
um

00:46:04.089 --> 00:46:04.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
and so let's see the the section once is
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same which which says
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
that um you know the government mean
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
body uh it says may submit the governing
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
body could decide that they don't want
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
to submit it so the the plan would die
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
at the governing body level level but
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
then uh they would that's if they want
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
to advance the plan uh they consider
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
submit it to the legislative body uh
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
typically town meeting except for towns
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
that have town councils and city
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
councils it's often the same body uh and
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
and County of course we all know what
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
the legislative body for the county is
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the rep state
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative delegation
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um they can submit it for final uh
 
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.470 align:start position:0%
um they can submit it for final uh
adoption

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
adoption
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
um or any revision that includes an
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
opt-out aggregation program it has to be
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
approved by a majority of those present
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
in voting that's the current law
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
um section two here of this RSA starting
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
at line five
 
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
at line five
um

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
um
does

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
does
um

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is a whole new section it is
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat modeled or sort of the takeoff
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
point was something that was in the
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
original build
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
um it requires any plan or any revision
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
of a plan that's going to include an
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
opt-out default service program to be
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
submitted to the commission the puc
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
either before or after being submitted
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the um by the governing body to the
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
legislative body for approval
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
huh that was adoption at one point but
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
got went back to approval oh well
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
um to determine whether the plan
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
conforms to the requirements of this
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
chapter and applicable rules of the
 
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
chapter and applicable rules of the
commission

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.410 align:start position:0%
commission
uh

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh commission uh shall approve any plan
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
submitted to it unless it finds it
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the requirements of the
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
chapter or other applicable rules uh
 
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
cause for them to detail in writing
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
um those those uh problems to the
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
governing body of the municipality are
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
kind of concerned
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and it does have a provision that
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
failure to disapprove a plan submitted
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh within 60 days shall constitute
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
approval thereof that's similar to what
 
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.829 align:start position:0%
approval thereof that's similar to what
happens

00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
um in in other uh situations in the
 
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.790 align:start position:0%
um in in other uh situations in the
statute

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.290 align:start position:0%
statute
um

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
in Municipal your county can submit a
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
revised plan it sort of restarts the
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
clock on on this review process
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
um it is also required to be submitted
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
at this on the same date to the office
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocate and any
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility providing
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
service within the jurisdiction of the
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
municipality County
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then the consumer Advocate the
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
utilities and members of the public can
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
file comments uh within the first 20
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
days 21 days of the submission
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and then the commission review and
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
approval uh it doesn't require contested
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
case doesn't have to be an adjudicated
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding but it has to allow time for
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
the for the submission of those comments
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
and the consideration of com such
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
comments by the commission
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
so that was a mouthful um but I think
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed that this is a prudent
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and it's similar to what the Attorney
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
General does though with a 30-day time
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
period and no public comment on a
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
proposed joint action agreements between
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties or other
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and agencies that
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative Pimentel you're
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
recognized uh thank you Mr chairman just
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh if we're doing typos
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
line 12
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.069 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
this is Matt it says Matt instead of
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
meat right there's truth on that and
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
there's two these okay
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
I got that
 
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
I got that
representative

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
I guess that was the only question okay
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
let's continue
 
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
let's continue
okay

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
Ramen three is is sort of uh built off
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
of what's in the current statute
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
although I think there's there's some
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
significant uh changes
 
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
significant uh changes
um

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
let me see
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
um maybe not this this is pretty much
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
what's in the current statute if if
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
you've got an act out up service
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
if any plan any plan whether it's opt-in
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
or opt out uh or if you were adopted an
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
opt-in plane and it's revised to include
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
an opt-out service then you then
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
municipality kind of has to mail writ
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
notification to all retail customers
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
within the municipal County
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
oh this this is um
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
a part of what's what's new
 
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:56.780 align:start position:0%
um to enable such male notification
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this RSA about about
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.430 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this RSA about about
customer

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.089 align:start position:0%
customer
um

00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh data after an aggregation plan is
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
duly approved
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
um the distribution utilities or
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
utilities are going to provide to the
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
municipality County current list of the
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
names and mailing addresses of all
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
electric customers uh so they can do the
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
required mailing and for customers that
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
are in utility provided default service
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
the account numbers and any other
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
information necessary for successful
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the aggregation
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statute I think a
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
provision that's not amended uh
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties are subject
 
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:38.900 align:start position:0%
to this RSA 363
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
38 which requires them to keep any
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
confidential but
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
um the way these this program works in
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they do provide to the
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
municipal aggregation or this or the
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
supplier that's working with them uh
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
this kind of data because it's the
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
burden is on the supplier to do the
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
enrollments and they have to have the
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
account number and sometimes there's
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
something else a
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
a name code which is not necessarily the
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
same as the mailing address name
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
that that has to be that's needed for
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
successful enrollment and actually some
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
of this text was suggested by by
 
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.809 align:start position:0%
of this text was suggested by by
eversource

00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:24.829 align:start position:0%
eversource
um

00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
so that was helpful
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
um the next sentence at line 30 is an
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
existing statute pretty much you have to
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
describe the program rights and
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and if and if it's on
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
an opt-out basis the fixed rate or
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
charges that apply uh so
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
um again this is a customer protection
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
provision that's in the existing statute
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
that no retail customer uh shall be
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
included in a program in which the
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
customer does not know all the rates or
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
charges the customer may be subject to
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
at least 30 days in advance of that
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
application and has the option for a
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
period of not less than 30 days from the
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
date of the mailing to opt out of being
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
unless they affirmatively respond to the
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
notification request and writing to be
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
included in the program
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean there could be a different
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
kind of program that somebody opts into
 
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.750 align:start position:0%
kind of program that somebody opts into
uh

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
um but but um otherwise people have to
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
know what you know the rate that they're
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to be charged and have time to opt
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you recognized
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr below I'm
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
looking at that last section the
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
starting with the no retail Electric
 
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:45.380 align:start position:0%
customer on line 32 going to 33.
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
and goes on to talk about that the
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
customer does not know all the rates or
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
the co or the charges the customer may
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
pay sub it to at least 30 days in
 
00:53:55.329 --> 00:53:55.339 align:start position:0%
advance of the customer's application
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
what's the customer's application we're
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking about this is the end user the
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
the person consuming the electricity
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
I noticed that in in one of my read
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
throughs and and I'm the intent there
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
the meaning that's intended there is
 
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
the meaning that's intended there is
that

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
um in advance of the application of the
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
rate to the customer
 
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.270 align:start position:0%
rate to the customer
um

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
and somewhere along the way it got
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
turned turned around I think this is
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
maybe in the current law or maybe
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
somehow along the way some words got
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
dropped so so this might be something
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
that could be clarified the intent is
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
that for for
 
00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:43.630 align:start position:0%
that for for
um

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
that they do not know all the rates or
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
charges the customer may be subject to
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
at least 30 days in advance of
 
00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:51.470 align:start position:0%
at least 30 days in advance of
um

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
the application of those charges to the
 
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.490 align:start position:0%
the application of those charges to the
customer

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
um follow-up Mr chairman
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead yeah that's what I assumed
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to mean not the
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
customer's application but the
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
application of the rate to the customer
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe that's something that's going
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
to be changed because this assumes that
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
the if you read this you assume the
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
customer's making in some kind of
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
application and it's really we're
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
talking about applying the the new rate
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
to the customer
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
right so that's an ongoing obligation of
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
the aggregation and well
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that the customer always knows you
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to be charged so
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
they can always get out of the program
 
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.329 align:start position:0%
they can always get out of the program
um

00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
so yes I let's um make a note that that
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
should be turned around
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
I made it that's what these work
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
sessions are helpful for having lots of
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
eyes on this that even though a lot of
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
eyes have been on it we still sometimes
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
miss these things
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
after all you have to remember this was
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
a an amendment crafted by a
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee that was some as many as 28
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
people so it can get unruly at times
 
00:55:59.370 --> 00:55:59.380 align:start position:0%
opposed to the kennel
 
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.710 align:start position:0%
opposed to the kennel
[Music]

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay I had to moving on to the top of
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
uh uh the public meeting to answer
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions is has been in the statute all
 
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.069 align:start position:0%
questions is has been in the statute all
along

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.569 align:start position:0%
along
um

00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
Roman five again this sort of reiterates
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
this ah here here's here's a way and and
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
maybe this is where this sort of hybrid
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
um service is proposed to be offered by
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
or through an aggregation shall be an on
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
an opt-in basis unless the program
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
explicitly recates an opt-out
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
alternative default Energy Service where
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Raider price is known at least 30
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
days in advance of its application
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
um and for a period of not less than 30
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
days from the date of notification the
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
customer has an opportunity to opt out
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
of being enrolled in such a program by
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
return postcard website or such other
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
additional means as may be provided
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think this this was in
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
um still is uh and and I think the
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
implication is there you got to provide
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
a return postcard and a website at least
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
there are some changes here that um were
 
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.609 align:start position:0%
there are some changes here that um were
partially

00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
partially
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure it was in the bill is
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
introduced but it was in a previous uh
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment by by eversource uh
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
it clearly puts the obligation on the
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
aggregator to provide
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
um uh the enrollment
 
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.890 align:start position:0%
um uh the enrollment
um

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
it also provides that
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
um customers opting out will instead
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
remain on the utility provided default
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
service and if you're taking service
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
from a competitive supplier you're
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're not to be enrolled in the
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
aggregation program unless that customer
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily opts in
 
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.670 align:start position:0%
voluntarily opts in
um

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
Romans 6 is to solve a problem that we
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
all agreed was a problem and when we
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
started talking about uh rules and the
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
informal stakeholder process of the puc
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
which is how to deal with new customers
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
after the initial
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
mailing has been done and
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh this this I think everybody felt
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
finally works correctly and consistently
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
with how it's done in Massachusetts so
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
ever source and Unitil that do this in
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts don't have to change their
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
systems or or software to accommodate
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
this which is to say that um upon
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
request of an aggregator not but not
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
more than monthly uh the utilities
 
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:38.420 align:start position:0%
they'll make available to each operating
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aviation or County aggregation
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
where there's no Municipal aggregation
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
the names account numbers mailing
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
address and other information necessary
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
for successful enrollment in the
 
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:51.020 align:start position:0%
aggregation of customers that are new to
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
or then currently on electric
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
distribution utility provided default
 
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.210 align:start position:0%
distribution utility provided default
service

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
um after they provided that initial list
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
and they're located within the service
 
00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:02.270 align:start position:0%
and they're located within the service
area

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
um the aggregation so periodically mail
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
a written notification to such new
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
customers that have not previously opted
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
out of the aggregator service and shall
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
enroll them in the aggregation
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
consistent with the opt-in or opt-out
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
requirements that were previously
 
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.609 align:start position:0%
requirements that were previously
expressed

00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
um and the the subtlety here just so you
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
understand in Massachusetts they don't
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually provide a custom list of new
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
customers they said it's actually just
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
easier to provide all the customers that
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
are then say you know six months later
 
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:31.700 align:start position:0%
that are then on
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
utility provided default service and the
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
burdens on the aggregator to tease out
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
those that had previously opted out so
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
they're not bothered with the second
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
opt-out notice so they're only mailing
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
to new customers and those new customers
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh the Romans 7 at line 26 is is the is
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
the same as current law uh Roman 8
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
um does have some additional customer
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
protection Provisions that were
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
particularly suggested by Mark Brown uh
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
that that you know he found were
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
satisfactory the first sentence is one
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's an existing statute
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
um about customers uh who are enrolled
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
in a municipality a municipal County
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
provided default service meaning the
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
opt-out uh sort of basic service shall
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
be free to elect a transfer to utility
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
provided default service or to a
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier with adequate
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
notice in advance in the next meter
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
regular meter reading
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
um in the same manner as if they were
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
unusually provided default service or as
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission that's that's
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
in current law the new thing is that no
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
such customers should be required to pay
 
01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:49.460 align:start position:0%
an exit fee or charge for such transfer
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
you know and I I kind of thought the
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
previous sentence said that but this
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
makes it very explicit no exit fee you
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
you there's no cost if you want to go
 
01:00:58.799 --> 01:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
you there's no cost if you want to go
back

01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
on a regular meter reading cycle there
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
is additional sentence here that says
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
customers requesting transfer of Supply
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
service on a date other than the next
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
regular meter read
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
may be charged an ice off cycle meter
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
reading and billing charge these are
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
things that are in the distribution
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
utility tariffs because um if you don't
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
um interval metering with with
 
01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:23.450 align:start position:0%
um interval metering with with
communication

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
um which actually the co-op and Unitil
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
do but but but the eversource and
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
Liberty don't you know they have to send
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
somebody out to do the special meter
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
read and then do a special billing and
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
they have a charge for that in their
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
tariffs so that could be passed on to
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
if they say you know I want to be trans
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
my next meter reads in three weeks I
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
want to be transferred um you know
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
tomorrow then then there could be a
 
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.210 align:start position:0%
tomorrow then then there could be a
charge

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a couple of questions yeah
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
that represents it's your record
 
01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:58.460 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh and don't forget to stop I'm not sure
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
all right can you hear me yes we can
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
the question I had uh I have several but
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I have is customer
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
moves into a new neighborhood
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
somebody you know they tell them you
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
have to connect the utilities etc etc
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
and they know they have to do that does
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
anybody give them that they're uh tell
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
them that there are options in the
 
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
them that there are options in the
community

01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I mean we discussed that yeah that
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
was sort of in the original
 
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.609 align:start position:0%
was sort of in the original
um

01:02:33.609 --> 01:02:33.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
but but the the utilities didn't want to
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
have to have that responsibility
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so they just automatically go into
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
the utility provided default service
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
um until uh the uh six months gets gets
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
the um information and can uh do a
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
mailing to the to the new customers and
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
um then they would have the choice uh to
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
um opt out and stay on the utility
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
provided default service but the
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
aggregator for six months wouldn't have
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
that information is that correct well
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
they they can request it up to once a
 
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.390 align:start position:0%
they they can request it up to once a
month

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
um they can which is sort of one thing
 
01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
but the utilities yeah
 
01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:17.339 align:start position:0%
they do it one they do it once a month
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
you don't you know it's like too much of
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
a bother to do it more frequently than
 
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.410 align:start position:0%
a bother to do it more frequently than
that

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
um for for both sides
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify that because
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think that customers should have the
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
options municipality should know who's
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
moving into their municipality that
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
should be very easy for them to get
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
counties a little bit more difficult but
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
through registrations of Deeds they
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
should know that uh and I wondered if it
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
was going to be six months but it
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be okay that's all I needed to
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
know like you're on video now I don't
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
think you need to use your phone
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
uh lee yeah I'm a grown woman my my
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative samsich is
 
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman uh Mr below I
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
just a question uh how how is um in the
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
case that uh representative Kelly Pitts
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
just mentioned where somebody moves into
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
a new home uh let's say it's somebody in
 
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
Lebanon that moves from one address to
 
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.020 align:start position:0%
another address even though they were
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
previously uh customers of the same
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
utility does that show up as a new
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
customer or is that just a address
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
change of a previous customer how does
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
how would that be handled
 
01:04:41.339 --> 01:04:42.710 align:start position:0%
how would that be handled
um

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the previous section
 
01:04:53.049 --> 01:04:53.059 align:start position:0%
um at lines uh sort of 14 15 16
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
if they relocate
 
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
if they relocate
um

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
within the same utility service area and
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're continuing service with a
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
um or if you move within the same town
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
and you're in a municipal aggregation
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you're on the municipal aggregation
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
um or the same county same thing uh then
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
then you stay on that service so if I
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
just move across town I'm on the
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
municipal aggregation then I would just
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
stay on the municipal aggregation if if
 
01:05:28.849 --> 01:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
I move in from another town and I'm on
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply and that suppliers
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
also serves in the same jurisdiction
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
you'd stay on that and that's the case
 
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.069 align:start position:0%
you'd stay on that and that's the case
today

01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
um but if you're new to the town and you
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
aren't weren't on the aggregation
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
program uh then then that's where you'd
 
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.910 align:start position:0%
program uh then then that's where you'd
be

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
um sort of automatically you put on the
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
utility provided default service because
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
because that's the only way their
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
systems are set up
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and and so they they basically
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
indicated this this would be a major
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
problem if they were to try to change it
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
to confirm with the existing law so
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
that's why this law change is important
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
so so you
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
you know the aggregation still has an
 
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
option to pick up those customers on an
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
opt-out basis
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:13.250 align:start position:0%
um but
um

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
um you know it's more the burdens on the
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
aggregation to process the customer so
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
the utility uh so you know we're not
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
creating new costs for the utility that
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
they don't have today okay thank you
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
thanks Cliff I just want to remind you
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
it's 1106 and we have a hard stop at 12
 
01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:34.970 align:start position:0%
it's 1106 and we have a hard stop at 12
o'clock

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.089 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the the final thing at the bottom of
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
page four was just that if a customer
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
um requests the aggregator that they
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
want to go back to utility provided
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
default service the aggregator shall do
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
that uh so again the burden's not on the
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
utility to do that the utilities
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes do that because the customer
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
may just come to them uh but but they
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
would prefer that the aggregator take
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
that responsibility for executing it's
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
often called A Drop That A supplier or
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
aggregator drops the customer and then
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
they automatically go back to you to
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
leave providing default service
 
01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
leave providing default service
um

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
um you know at the top of page five this
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
Roman nine
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
um just says if you
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
originally had an opt-in program and you
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
want to do an opt out then you have to
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
go back through the process previously
 
01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.450 align:start position:0%
go back through the process previously
described

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.230 align:start position:0%
described
um

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
the section uh 10 at line five uh this
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
starts off the way it was an existing
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
statute but the new language uh really
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
starts at the end of line six and um or
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
really line six all together uh that's
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
to the extent authorities granted didn't
 
01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
spies and counties by this chapter
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
materially affect the interest of the
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities and their
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
customers the reasonably balance such
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
interest with those of the
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties for the
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
public good uh which may also be done
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
through adjudicative proceedings to the
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
extent specified or not addressed in
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
rules so that's sort of a mouthful but
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
the concept you know the concept of
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
public good is one that's really well
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
established in case law for the Public
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission it has to do with
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
balancing interest
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
um the current sort of laws that the POC
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
is an Arbiter of the you know they
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
balance the interest of the utility and
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
their rate payers this is sort of adding
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
a third party to the picture which could
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
impact the utility itself off so this
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that the commission you
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
know can address this the rules and the
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
the rules the draft proposed rules you
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
know specify certain things that would
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
get kicked out to an adjudicative
 
01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.570 align:start position:0%
get kicked out to an adjudicative
proceeding

01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
um are there might be things that come
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
up that that nobody thought of to
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
address in the rules that that would
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
allow the commission to take that up
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicated proceeding where
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
they could settle the issue so it just
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
it just provides
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
um sort of additional uh assurance that
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
the commission has oversight in any way
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
in which these aggregation might uh
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
particularly adversely impact the
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
um The rulemaking Authority was expanded
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
by you know everybody thought it was
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
better to make express some of the
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
things that the rules should include but
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
not limited to including metering
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
billing access to customer data for
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
planning or operation
 
01:09:21.179 --> 01:09:22.010 align:start position:0%
planning or operation
um

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
and the other language was stuff that
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
was in the current statute
 
01:09:26.699 --> 01:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
was in the current statute
um

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
moving to section 10 which is the final
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
section of the bill if there's no
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions on this previous one
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
um this was something that was uh in the
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced but in in very
 
01:09:41.699 --> 01:09:42.410 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced but in in very
um

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
very short form and expanded upon in you
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
know the previous suggested
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
um amendments uh but but after a lot of
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
this this one took a lot of talking to
 
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
work through and get everybody on board
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
but basically it provides that um
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
there'll be a purchase of receivables
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
program and that at minimum it would
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
um aggregations either those that are
 
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
serving as blood-serving entities or a
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
competitive electricity supplier serving
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it can include other competitive
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
suppliers generally uh and to the extent
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
and for such rate classes as the
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
commission finds after notice and
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
hearing that it's for the public good so
 
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
it's it's somewhat uh puns the question
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
of the if this is available to everyone
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
or not a little bit down the road
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um different utilities have different
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
point of view on this and that's why the
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
final sentence is here uh such a
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
determination shall be on a utility
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
specific basis if proposed and ascended
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
to by the utility and what we know is
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
that eversource for instance because
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
they do this for all suppliers in
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut uh their
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
preference is to do this for all
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
suppliers that use Consolidated billing
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about which you'll
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
see in the next section
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
um that they would like to provide this
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
to all
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I know that Liberty I'm not
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
sure exactly where the co-op is but
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
Liberty uh doesn't want to do that
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
um they want to just provide por for
 
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.390 align:start position:0%
um they want to just provide por for
um

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County aggregations so
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
what's por
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
um this final paragraph uh Roman 2 sort
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
of describes the parameters of it
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
um it leaves it to the distribution
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
utility or requires the distribution you
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
tell you to propose to the commission
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
for re View and approval APR program in
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
which detail pays in a timely manner the
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
amounts due to the supplier from their
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
customers for electricity Supply less a
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
discount percentage rate equal to the
 
01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:50.060 align:start position:0%
utilities actual uncollectible rate
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted to recover capitalized and
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
operating costs specific to the
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
implementation operation of the purchase
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
of receivables program including working
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
capital again a mouthful but what that
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
means is that there is a cost to setting
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
up capitalize costs software computer
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
software changes
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
the billing software changes uh maybe
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
business process and there's ongoing
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
operating costs to do this uh to
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
implement and operate the POR including
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
a working capital which which is you
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
know the utilities and the Utility
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
Commission you know it's well
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
established how they figure out you know
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
a compensation for lead and lags on you
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
know payments and working capital uh
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's all um as you'll see in the next
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
sentence or two that's all
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
um going to be put on the POR program
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
and not existing rate payers
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
um so it goes on additionally such
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
discount rate adjustments show include a
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
prior to share the cost of ministering
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
collection efforts such that the
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
utilities participation in the POR shall
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
not require the utility or
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
non-participating consumers to assume
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
any costs arising from its use so you
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
know if if a customer goes under you
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
know walks away they've left a thousand
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollars due that's bad debt you can't
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
collect it because they've moved out of
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.530 align:start position:0%
collect it because they've moved out of
state

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
um and it's not worth the bother or you
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
might try to collect it
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
um on behalf and that's that's shared
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
between the aggregation the distribution
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
and transmission charges uh then you're
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to prorate the cost of trying to
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
collect that to
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
um uh the the the different uh programs
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
um but you're going to allocate
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
um well this is actually the next couple
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
sentences you're going to allocate the
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
cost attributable to this program uh to
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
the program including the write-offs
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
from the portion of the supply so just
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
to wrap it up such Paretta shares the
 
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:48.260 align:start position:0%
cost must include but not be limited to
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
any increases in the utilities bad debt
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
write-off attributable to participants
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the plr program as approved by the
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissions so the commission has some
 
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.890 align:start position:0%
commissions so the commission has some
oversight

01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
um the allocation of costs arising from
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
different rate components and
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
determination of the uncollectible rate
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
shall be Equity allocated between such
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
suppliers utility provided default
 
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
service and other utility charges that
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
are part of Consolidated billing
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
um as approved by the commission and the
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
final provision is the discount
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
percentage rate she'll be subject to
 
01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
periodic adjustment as approved by the
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
commission which is how they do it in
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
other states so if if that rate is under
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
collecting or over collecting it can be
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
periodically adjusted so it so it's
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
essentially reconciled to actual cost
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
so that was a fast explanation of of por
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
but um I think everybody uh went away
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
feeling like this this is the kind of
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
language that creates the parameter so
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's not cost shifting uh either for
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
the cost of the program or the bad debt
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
that might arise from A supplier uh uh
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
charges to customers that don't don't
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
pay their bill uh but but
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
um a lot of suppliers feel that this is
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
a very important thing for them to enter
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
the market uh because they're not in it
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for them to chase
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
individual residential customers for
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
just part of the bill
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll stop there thank you if
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
that was a fantastic
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
explanation of what amounted to what six
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
or seven or maybe even eight hours of
 
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
negotiation discussion uh you did a
 
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:22.340 align:start position:0%
terrific job in 45 minutes
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
explaining the contents of the amendment
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
I see that representative Thomas has a
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
question and is recognized oh uh
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually it wasn't intending to put my
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
hand up on what's it exactly but I was
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to say just like these chair I was
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
very impressed with this situation line
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
by line something I've been wanting to
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
half of the entire committee
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative samsich is recognized for
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr below for the for great at uh
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
presentation that we we tried hard to
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
understand uh on the last page there I
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
think there's a typo here that probably
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
needs correcting as well on the last
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
section under billing Arrangements
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the first first section
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says such a determination
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
May shall be
 
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
right and representative I was I think I
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
think that was because the May was
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
crossed out uh in in track changes and
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
replaced with shell at Liberty's
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
um request so I think shell
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
um was was kind of what was
 
01:16:46.679 --> 01:16:47.390 align:start position:0%
um was was kind of what was
um

01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
consented to assented to at the end of
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
Ary

01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
I see one way over in the corner the
 
01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:15.500 align:start position:0%
diploger is recognized for a question
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:20.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
objectives about using their capacity
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
our capacity and Supply they had some
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
plans I was aware of this allow them to
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
continue with the plants and Community
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
energy Traditions yes
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
yep with this amendment
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
um we we don't see any problems or
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
barriers to uh doing some of the things
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
we're starting to plan plan for which
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
which we hope will prove to be value
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
added services to our um rate payers
 
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:21.410 align:start position:0%
added services to our um rate payers
and

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
is what others thank you for that point
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:30.140 align:start position:0%
okay are there
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
comments uh anybody on the committee any
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions it is a long and complex
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
been

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
in attendance with all six seven eight
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
hours I don't remember exactly how many
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
hours that we spent on this
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
having watched and listened to every
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
single minute of that discussion I'm
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
confident that this amendment does what
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
everybody wants it to do and
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
once we get the typos fixed I think this
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment that we can all be
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
very happy with uh representative
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
Harrington is recognized yeah thank you
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just want to say first I
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank everybody for all the hard
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
work and it's a way of background you
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
know uh the chairman and I put this bill
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
in it was sort of a placeholder at the
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
last minute because we knew something
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
had to be changed but we didn't
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
necessarily endorse what was put in but
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
we needed something out there so the
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill was put into play and there's been
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
a lot awful lot of hard work on this by
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of people and
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I had some real serious concerns on
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
some of the issues and I think they've
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
been addressed and uh I'll be supporting
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment and again thanks for all
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
the hard work that was done by so many
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
individuals on this I think it's
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
something we can do for the people and
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
let the uh you know the aggregators and
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh have their goal and if
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work for them well they can
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
always come back but let's give them the
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsich is
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment yes thank you
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I too want to extend my
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
appreciation to the chairman also to
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
state representative Kelly Pitts who was
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
working many hours on this as well and
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
to Mr Bilo obviously so I think it was a
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
great great effort and I really uh
 
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay if anybody
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
if anybody
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
that's about my point rate I wouldn't
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
know who to go to for uh a city to an
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
application but Jackie if you know the
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
proper authorities to go for it
 
01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
he's out there in Iraq right now
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:59.330 align:start position:0%
he's out there in Iraq right now
[Laughter]

01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay any further uh representative McGee
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
is uh recognized for a comment
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah no it was just a
 
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah no it was just a
clarification

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
ended today those will go back to OLS
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
when will we have a clean Amendment
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
well I will try to get them to uh OLS
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
during our lunch break from 12 to 1.
 
01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:25.850 align:start position:0%
during our lunch break from 12 to 1.
um

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'll succeed and I don't
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
know if they'll be able to turn anything
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
around today but I'll get them in as
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible and they'll turn it
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
around as quickly as as soon as they can
 
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.890 align:start position:0%
around as quickly as as soon as they can
okay

01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have them for Monday so
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
we can know what we're voting on because
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
we definitely have to have them for
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
Monday because we can't adopt an
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
amendment with us right the correct
 
01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment so yes we'll definitely have
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
it by Monday
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
seeing that I guess we can uh
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
move on with this issue to bed and once
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
again I offer my thanks to everybody for
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I would like to next if it's okay
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the committee to
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
discuss uh house bill 106.
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
I had sent around on Wednesday a
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment
 
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:27.980 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a perfect Amendment it may
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
require some additional adjustments but
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
to start a conversation about whether or
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
not we could find enough consensus on
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
this bill to move it forward this year
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
if we cannot then we will retain it but
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
um thought that this might be a starting
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
point for a discussion and so I'd like
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
to hear if uh what kinds of thoughts
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
people have about the amendment it's
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
and uh I can go through it I I did in
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
the email that I sent when I sent it out
 
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:19.340 align:start position:0%
I indicated what the major changes were
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
I can go through that again if you would
 
01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:58.149 align:start position:0%
I can go through that again if you would
like

01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay I found the original email
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
so the amendment makes the following
 
01:24:04.679 --> 01:24:08.270 align:start position:0%
so the amendment makes the following
changes

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
before I go through these maybe I should
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
recognize some folks who have their
 
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:13.940 align:start position:0%
hands up
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives Pimentel if it's
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question or a comment
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
I I'm just wondering about the reasoning
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
behind the geographic limitation on the
 
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill uh line 19.
 
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:34.940 align:start position:0%
on page one you could explain
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I have with a new
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
permission to speak and since this was
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
part of your original bill
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I had my microphone off
 
01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative Lang did you hear the
 
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
question by Representatives Pimentel and
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
can you give him an answer since this
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
it's possible that representative Lang
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
has stepped away from his computer
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to that question when
 
01:25:54.189 --> 01:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you recognize for a
 
01:25:57.239 --> 01:26:02.330 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you recognize for a
question

01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.770 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
um limit the megawatts from so it's
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
basically covering now from between one
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
megawatt and two megawatts because I
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
think that exclusion will affect a
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
number of the municipalities who have in
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
excess of two megawatts and we're hoping
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
that we would be raising the net meter
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
and cap to the perk limit to you know
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
below five so and that was what was in
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
the original bill I was a co-sponsor on
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
this particular version
 
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:32.990 align:start position:0%
this particular version
um

01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
the net metering bill that came from
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
last session that we were trying to
 
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:41.540 align:start position:0%
accomplish for municipalities
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
help them basically lower their costs
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm that uh limitation I
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know where it came from I guess
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's my question but I think that that
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
limitation will very much weaken the
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of the relief that it will
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
provide for those folks who are hoping
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
think of that question the the
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
limitation in the
 
01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:08.900 align:start position:0%
16 of two Meg Watts came from discussion
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
with members of
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
the majority caucus
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lang testified in his
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
introduction as well he saw it as a
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.090 align:start position:0%
pilot program
yeah

01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:24.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
Limited in nature make sure your
 
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
Limited in nature make sure your
um

01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
your microphone is muted
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's where that two
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
megawites megawatts came from
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lang if you are there
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.139 --> 01:28:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that in in the majority
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
caucus the I the concept came up of a
 
01:28:15.179 --> 01:28:16.850 align:start position:0%
caucus the I the concept came up of a
pilot

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I think this particular legislation
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
for municipal net metering is in its
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
fourth year at least of trying to come
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
into being and the pilot maker would be
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we have pending municipalities
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
who've already made the Investments that
 
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
are looking to hold the costs by being
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
eligible which means that not
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to jump on this uh so
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
I I would push back to say that the idea
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
of a pilot is one idea but it's not
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually it doesn't really relate to
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
this bill because this bill is in
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
response to the fact that municipalities
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
have existing and you know pending
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
projects and existing projects that
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
would benefit from this if the cap were
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
higher than the two megawatts if it was
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
up to five so again I'm just advocating
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
for that because it didn't have this
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
exclusion before this go around
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and it was it was never intended to
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
be this low
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
so uh if it's a pilot it's a pilot
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
and if it's a municipal net metering
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
bill it's a municipal net metering bill
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
but I don't see how this
 
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
um limitation was just pulled out of
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
thin air and put into the bill because
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like it has any
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
relationship to the problem we're trying
 
01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
to solve with the bill
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative McWilliams
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
I I also have some concerns about this
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
reduction from the up to five megawatts
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
now we're going down to two megawatts
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we have quite a
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
few existing Hydro facilities
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
um that have been surveying the
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities in schools for many years
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
they've been doing
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
um Hydro group net metering already
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
and they've been super excited about
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill with the five
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap and now we're dropping it
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
down to two megawatts sort of a surprise
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
and also a little unfair uh because they
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
were definitely getting ready to do this
 
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:26.990 align:start position:0%
were definitely getting ready to do this
um

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I I would just say that I I don't
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
think we need it uh I think that when
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about pilot that would be
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
a phased in approach and I know we've
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
done this in past years when we're
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
talking about net metering we would say
 
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay two megawatts in here one three
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
megawatts and year two four megawatts
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
and you're free
 
01:30:47.699 --> 01:30:48.770 align:start position:0%
and you're free
Etc

01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps we could come to a a fair
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
incremental approach for phasing in
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
rather than doing all this effort to
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
just go up by one megawatt when in
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
reality we've got Hydra chomping at the
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
bit at many municipalities who are
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
seeking to have this um
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comment I would
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
respond to that by saying that going
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
from one megawatt to two is sort of a
 
01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:19.340 align:start position:0%
phase-in of a program
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh oxygen is recognized
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
for a comment
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for taking my uh
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
discussion point
 
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm very concerned that we're a
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
step going back to a failed policy which
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
is one of putting caps on our programs
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh we've gotten rid of the cap this bill
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh goes puts the only effective barrier
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
is the one that ferc imposes which is
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
five megawatts instead of having these
 
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
perennial bills every year about lifting
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
we have a we have an opportunity to open
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
this up it's already limited you you the
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill is only applies to municipalities
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I I see no reason for for
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
re-establishing a cap
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington is
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I guess uh
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
since I believe this is still being paid
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
at the default service rate this is just
 
01:32:27.169 --> 01:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
another way of transferring more money
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
and two megawatts is not as bad as five
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
but it's still worse than one
 
01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of municipalities
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
especially small towns that simply don't
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to go out and build
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
either they don't have a hydro facility
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
they simply don't have the load to go
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
out and build multi-megawatt systems and
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
consume all the power so they wouldn't
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
be eligible because you have to consume
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
as much as you produce over the course
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
of a year but during the times when
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
these uh systems are exporting power to
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
the grid which they're going to do at
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
some time that's the whole idea of the
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
net metering concept otherwise they just
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
reduce their load this would give them
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
default Service rates and it's simply
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
what they put out is not the same value
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
as default service rate if anyone wants
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
additional information on that I'd be
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
glad to give it to them but those two
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
are not equal that megawatt coming out
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
of the net metering uh facility whether
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's Hydro or solar is it does not have
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
the same value as the megawatt being
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
provided by the default service provider
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
there's so much more in the default
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
service system involving guarantee that
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
you must provide it all the time
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
matching load to supply and demand you
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
always have to make sure you you have
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
enough there you have to pay extra have
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
extra generators on standby you have
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
contracts with because you may or may
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
not need them but if you do uh you they
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
need to be there but you've got to pay
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
them one way or the other you have to
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
comply with the the renewable portfolio
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
standard and of course all these people
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
in there charge money the utilities have
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
to cover their costs uh that's all based
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the default service rate what comes
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
out of the net metering his no
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide anything they can
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
turn it on or turn it off whenever they
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
want and if it's at a time on a Sunday
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
morning that's sunny in in May when the
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
utility oil doesn't need any more
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
electricity they have to buy it that's
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
what the way it is and that's not a very
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
valuable product and we shouldn't be
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
paying default service rate they're
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
lucky to get it to one megawatt as far
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Representatives
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
I understand the comment that represent
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
Harrington just made but I think that
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
that issue is something that we need to
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
talk about what a fair rate or net
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
metering is that's not what this bill is
 
01:34:58.450 --> 01:34:58.460 align:start position:0%
about this bill is about
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
basically helping local New Hampshire
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
power generators
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
efficiently use what they can generate
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
and what they can share with
 
01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.030 align:start position:0%
and what they can share with
municipalities

01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
to offset their their energy needs here
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire without having to
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
import more of it from somewhere else uh
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're trying to limit New
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire local power generation uh as
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
much as possible uh for places like the
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh like the monadnik paper mills and
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
other businesses and even towns that are
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
trying to uh uh partner with a local
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
Hydro for example uh to uh provide
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
service for the municipality I think we
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
should be doing everything possible to
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
encourage local power and creativity to
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
utilize New Hampshire's power generation
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
efficiently so it is this bill does
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
already limit it just to municipalities
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
it really should be expanded to all
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
businesses who think this might be an
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them as well so uh I
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
really think that that limiting it to
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
two two megawatts when even Nashua could
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
easily use more with their Hydro dams
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
right now and there are a number of
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
facilities throughout the state that are
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
looking into solar projects that would
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
exceed the two megawatt cap
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
uh if they could if it's a feasible and
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
financially reliable uh I think we're
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
limiting all these opportunities uh is
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
already quite quite a um detriment to
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh residents because we're
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
being dependent on on power from outside
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
our state why not encourage and utilize
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
them we don't need a pilot plant a
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
project here we have lots of towns who
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
already want to do this not just pilot
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
it but actually make it work so I I
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
really think that this bill limits that
 
01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.910 align:start position:0%
really think that this bill limits that
opportunity

01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Kelly Pitts
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
you will be next and I want to alert you
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the fact that I actually had to mute
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
you earlier because I think your
 
01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
microphone is in fact working
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
so try it again uh
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not hearing you now but I was
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
hearing you earlier when you were out
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
out of your chair I was hearing can you
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
hear me yes yes
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
there you go I
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
I was I've been on the phone all along
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
no we heard you when you weren't on the
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
phone Jackie when you spoke into the
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
screen we heard you
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and the little red microphone's gone
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
away you hear me now yes yes we do
 
01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:03.860 align:start position:0%
and you're recognize that question
 
01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
or a comment
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna do what's convenient
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
for me right now okay uh I I think that
 
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.649 align:start position:0%
for me right now okay uh I I think that
um

01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua if I if I remember when could go
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
up to three possibly four megawatts
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
and not not wanting to do a bill just
 
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
for one individual or one town
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
I want to ask Mr representative
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
Harrington if he knows how many
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
State sources we have that would be
 
01:38:41.699 --> 01:38:42.649 align:start position:0%
State sources we have that would be
capable

01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
capable
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
of going up up to five megawatts so that
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
would be the four I would believe if we
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
put in four there we'd be fine and
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
that's to avoid control so
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you recognized
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
are you there representative Harrington
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
you must have stepped away I'm sorry
 
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:13.070 align:start position:0%
you must have stepped away I'm sorry
Jackie

01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Jackie
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
um let's see representative Samson's
 
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
um let's see representative Samson's
recognized

01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
we do have Heidi Chrome the line yeah
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman my hand is not
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
raised on I just forgot to take it down
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative Thomas
 
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
is recognized
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair just for the
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
record uh for clarity
 
01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.689 align:start position:0%
record uh for clarity
um

01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're not limiting
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they can actually build I mean it's
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
something that's preventing them from
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
going the three or four megawatts but
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
yet the words I'm hearing is that we're
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
limiting them uh to to Ohio could you
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that difference for the record
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
yes basically this just limits the
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
amount that they can net meter
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
to two minutes not the amount that they
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
can build that you're absolutely right
 
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
about that right
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives hemantel is
 
01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:15.649 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives hemantel is
recognized

01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
first of all if we're talking about a
 
01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:22.699 align:start position:0%
pilot program probably
 
01:40:26.169 --> 01:40:26.179 align:start position:0%
Nashua would make a great pilot program
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh they certainly have the wherewithal
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
to be successful at it
 
01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:36.260 align:start position:0%
and my other point is that if we're
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned about bringing it to
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
five megawatts because of
 
01:40:45.169 --> 01:40:45.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
um but since there isn't even Nashua
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't approach five megawatts I guess
 
01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere between three and four so
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
why not make it the five because that's
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
pretty much the legal limit
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
let the thing let's get it out of
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee let's get it out of the the
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
house and let's let
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh LED it to do its job and um
 
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh we can just
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
stand back and watch it happen
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Platt is
 
01:41:24.649 --> 01:41:24.659 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
all right I guess representative Herrick
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
had made the point earlier you raised
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
the limit your shifting crossed under
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
every other ratepayer we look like
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
Heroes when we reduce somebody's rates
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
like Nashua but it's on the backs of
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
everybody else and and so uh I think you
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
bet your answer this is not going to get
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
through with smoothly uh with a vote on
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
Monday so it's going to be routine
 
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that point uh
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
I think my town is a is a town that has
 
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh invested in in solar on its you know
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
schools School roof panels and we also
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
have you know pellet burners in our
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings so we've made a lot
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
of conversions uh to get uh
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know to get going on our plans for
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
trying to get to zero emissions by 2050.
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
so like many towns we've tried to make
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
those plans work
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
what is not workable is is that the
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
amount of credit that you could be
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
earning if we had a proper net metering
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
program is is unavailable to give people
 
01:42:41.209 --> 01:42:41.219 align:start position:0%
um the benefit of investing in local
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
sustainable clean energy sources which
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
is something we want to incent so the
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
way we're talking about it is that there
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
is a shift of costs if Hollis invests in
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
these things and then lowers its
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
electricity consumption because it is
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
generating local clean sustainable
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
energy and no longer purchasing that
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
energy from a fossil fuel producer
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
there is no shifting of costs there is a
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
lowering of the amount of costs that we
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
will be generating
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
and then there is the additional lowered
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
costs for the taxpayers in my town if we
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
are recouping money under a net metering
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
program that actually values the amount
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the energy that we're producing and
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
so that goes to representative
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington's point where he's saying the
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
value of a net metered energy should not
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
be equal to default service but that
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
value of net metered energy is
 
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
determined through a process that looks
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
at what is the value of a net metered
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know net metered energy so I think
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
that we're talking in circles on many of
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
the issues here there is no rate cost
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
shifting it's not a zero-sum game if my
 
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
town invests and lowers what we have to
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
pay for fossil fuels it doesn't go on to
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
your cost for fossil fuels fossil fuels
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
still costs what fossil fuels cost we've
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
just lowered Our Town costs and lowered
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
the rates of our utility bills for all
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers in our town so that's a
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
goal Republicans and Democrats talk
 
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
about all the time is figuring out how
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
do we lower taxes
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
in municipalities and this the reason
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
we're supporting this bill and looking
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
to get this bill through at the highest
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
level possible is that
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
this is a vehicle where we can lower
 
01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.310 align:start position:0%
this is a vehicle where we can lower
costs

01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
um people will have some
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
self-determination in being able to
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
lower their costs that's what's good
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
about it and so I would push back on the
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
idea that uh that the rate setting isn't
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate the way it's done I mean
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
there's people that that's all they do
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
is pay attention to that so it's it
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
isn't equivalent to uh to the default
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
service rate it's
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
set as a net meter grade which is
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
um for that very reason but it does have
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
a value so I guess that's where the
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
argument seems to be between us is
 
01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:06.649 align:start position:0%
argument seems to be between us is
whether

01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
whether it should be valued
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
but I I disagree with the idea that if
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
if my town lowers its costs that
 
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
somebody else's town has to pick up
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxenham is
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair for taking
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
my comment and for pointing out that it
 
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
is indeed a comment I do appreciate that
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
um yes as as to the points made by
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here what we're
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish is lower the load
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
which at particularly lowering the load
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
at the time of peak which is when the
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
greatest charges are imposed Upon Our
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
those who are customers of the
 
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
electrical grid
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
and when you lower the peak you lower
 
01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
costs to everyone the recently um the
 
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
synapse group brought out a study
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost of electricity in
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
New England and they found that the
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
value of renewable energy is greater
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
than the default service charge and it
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
they have a range of values in there but
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
even at the lowest it is in excess of
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
the default service charge so that that
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
really isn't an appropriate
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has pointed out
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the cost shifting argument is is
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
not a valid argument against this we are
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a transition to a clean
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
energy economy we have been working for
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
decades to increase the amount of
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
renewable energy to increase our Energy
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and in this year with what we
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
have seen with the Gulf Stream changes
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
with the wildfires you you all know the
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
litany and I won't list them here we
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
know we have to change the U.S Chamber
 
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
of Commerce has just come out with a
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
position paper
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
saying that climate is changing humans
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
are contributing to the changes we need
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
an effective climate policy and they're
 
01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:27.659 align:start position:0%
looking for market-based Solutions
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
we need to be working together on this
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
and moving away from these old arguments
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting which have been
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
exploded again and again so please let
 
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
us move forward with this bill it's very
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
limited it only applies to the
 
01:47:44.219 --> 01:47:45.709 align:start position:0%
limited it only applies to the
municipalities

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
but we need to be getting rid of caps
 
01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
and obstacles where they exist in
 
01:47:54.590 --> 01:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
statute thank you
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
hemantel it's recognized for a comment
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr chairman uh kind of
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
reiterating a little bit what's said
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
here is it
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
any first of all we're not cost shifting
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
at all from the from uh these net meter
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
to other rate Pairs and if in fact we're
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
lowering the cost for everyone because
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
we're lowering uh transmission by
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
creating electricity locally and by
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
lowering transmission or lowering the
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
cost for every rate payer not just the
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
ones that are uh being net metered
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
I I think we have to just
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh look at this as benefits to everybody
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if you look at the uh
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
that transmission costs that
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
transmission cost is divided uh among
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh participants and Reggie based on
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
percentages of uh electricity
 
01:49:04.199 --> 01:49:05.810 align:start position:0%
percentages of uh electricity
transmitted

01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
transmitted
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
our other our neighbors are lowering
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
their transmission costs whereas we're
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
just kind of sitting there and so as a
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
percentage we're going to be paying a
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
higher and higher amount of that
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
percentage of the transmission costs
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington is
 
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:36.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington is
recognized

01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute representative
 
01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:45.250 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute representative
Harrington

01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay representative Harrington doesn't
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
appear to be there so
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative Lang are you available
 
01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
I am sir thank you very much I apologize
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
I was over at election law presenting a
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
or clarify things I've been listening to
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
the discussion for the last uh 10-15
 
01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:05.629 align:start position:0%
the discussion for the last uh 10-15
minutes

01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
earlier in the discussion uh
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Pimentel had a question
 
01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.129 align:start position:0%
representative Pimentel had a question
about

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
the line in uh the bill that says a
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
municipal house shall be located in the
 
01:50:21.169 --> 01:50:21.179 align:start position:0%
same municipality as all group members
 
01:50:23.649 --> 01:50:23.659 align:start position:0%
if the facility begin operation after
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2020.
 
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:28.460 align:start position:0%
can you explain what that line means
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for letting me
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
answer this question so the intention
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
around this question is around uh
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
hydropower in that Hydro without
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
building any new Hydro but we want to
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
make Hydro available to be able to
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
consider itself a municipal Host this
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
um the hydro to be able to uh be able to
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
do that work uh do that act as a um
 
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.209 align:start position:0%
do that work uh do that act as a um
uh

01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:59.689 --> 01:50:59.699 align:start position:0%
Municipal host generator even if they're
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
um outside the municipality so I'll use
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
Bosque when as an example so if the
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
Bosque and hydro wanted to sell 100 of
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
its power to the city of Concord it's
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
not exactly like Bosco Hydro could pick
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
up their Dam and move it inside the city
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
of Concord but we want to give them the
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to participate in
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
that group that metering and as long as
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
they had 100 of one Community absorbing
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
that uh that energy and so by putting
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
that language in
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
um the idea was that
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
um someone like Bosque and hydro would
 
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
be able to sell to the city of Concord
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
as long as on the same grid provider or
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
same same provider
 
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.229 align:start position:0%
same same provider
yeah

01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so next up for a question
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
and I unmuted myself can you imagine
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if the uh thinking
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
about capacity for the um
 
01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:54.980 align:start position:0%
whether a little thinking about capacity
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
that the utility has to maintain in the
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
face of
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the possible
 
01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.350 align:start position:0%
um you know the possible
um

01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
uh accidents in these uh distributed
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
sites uh were there a discussion of that
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
we might make this thing a little easier
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more complicated but it
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
might be a little easier to take the uh
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
position of uh you know trying to uh
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
accommodate large
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
renewable systems
 
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
without you know necessarily affecting
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh or you know causing the utilities to
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
have to bear
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable or um
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
in a sense that they'd have to raise
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
their ability to
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
replace the Renewables if the Renewables
 
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.649 align:start position:0%
replace the Renewables if the Renewables
don't

01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
um if they shut down for any reason and
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
the cost for that capacity would have to
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
be distributed
 
01:52:59.209 --> 01:52:59.219 align:start position:0%
to everybody so I'm I'm going against a
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the discussion that uh my party
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
is talking about but if we just admitted
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
that and put that into the equation it
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
it might be a small matter and we could
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
stop worrying about it
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Callie Pitts is
 
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.750 align:start position:0%
um representative Callie Pitts is
recognized

01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I had asked
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington a question but
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
and I'll get that probably I hope on
 
01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:26.219 align:start position:0%
Monday but I'm going to ask you uh my
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
opinion is that government is the art of
 
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
compromise would you be willing to go
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
with fractions the way I learned them in
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
school and instead of going to two
 
01:53:38.890 --> 01:53:38.900 align:start position:0%
make it three
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh megawatts because that would seem to
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
accommodate what you want to do would be
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
Nashville would be in a position to do a
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
a pilot at three megawatts I believe
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I heard
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
please forgive me I can't see so I can't
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
go back and look at my notes I mean I
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
can believe it not very well
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I believe that would work would you
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
accept three megawatts
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
instead of the two
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and I
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
guess I'm going to view this in the same
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
way we talked about this last year on
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
the same bill is I I if if two is what's
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to get it through the committee
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
with an OTP in the past and I'd rather
 
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
take the baby step and get the two if we
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
can get the three that's great but if it
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
three stops it from passing I don't want
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
I don't want three
 
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:28.139 align:start position:0%
um I I want to see progress made in this
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
industry I think we it's reliable and
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
one thing I'll remind everybody is that
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about Municipal house
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
generators we're talking about group
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
debt metering and that the consumption
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
has to be at 100 and so regardless of
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
what the number is we're not talking
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
about default Service rates at the end
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the year they have to True up how
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
much should they consume how much they
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
produce and if they produce more than it
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
consumes actually uh and they got paid
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
for it then they have to actually pay
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
money back to the utility
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
um to the wholesale rate if I'm not
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
mistaken and so
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind that so we talk
 
01:54:59.570 --> 01:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting that's not
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily happening here because again
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
this is group net metering in the
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
minutes when we're talking about
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal host generators
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
um grouping all the meters together
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
under one utility in their for it has to
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
be 100 your consumption has to be equal
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
to your generation and it's not really
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
talking about payments back to from the
 
01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.490 align:start position:0%
talking about payments back to from the
um utilities

01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
um utilities
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
may I follow up
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
the only thing I wanted to say was that
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
again I think if we moved a little bit
 
01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
again I think if we moved a little bit
maybe

01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak for the other side but
 
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think maybe the other side is willing
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
to move forward a little bit more and we
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
can get this thing out with bipartisan
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
acceptance which I think would be a good
 
01:55:44.699 --> 01:55:45.590 align:start position:0%
acceptance which I think would be a good
thing

01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's all I agree you have all
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
reasonable people in the Science and
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Tech committee that should be able to
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
work out the details
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Representatives uh
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative samstich is recognized
 
01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
um yes I I so agree with uh represent
 
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
Kelly pitts's comment
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
um first of all uh representative Lang
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
just pointed out that in this this bill
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
because the municipality has to consume
 
01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:18.179 align:start position:0%
its own energy there's absolutely no
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
chance of any kind of cost shifting
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
going on but the puc has already looked
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
at this issue of of net metering
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
shifting costs to other rate Pairs and
 
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
has said that officially that there is
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
no noticeable effect so this has already
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
been determined that there is no cost
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
shifting going on currently
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
um but represent Lang what I would like
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
to ask you is um
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
if you only have the two megawatt my
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is that doesn't help
 
01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
Nashua too much am I incorrect
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
it helps them twice as much as they have
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
are able to do right now and I guess
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's you know I I'll take from one to
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
two any day from one to one so you know
 
01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
it does does help it may not help as
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
much as they want and again as I said
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the art of compromise and
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
moving some something forward rather
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
than nothing forward
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and and uh so again well I I would
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
use I put the bill in originally
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
uncapped because again I thought that uh
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
uh again because I knew it was group net
 
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
meter we weren't dealing with
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
um we were dealing with that 100
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
consumption from 100 of generations so
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't worried about it but if this
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
committee can come to an agreement other
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
than five or other than uh two that's
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's completely acceptable to me but
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and again I I the idea was not to
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
have the discussion about cost shipping
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman yes follow up and
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be stopping in two minutes
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay just a clarification of represent
 
01:57:45.659 --> 01:57:46.669 align:start position:0%
okay just a clarification of represent
Lang

01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
Lang
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to what the situation
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
is in Nashua currently what what is the
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
the maximum right now that they could
 
01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:57.260 align:start position:0%
actually do
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is they'd be able
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
to group net they they could group net
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
meter up to up to a megawatt right now
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken and then anything
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
over that would be a problem for him on
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
on I I think you misunderstood me what
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if there was a if there was
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
no cap what is Nashville currently able
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
to generate on their own from their
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities I honestly don't know
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
the answer that I don't know what I I
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't know I do know they're about 20
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the state
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
looking to implement some sort of
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
um solar or uh or uh solar mostly uh
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
programs to help offset the rising
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
electricity costs to help the operating
 
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
budgets of those towns well I I did
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
visit Nashville I visited those Hydro
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
facilities there and my understanding is
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
from that visit that they could generate
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
anywhere between three and four
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
megawatts if they were allowed to if
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
there was no Camp involved
 
01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:54.890 align:start position:0%
there was no Camp involved
hey

01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%

all right let's get started uh uh 104.
 
03:05:32.570 --> 03:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
yeah from now until whenever they're
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
finished I'm going to turn over the rest
 
03:05:38.570 --> 03:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the or turn over the session to the
 
03:05:40.610 --> 03:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services who
 
03:05:43.130 --> 03:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
will give us a presentation and help us
 
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
learn a lot about the programs that much
 
03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
as the legislation we deal with affects
 
03:05:52.370 --> 03:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
so without further Ado Mike Fitzgerald
 
03:05:54.050 --> 03:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Environmental
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
Services air Resources Division the
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
floor is yours
 
03:06:00.530 --> 03:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:06:01.730 --> 03:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
um Mike Fitzgerald I'm the assistant
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
director of the air Resources Division
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
um pleased to be with you today I'm
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
joined by the director of the air
 
03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
Resources Division Craig Wright I just
 
03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
want to say at the outset um I
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
understand there's been some concern
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
about getting this presentation
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled and I want to acknowledge that
 
03:06:20.510 --> 03:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
it was clear just simply my fault that I
 
03:06:22.490 --> 03:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
missed the original invitation back in
 
03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
January and uh by the time I was able to
 
03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
connect with the chair and it was too
 
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
late to schedule so uh we want to
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it was uh not not an
 
03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
oversight but we're pleased to be here
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
with you today
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to turn this over to uh

director Wright
 
03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
and uh he'll handle most of the
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
presentation uh he'll do the uh the hard
 
03:06:52.490 --> 03:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
part and I'll do the the easy part at
 
03:06:55.250 --> 03:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
the end and then uh I also am joined by
 
03:06:58.849 --> 03:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh Catherine beam and Rebecca ohler at
 
03:06:59.630 --> 03:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
the end
 
03:07:01.250 --> 03:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
um perhaps Jennifer if you could uh
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
Elevate them to speaking in case there
 
03:07:06.370 --> 03:07:06.380 align:start position:0%
are questions I might want to have them
 
03:07:09.170 --> 03:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh respond in case you stump the Chumps
 
03:07:09.180 --> 03:07:11.210 align:start position:0%
uh respond in case you stump the Chumps
so

03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll turn it over to Craig
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh thanks Mike hey it's really great to
 
03:07:18.769 --> 03:07:18.779 align:start position:0%
see everybody uh I I ingest uh earlier
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
said it's great to have Mike down there
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%

03:07:23.929 --> 03:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
with you guys and I hope he serves you
 
03:07:25.849 --> 03:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
well I know he does I I do listen in on
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
occasion to what he has to say so thanks
 
03:07:29.690 --> 03:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
Mike for being representative of the air
 
03:07:31.730 --> 03:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
division down at St e greatly appreciate
 
03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:32.690 align:start position:0%
division down at St e greatly appreciate
it

03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
um Mike could you go slide please sure
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
so we have about 30 35 slides we'll try
 
03:07:40.490 --> 03:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
to run through them I I don't think
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
it'll take more than a minute to slide
 
03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly available for
 
03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:44.809 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly available for
questions

03:07:44.809 --> 03:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
um if you have questions during the
 
03:07:48.110 --> 03:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
presentation feel free to interrupt or
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh probably use you to go right to the
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
end and then have questions but we'll
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the committee's choice
 
03:07:55.010 --> 03:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
so anyways what you see here is a
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
functional log chart of the Year
 
03:07:56.760 --> 03:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
functional log chart of the Year
division

03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
um before I talk about that though I did
 
03:08:01.849 --> 03:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
want to mention uh similar to most of
 
03:08:04.010 --> 03:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
you the air division is largely working
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
in a remote environment due to covid uh
 
03:08:09.050 --> 03:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
we've been about 90 95 percent of our
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
staff have been working from home for
 
03:08:13.490 --> 03:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
almost a year now it's hard to believe
 
03:08:15.889 --> 03:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
um I think we would assess uh besides
 
03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
getting out of the building and getting
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
people transitioned to a new work
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
environment I would say we've been
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
highly effective and highly efficient
 
03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
and uh can't be more pleased with how
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
our staff has performed uh during this
 
03:08:28.610 --> 03:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
time so and with that I'll just quickly
 
03:08:30.530 --> 03:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
point out we have three bureaus and a
 
03:08:31.790 --> 03:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
director's office our permitting
 
03:08:34.130 --> 03:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
environmental health Bureau obviously
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is where you come get an air permit
 
03:08:37.490 --> 03:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
whether it's a state permit or a federal
 
03:08:40.130 --> 03:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
permit you come to Des you don't need to
 
03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
go to EPA we can hit we can handle all
 
03:08:45.290 --> 03:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
Air permit needs there's about 40
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
chapters of air regulations that are
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
applicable to our regulated community
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
and there are literally hundreds of
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
federal standards as well so we do a lot
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
of technical assistance and Outreach to
 
03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
our regulated Community we also have an
 
03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
environmental health program here this
 
03:09:01.610 --> 03:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
is important to point out because this
 
03:09:03.769 --> 03:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
group not only serves the air division
 
03:09:05.929 --> 03:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
but also serves the Water Division and
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
the waste divisions as well so this is a
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
a we've got two new positions a couple
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
years ago out of the pfas situation
 
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
going on to do some toxicology work and
 
03:09:20.090 --> 03:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
we've just re-established our atsdr
 
03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
environmental health program that we
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
have lost funding for back in 2017 so
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
really proud there our compliance Bureau
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
this is our boots on the ground these
 
03:09:29.210 --> 03:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
are the people out in the field these
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
are the people doing the inspections uh
 
03:09:33.290 --> 03:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
climbing the stacks witnessing the stack
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
tests this is our emissions inventory
 
03:09:39.050 --> 03:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
group our enforcement group we also have
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
an asbestos demo demo rental program
 
03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
that is run through the year Division
 
03:09:44.929 --> 03:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
and that's in our compliance Bureau as
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
well Technical Services Bureau it's kind
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
of our catch-all Bureau that's the where
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mike cut his teeth in the air division
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh coming out of the technical services
 
03:09:53.929 --> 03:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
Bureau this is our mobile Source
 
03:09:56.210 --> 03:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
programs this is our air monitoring I'll
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
be talking about that in a minute uh
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is where we have our clean energy
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
programs uh this is obviously where we
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
house our Reggie program that most of
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
you are probably familiar with and a lot
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
of our legislative activity has tracked
 
03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
this Bureau and hence that's why you see
 
03:10:11.330 --> 03:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
Mike lot and that's currently headed up
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
by Becky oler as well then we have the
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
director's office uh one thing we know
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
about air pollution that doesn't it
 
03:10:18.830 --> 03:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't end New Hampshire's borders and
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't start at New Hampshire's borders
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
so we have to play a role both
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
regionally and nationally to ensure that
 
03:10:26.030 --> 03:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
our air is clean here in New Hampshire
 
03:10:29.450 --> 03:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
as well next slide Mike
 
03:10:31.849 --> 03:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
this is just our contact information for
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
our senior senior staff in the in the
 
03:10:36.050 --> 03:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
division stops right at the top here
 
03:10:37.309 --> 03:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's why we only have two numbers
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
listed you feel free to call any of
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
those other folks but also feel free to
 
03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
call me and Mike with on any issues and
 
03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get we'll get you pointed in the
 
03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
right direction uh so feel free to reach
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
out to us Mike next
 
03:10:52.610 --> 03:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
so just a quick overview of what we do
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
in addition to the all the state laws uh
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
that regulate air boost in New Hampshire
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's really important to note that the
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
air division has taken on the vast
 
03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
majority and has been delegated most of
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
the federal programs under the Clean Air
 
03:11:08.809 --> 03:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
Act Amendments of 1990. included in that
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility is our requirement to
 
03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
monitor air quality of the state I have
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
a slide coming up on that so I won't
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
talk much about that it's really up to
 
03:11:18.769 --> 03:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
the state EPA sets the Hep this
 
03:11:20.269 --> 03:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
health-based standards that we need to
 
03:11:22.429 --> 03:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
meet if we fail to meet them it's up to
 
03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
the state to come up with programs and
 
03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
ways to implement control strategies to
 
03:11:28.730 --> 03:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
meet those federal act quality standards
 
03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
so we spend an awful lot of time working
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
with EPA again
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal air permits again
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop here you come Des don't
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
need to go see EPA uh again compliance
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
inspections were out in the field we
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
negotiated an annual inspection plan
 
03:11:45.769 --> 03:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
with EPA EPA oversees our enforcement
 
03:11:47.809 --> 03:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
activities we go through periodic audits
 
03:11:50.990 --> 03:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
on both those inspection programs and on
 
03:11:53.330 --> 03:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
our enforcement programs and I'm very
 
03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that we very rarely get
 
03:11:57.769 --> 03:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
any significant comments from EPA so
 
03:11:59.330 --> 03:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
we're doing our good we're doing a good
 
03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
we're doing our good we're doing a good
deed

03:12:00.230 --> 03:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
deed
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
our AMD staff we have 69 full-time
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
positions 16 of them are currently
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
vacant that's almost one out of uh one
 
03:12:08.570 --> 03:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
out of four uh is vacant here in the
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
division we are trying to fill some
 
03:12:11.469 --> 03:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
positions right now of course with
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
coveted similar to most state agencies
 
03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh we had some issues with being able to
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
fill positions for a while but we are
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
moving to fill
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
um at least four of those positions
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
um this is a a constant struggle as
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
keeping positions filled in state
 
03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:27.290 align:start position:0%
keeping positions filled in state

03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
civil very technical reviews that we do
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the permitting side we have

03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
we even have a couple attorneys on staff
 
03:12:43.250 --> 03:12:43.260 align:start position:0%

03:12:46.849 --> 03:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
slide
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
this just gives you a sense of our
 
03:12:50.330 --> 03:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
um if you look at this bar chart the
 
03:12:53.809 --> 03:12:53.819 align:start position:0%
first thing you would probably know
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
going back almost going back 11 years
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
here this is relatively flat we have not
 
03:13:01.010 --> 03:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
seen increased revenues in the air
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
division for over 10 years uh anybody
 
03:13:05.809 --> 03:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
who knows understands math and the
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
economy uh what you could buy in FY 10
 
03:13:10.730 --> 03:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
for 7 million dollars a year and what
 
03:13:12.290 --> 03:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
you can buy an FY 20 two different
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
things the rate of inflation the cost of
 
03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
keeping staff on board so we've been
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
relatively flat funded for over 10 years
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
our biggest source of Revenue is those
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
blue bars that's our permitted sources
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
our regulated Community they pay almost
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the operating budget of
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the air division our second biggest
 
03:13:31.490 --> 03:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
funding source is the federal government
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
those little green bars a little mix in
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
with the yellow bar those are minor
 
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
programs mobile sources although mobile
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
sources Remain the biggest source of
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
emissions in the State uh they're
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
relatively small part of our Revenue
 
03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
generation you'll notice a little bit of
 
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
an increase in the red bar which is a
 
03:13:49.730 --> 03:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
general fund program funding for the
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
division that didn't increase in FY 18
 
03:13:54.230 --> 03:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
and 19 as I mentioned those two new
 
03:13:55.969 --> 03:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
positions that came on board related to
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
pfos in addition there was some support
 
03:14:02.570 --> 03:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
of our air permit program through FY 19
 
03:14:06.889 --> 03:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
20 21 we expect that will be gone in the
 
03:14:09.349 --> 03:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
next budget looking out to 22.23 so
 
03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
you'll see that red bar probably shrink
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit in the future years
 
03:14:16.610 --> 03:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
so very much dependent on fees and the
 
03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
federal government to maintain our
 
03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:19.490 align:start position:0%
federal government to maintain our
programs

03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
um we believe that maintaining good air
 
03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
quality is important for the environment
 
03:14:24.230 --> 03:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
and we think it's important for the
 
03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:25.490 align:start position:0%
and we think it's important for the
economy

03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:14:26.690 --> 03:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
um one of the things under the Clean Air
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
Act is if you don't meet the federal air
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
quality standards it's up to the state
 
03:14:32.090 --> 03:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
to come up with rules and regulations
 
03:14:33.769 --> 03:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
and you know who's who who's going to be
 
03:14:35.450 --> 03:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
the subject of that it's going to be our
 
03:14:37.010 --> 03:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
regulated sources it's going to be our
 
03:14:39.230 --> 03:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
industry it's going to be part of our
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
economic base so it's it's our best
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
interest to meet the federal air quality
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
standards that of course is the public
 
03:14:48.650 --> 03:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
health costs um obviously pair poor air
 
03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
quality means increased health care
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
costs for New Hampshire especially as an
 
03:14:55.010 --> 03:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
aging State we know one thing air
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
pollution disproportionately impacts The
 
03:15:00.230 --> 03:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
Young and the elderly in terms of impact
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
so and good air helps our forests let's
 
03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
face it to have a healthy Forest need
 
03:15:07.250 --> 03:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
good air a healthy Forest means
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining soils in place controlling
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
runoff means clean water so I think it's
 
03:15:13.309 --> 03:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
all interconnected and I think we're
 
03:15:16.250 --> 03:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
very pleased to play our role we all
 
03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire is a beautiful state
 
03:15:19.610 --> 03:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
people come here for our mountains our
 
03:15:22.250 --> 03:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
views our clean Lakes well it all ties
 
03:15:24.769 --> 03:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
back to the economy in my mind so very
 
03:15:27.170 --> 03:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
important linkage there
 
03:15:29.950 --> 03:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
next slide Mike
 
03:15:32.210 --> 03:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh clean air activity this is really
 
03:15:34.610 --> 03:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
like I said has been the driving force
 
03:15:36.889 --> 03:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
um I actually started in 1988 at the
 
03:15:39.769 --> 03:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
division and so I've seen the amount of
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
changes and regulations that came out of
 
03:15:43.730 --> 03:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 one
 
03:15:45.710 --> 03:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the things EPA does is set what we
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
call these National ambient air quality
 
03:15:49.550 --> 03:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
standards for the criteria pollutants
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
they're listed there we pretty much have
 
03:15:54.530 --> 03:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
had some sort of issue with every one of
 
03:15:56.450 --> 03:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
those pollutants at some time going back
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh into the early 70s and 80s at one
 
03:16:01.490 --> 03:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
point carbon monoxide used to be the big
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
problem due to motor vehicle traffic up
 
03:16:05.450 --> 03:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
north I mean sorry the southern part of
 
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
the State uh sulfur dioxide was an issue
 
03:16:09.769 --> 03:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
around the Merrimack power station for
 
03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
for a number of years ozone's been our
 
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
biggest Boogeyman uh since I've been
 
03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
around uh has been our biggest
 
03:16:17.389 --> 03:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory driver it's been our biggest
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
challenge particular matter I think is
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the potential pollutant of the future
 
03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that's one that's gonna
 
03:16:26.450 --> 03:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
continue to get more and more attention
 
03:16:29.330 --> 03:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
as we move forward into the future EPA
 
03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
also regulates hazardous air pollutants
 
03:16:33.769 --> 03:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's a technology-based
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
program where EPA sets technology
 
03:16:39.050 --> 03:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
standards for certain size sources and
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
then they need to meet certain control
 
03:16:43.190 --> 03:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
criteria New Hampshire has its own air
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
toxics program that's more of a
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
health-based program where we have
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
health-based standards for over 600 air
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
pollutants air toxins
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
one thing about the naxes to recall
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
remember is that the science doesn't sit
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
still on impacts of air pollution
 
03:17:02.830 --> 03:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
um on on the human body and human health
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
EPA is required to review the Knacks
 
03:17:08.090 --> 03:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
every five years they generally get more
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
astringent over time as science gets
 
03:17:11.570 --> 03:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
better as is a better understanding of
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
how air pollution impacts the human
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
health so EPA doesn't always meet that
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
five-year Target I'll be honest with you
 
03:17:20.450 --> 03:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh but they are going through this
 
03:17:21.950 --> 03:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
process right now on a couple of the
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
again just this issue of attainment
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
non-attainment non-attainment is
 
03:17:31.730 --> 03:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
probably not really a word in the
 
03:17:33.650 --> 03:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
regular dictionary but it is a big word
 
03:17:35.330 --> 03:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the air pollution World
 
03:17:36.769 --> 03:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
um this means if you're not
 
03:17:38.450 --> 03:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
entertainment means you don't meet those
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
Federal health-based standards uh that
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
triggers a whole slew of requirements on
 
03:17:45.889 --> 03:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
the state we've lived that primarily
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
through ozone for the past 20 years I
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
can say we are now currently attainment
 
03:17:54.170 --> 03:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
which is good for New Hampshire we're in
 
03:17:55.550 --> 03:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
a maintenance mode it doesn't mean we
 
03:17:57.230 --> 03:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't occasionally have poor air quality
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh but it's it's the better of the two
 
03:18:02.269 --> 03:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
places to be into in two I can assure
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
you with that uh we're kind of in a
 
03:18:06.110 --> 03:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance mode at some level but we
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
can't backslide the Clean Air Act does
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
not allow you to go backwards so we need
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
to continue our due diligence and
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
regulating air pollution in the state
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.849 --> 03:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of our federal money we get
 
03:18:24.769 --> 03:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
from EPA this is where we probably spend
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
the most of our federal money on our air
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring program we monitor air
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
quality literally from the top of Mount
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
Washington uh to the base of Mount
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
Washington down the Connecticut River
 
03:18:37.849 --> 03:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
Valley across the Southern Tier over the
 
03:18:39.530 --> 03:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
Seacoast in up the Merrimack River
 
03:18:39.540 --> 03:18:40.730 align:start position:0%
Seacoast in up the Merrimack River
Valley

03:18:40.730 --> 03:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
Valley
 
03:18:42.290 --> 03:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
you can see on the left the pollutants
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
that we March before we don't monitor
 
03:18:46.450 --> 03:18:46.460 align:start position:0%
for all those pollutants at every site
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
these are very scientifically chosen
 
03:18:51.170 --> 03:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
sites for example some people would say
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
why are you monitoring up on top of
 
03:18:54.730 --> 03:18:54.740 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington well Mount Washington
 
03:18:57.050 --> 03:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
Believe It or Not sometimes has some of
 
03:18:58.730 --> 03:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
the worst ozone pollution in the state
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
generally that's early in the season uh
 
03:19:04.010 --> 03:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's an indicator of probably Air
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
transport into the state uh that's one
 
03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we like to monitor at
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
high elevations we also have a second
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
high elevation site in the southern part
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
of State on top of back when that dock
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
but like for example Lebanon we monitor
 
03:19:18.290 --> 03:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
ozone there we don't monitor any other
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
pollutant there Laconia we monitor ozone
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
and we are doing some temporary
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
monitoring on carbon monoxide so in
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
Pembroke we only monitor for SO2 uh we
 
03:19:29.570 --> 03:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
have that's just downwind of the
 
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
Merrimack station power plant
 
03:19:33.530 --> 03:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
um so that's literally a monitor cited
 
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
to monitor uh One Source in the state so
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
um Nashville obviously is one of our
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
congested areas same with Portsmouth and
 
03:19:42.769 --> 03:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
Rye so this is very indicative of our
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
heavily uh populated parts of the state
 
03:19:47.090 --> 03:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
so next slide Mike
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
this is just some examples of our
 
03:19:51.530 --> 03:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
monitoring sites uh Miller State Park
 
03:19:52.849 --> 03:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
um in Londonderry I'd like to point
 
03:19:55.250 --> 03:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
those two out to people uh we use these
 
03:19:57.290 --> 03:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
as educational sites if possible uh
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
Pac-Man Miller State Park obviously sees
 
03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of foot traffic up there we try to
 
03:20:04.250 --> 03:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh communicate with the traveling public
 
03:20:05.929 --> 03:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
on the benefits of long-term Trail
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
pollution and what they can do to help
 
03:20:10.490 --> 03:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
air pollution I would say each one of
 
03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
these sites probably has somewhere in
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood of probably a quarter
 
03:20:15.650 --> 03:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars worth of equipment
 
03:20:16.849 --> 03:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
inside of it
 
03:20:16.859 --> 03:20:17.630 align:start position:0%
inside of it
um

03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of the money we spend on this
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
program is Manpower related uh we do
 
03:20:26.809 --> 03:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
spend some money on new equipment we
 
03:20:27.889 --> 03:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
primarily get that through Capital
 
03:20:27.899 --> 03:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
primarily get that through Capital
funding

03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:34.670 --> 03:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
the area permitting program again this
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
is a One-Stop shop for anybody who needs
 
03:20:38.929 --> 03:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
a permit uh we have almost 800 permanent
 
03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state 30 of them are
 
03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
the federal permits required that's our
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
title five sources these are your big
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
Power Plant your large industrial
 
03:20:49.490 --> 03:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
sources and then we have uh over 770
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
State sources a couple things I'll point
 
03:20:52.090 --> 03:20:52.100 align:start position:0%
out here
 
03:20:54.290 --> 03:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
415 General permits for emergency
 
03:20:56.510 --> 03:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
generators and the 86 permit by
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
notifications on Rock crushing
 
03:20:59.929 --> 03:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
operations those are completely online
 
03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
permitting processes and we're really
 
03:21:03.410 --> 03:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
proud and that's something we're going
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
to continue to try to expand upon for
 
03:21:08.690 --> 03:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
our other 269 sources there is to try to
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
get them into the online permitting
 
03:21:12.410 --> 03:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
process as well
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that was just a picture of Merrimack
 
03:21:15.410 --> 03:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
station there I'm sure many of you seen
 
03:21:17.210 --> 03:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
that as you drive up and down Route 93
 
03:21:19.610 --> 03:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
right through here in Concord so uh Mike
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
03:21:24.230 --> 03:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
again our compliance permit program we
 
03:21:25.610 --> 03:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
spend an awful lot of time out in the
 
03:21:28.490 --> 03:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
field again negotiating with EPA uh the
 
03:21:30.170 --> 03:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
sources we're going to conduct despite
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
covet in 2020 largely we can still
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
conducted 82 Source inspections they
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
were modified uh they were more uh
 
03:21:40.130 --> 03:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
enhanced record reviews site
 
03:21:41.889 --> 03:21:41.899 align:start position:0%
surveillance that type of stuff less
 
03:21:41.899 --> 03:21:43.630 align:start position:0%
surveillance that type of stuff less
in-person

03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
in-person
 
03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
inspections we are looking at doing some
 
03:21:48.410 --> 03:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
sort of remote inspections in the future
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
something we're watching some of our
 
03:21:52.250 --> 03:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
states especially out west the largest
 
03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
states tend to do a lot more remote
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
inspections so we'll take taking
 
03:21:57.769 --> 03:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
advantage of Technology that's something
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hopefully do in the future
 
03:22:02.170 --> 03:22:02.180 align:start position:0%
as well we have we responded to over 88
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
complaints in 2020 uh we go out and do
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
the stack tests uh generally companies
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
hire a third party where they had to
 
03:22:12.889 --> 03:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
observe witness oversee verify uh the
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
test is done correctly in accordance
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
with EPA standards we did that at 51
 
03:22:20.210 --> 03:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
sites in 2020 again despite uh covid
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
that was a very normal number in terms
 
03:22:26.210 --> 03:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
of uh the number of sites we go do tests
 
03:22:26.220 --> 03:22:27.050 align:start position:0%
of uh the number of sites we go do tests
at

03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
um enforcement I just listed this for
 
03:22:30.889 --> 03:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
2019 I don't have the data for 2020 yet
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
but the important thing is we were able
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
to close out 77 enforcement actions all
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
without Federal over filing that's
 
03:22:40.010 --> 03:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
always our goal is to manage New
 
03:22:43.010 --> 03:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sources as a state agency uh
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and not to have EPA come into our state
 
03:22:48.050 --> 03:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
um asbestos management mentioned that in
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
addition to our normal demo rental
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
program we also have what we call the
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
Asbestos and schools program we have a
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
small Grant from EPA we generally do 30
 
03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
inspections every year at schools that
 
03:23:01.010 --> 03:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
have asbestos in them
 
03:23:02.210 --> 03:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
um you would you would think the rules
 
03:23:03.530 --> 03:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
would say get rid of the asbestos it
 
03:23:05.210 --> 03:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily say that says manage
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
it properly and that's what we make sure
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they're out there managing it
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
properly uh obviously for the safety of

03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
it just hit on a couple of my major uh
 
03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
mobile Source programs mentioned mobile
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
sources remain our largest source of
 
03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
emissions uh car emissions are actually
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh regulated at the federal level or in
 
03:23:29.090 --> 03:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
some instances California and other
 
03:23:31.490 --> 03:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
states may join what California does New
 
03:23:33.889 --> 03:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not do that most of the
 
03:23:36.889 --> 03:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
states around us are in fact Cal Lev or
 
03:23:39.050 --> 03:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
follow the California program New
 
03:23:41.330 --> 03:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have that
 
03:23:43.010 --> 03:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
um that's a matter obviously a policy
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
decision of the legislature uh OBD
 
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
that's everybody's favorite check engine
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
light program uh highly effective
 
03:23:51.710 --> 03:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
cost-effective program for ensuring that
 
03:23:53.450 --> 03:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
cars are running as cleanly as designed
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh all the department of safety runs
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we work in conjunction with them we
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
analyze the data we're responsible for
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
reporting that data to EPA to make sure
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
that that program's run properly Granite
 
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
State Clean Cities Coalition this is a
 
03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
great stakeholders group we have over
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
150 Partners run right here through our
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
our own Jessica Wilcox here at the air
 
03:24:16.670 --> 03:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
division uh the the purpose of this
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
group is to help facilitate and uh work
 
03:24:22.490 --> 03:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
our way off of uh fossil fuels in our
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
transportation sector so a really great
 
03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder uh group that we got going
 
03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
on Adair diesel emission reduction act
 
03:24:31.790 --> 03:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
this is a Federal grant we administer on
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
behalf of EPA uh we helped fund the
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
replacement of the older diesel
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
equipment uh we don't pay 100
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
replacement costs a lot of cases up to
 
03:24:44.809 --> 03:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
25 40 percent replacement costs this is
 
03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we passed through uh
 
03:24:49.250 --> 03:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
so this is a program that we've also
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
leveraged with the VW funding uh if
 
03:24:54.290 --> 03:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
people remember the VW emission Scandal
 
03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago that's actually run
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
through OSI office of strategic
 
03:25:01.010 --> 03:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
initiative but we we've kind of we're
 
03:25:03.050 --> 03:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
kind of contracted with them to be the
 
03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
technical arm so we do a lot of work for
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
them on behalf of ew we're currently
 
03:25:09.769 --> 03:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
working with them on a
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
RFP to come out soon on the build out of
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
EV charging along our major corridors I
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
think this is an area where New
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is lacking in comparison to
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
our neighbors so being able to spend
 
03:25:23.809 --> 03:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
that 15 of the VW money on that is going
 
03:25:25.250 --> 03:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
to be huge we also work with regional
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
planning commissions uh so next slide
 
03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:30.650 align:start position:0%
planning commissions uh so next slide
Mike

03:25:30.650 --> 03:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
I'll note again I started in 1988 so
 
03:25:35.690 --> 03:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
this is right after I started so I'll
 
03:25:37.010 --> 03:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
take all the credit here now just
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
kidding of course uh what we're seeing
 
03:25:41.330 --> 03:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
here is a 30-year emissions Trends
 
03:25:44.570 --> 03:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire the blue bar is
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide that goes actually with
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
the right side scale and all the other
 
03:25:51.650 --> 03:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
pollutants knocks sulfur dioxide PM 10
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
PM 2.5 and vocs the green the yellow the
 
03:25:57.229 --> 03:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
red the blue and the black and the gray
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
all go to the left side but what you're
 
03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
seeing here is Mike if you just click
 
03:26:00.779 --> 03:26:02.570 align:start position:0%
seeing here is Mike if you just click
once

03:26:02.570 --> 03:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:26:04.969 --> 03:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
yep so over 30 years we've seen anywhere
 
03:26:08.090 --> 03:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
from a 50 reduction to over a 95
 
03:26:10.250 --> 03:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
reduction in some of these pollutants
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
this is obviously the result of the uh
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know state laws obviously the result
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the clean act amendments in 1990 this
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
is good news for New Hampshire we're
 
03:26:22.370 --> 03:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
cleaning up our own emission sources
 
03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
we've done a great job one we still have
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
work to do
 
03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I'd point out on this
 
03:26:30.050 --> 03:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
this is just in-state emissions as we
 
03:26:32.570 --> 03:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
know uh pollution doesn't stop at the
 
03:26:34.729 --> 03:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
boundaries so uh we still have to deal
 
03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
with transported air pollution to the
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
state but this is obviously a very good
 
03:26:40.490 --> 03:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
trend for New Hampshire
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
so this is a rather unique way of
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
looking at well how good is the air
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
quality in New Hampshire and each one of
 
03:26:52.250 --> 03:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
these bars represents one of our
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire it also the
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
11th bar on the right yes there's not 11
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire the 11th bar
 
03:27:00.769 --> 03:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
on the right is our high elevation site
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be that Pacman ad knock
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
site and also Mount Washington the top
 
03:27:07.250 --> 03:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
of Mount Washington so green means good
 
03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
air quality yellow means moderate orange
 
03:27:12.610 --> 03:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
means unhealthy for sensitive gender
 
03:27:15.050 --> 03:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups that would be when
 
03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're violating the federal air quality
 
03:27:18.849 --> 03:27:18.859 align:start position:0%
standards so by and large New Hampshire
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
is we have pretty good air quality about
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 percent of our days uh some
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
days we're moderate very occasionally
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
with the USG if I put this up for 10
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
years ago you would see probably 10 15
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
20 days a year would be USG what you're
 
03:27:39.290 --> 03:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
seeing here for 2018 and 2019 is
 
03:27:42.290 --> 03:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
probably an average of five or less USG
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
days again that's a really good
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
indicator that we're making great
 
03:27:48.050 --> 03:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
progress but I will point out one thing
 
03:27:50.690 --> 03:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
though poor air quality is still in New
 
03:27:52.729 --> 03:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
England Connecticut still has some of
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
the worst ozone uh in the in the country
 
03:27:57.290 --> 03:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh Connecticut's not that far away from
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
us so we still need to maintain you do
 
03:28:05.710 --> 03:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
I've kind of already hit on this a
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
little bit but obviously our biggest
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
issue has been ozone it's a summertime
 
03:28:13.010 --> 03:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
pollutant we don't
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
our sources don't directly emit ozone
 
03:28:18.170 --> 03:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's formed in the atmosphere as a
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
combination of strong sunlight high
 
03:28:22.490 --> 03:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
temperatures uh nitrogen oxide emissions
 
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
and VOC emissions so a lot of what we
 
03:28:27.650 --> 03:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
get in New Hampshire is transported
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
um ozone pollution we tend to see it at
 
03:28:32.570 --> 03:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
Ohio elevations or along our seacoasts
 
03:28:34.969 --> 03:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
when we get the or come basically what
 
03:28:37.250 --> 03:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
comes out of Boston is a plume fine
 
03:28:39.530 --> 03:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
particular matter this is primarily a
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
wintertime pollutant the post a child of
 
03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
this is wood smoke in the Keen valley
 
03:28:46.969 --> 03:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
during the winter time and I have a
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
slide coming up on that so I won't spend
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
much time there one of the other big
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
things we're working on right now and
 
03:28:53.210 --> 03:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
again I still think fine particular
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
matter is going to be a bigger pollutant
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
of concern in the future as as science
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
gets caught up with health-based
 
03:29:01.849 --> 03:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
standards uh Regional Haze this is this
 
03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
is really not a health issue it's a
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
quality of life issue New Hampshire has
 
03:29:07.969 --> 03:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
what we call two class one areas in the
 
03:29:10.250 --> 03:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
state up in the White Mountains class
 
03:29:12.650 --> 03:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
one areas get special protections under
 
03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
the Fed Clean Air Act and the goal of
 
03:29:17.690 --> 03:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
the regional Haze program is to restore
 
03:29:20.929 --> 03:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
visibility in those areas to background
 
03:29:24.530 --> 03:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
Levels by 2064. I probably will not be
 
03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
the air director in 2064. I hate to say
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
it but uh we do know we're in our second
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
10-year planning phase of that right now
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
so we anticipate putting a new rule out
 
03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh very shortly by the end of this month
 
03:29:38.690 --> 03:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
hopefully our climate clean energy is
 
03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
obviously a a great concern to the
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
division clean energy of course our
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
interest there is uh energy is is
 
03:29:49.370 --> 03:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
invariably in a lot of cases a very
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
intensive pollution source so uh we see
 
03:29:55.130 --> 03:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
a clean a big link between climate air
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
pollution and clean energy
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
Mike next slide I won't spend a lot of
 
03:30:00.769 --> 03:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
time on this this is just for
 
03:30:02.809 --> 03:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
educational purposes and and we could
 
03:30:04.130 --> 03:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
certainly make these slides available
 
03:30:07.130 --> 03:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
but I mentioned ozone it's not directly
 
03:30:08.809 --> 03:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
admitted there's good old Zone in this
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
battle Zone though ozone way up above
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
the old ozone layer we've heard about
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
from the 80s that was falling apart that
 
03:30:17.330 --> 03:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
protects us from UV radiation from the
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
Sun that's good ozone battle zone is the
 
03:30:21.769 --> 03:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
ozone that forms near the ground that's
 
03:30:23.450 --> 03:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
commonly also a lot of people would call
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
that a smog and again it's been our
 
03:30:28.010 --> 03:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
largest regulatory driver here in the
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
state Mike next
 
03:30:34.370 --> 03:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
ozone obviously is a respiratory issue
 
03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
of respiratory concern asthma bronchitis
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
emphysina again it really impacts our
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
younger folks who have a much higher
 
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
respiratory rate than us adults and it
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
also significantly impacts our older
 
03:30:48.290 --> 03:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
population or anybody who deals with
 
03:30:48.300 --> 03:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
population or anybody who deals with
asthma

03:30:49.250 --> 03:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
asthma
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
um as I know as New Hampshire has some
 
03:30:53.330 --> 03:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the highest asthma rates in the
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
country from what I understand so
 
03:30:58.250 --> 03:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um next slide Mike
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things Congress did recognize
 
03:31:03.170 --> 03:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
when they passed the ozone uh the uh
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 is the
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
fact that no one stayed alone in the
 
03:31:09.550 --> 03:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
Northeast was going to be able to
 
03:31:12.650 --> 03:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
control ozone due to the fact that ozone
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
is such a regional pollutant so they
 
03:31:16.190 --> 03:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
created what's known as the ozone
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
transport region this is still a
 
03:31:21.170 --> 03:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
regulatory driver in New Hampshire even
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
though we are in attainment with the
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
ozone standard there are certain
 
03:31:27.469 --> 03:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
components of the Clean Air Act we still
 
03:31:29.690 --> 03:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
need to implement as if we were
 
03:31:31.610 --> 03:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
non-attainment and that that's literally
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
right in the Clean Air Act because of
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
this ozone transport region we need to
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't that our
 
03:31:40.130 --> 03:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
emissions are clean for our own purposes
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
but we can't impact downward States as
 
03:31:44.570 --> 03:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
well so
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh next slide Mike
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
another six another success story here
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
this just looks at ozone precursors in
 
03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this would be our vocs and
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
Knox emissions nitrogen oxide emissions
 
03:31:58.130 --> 03:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
my source category blue is points to us
 
03:32:00.769 --> 03:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
that's the Smoke Stack Industries red
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
being our area sources that would be you
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh mowing our Lawns and other things
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
or consumer products and things like
 
03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:09.290 align:start position:0%
or consumer products and things like
that

03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and then mobile sources our
 
03:32:13.010 --> 03:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
transportation sector uh we can see
 
03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
we've made tremendous strides here we're
 
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know a third of where we were just
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
in 1996 in terms of total emissions
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
um our smokestack Industries have very
 
03:32:25.610 --> 03:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
much cleaned up their emissions again
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that blue bar on the bottom uh
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation Still Remains our uh our
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
biggest source and and probably still
 
03:32:34.610 --> 03:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
the toughest uh issue to crack so next
 
03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
the long range story in Ozone as I
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned is good if you look at the
 
03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
slides a little complicated but if you
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
see the red checkered line that is the
 
03:32:47.690 --> 03:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
federal standard the eight hour standard
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
you can see you can see the impact of
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
EPA reviewing that every five years or
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
so as science has gotten better better
 
03:32:56.210 --> 03:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
understanding of impacts of ozone on
 
03:32:58.490 --> 03:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
people you can see how the standard has
 
03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
dropped a couple times since 1996 and
 
03:33:04.010 --> 03:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's the result of those periodic
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
reviews that EPA has done we're
 
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
currently at the 70 parts per billion on
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
the far right hand side
 
03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
prior to 1996 you might say well where's
 
03:33:15.290 --> 03:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
the red line the red line back then the
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
standard was on a one-hour basis rather
 
03:33:19.250 --> 03:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
than an eight-hour basis so it'd be a
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
little deceiving to put it on this same
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
chart of data
 
03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's very clear you can
 
03:33:28.010 --> 03:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
see the trend is clearly downward uh in
 
03:33:29.929 --> 03:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
our ozone numbers across the state so
 
03:33:32.090 --> 03:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
next slide Mike
 
03:33:34.370 --> 03:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
fine particular matter this is a PM 2.5
 
03:33:36.769 --> 03:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
again this is where I think the future
 
03:33:36.779 --> 03:33:38.389 align:start position:0%
again this is where I think the future
may

03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:33:41.090 --> 03:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
we may have some challenges on the left
 
03:33:43.130 --> 03:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
side of that is a human hair which is 70
 
03:33:45.710 --> 03:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
microns on the right side gives you an
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
idea of looking at a cross section of
 
03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
that here what PM 2.5 and pm10 looks
 
03:33:52.490 --> 03:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
like we are talking tiny tiny particles
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
of either liquids or small particular
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
matter these things are so small PM 2.5
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
it gets deep into our lungs
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's the issue I think
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
is the the depth to which it can
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
penetrate into the lungs and they can
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
also penetrate into the cardiovascular
 
03:34:11.690 --> 03:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
system so it's not just a lung issue
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's also a heart issue as well
 
03:34:13.800 --> 03:34:15.650 align:start position:0%
it's also a heart issue as well
Mike

03:34:15.650 --> 03:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
03:34:17.570 --> 03:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
and this just talks about some of the
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
impacts we can probably jump over that
 
03:34:19.620 --> 03:34:21.410 align:start position:0%
impacts we can probably jump over that
Mike

03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
p.m 10 PM 2.5 Trend in New Hampshire
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
again uh the red dotted line shows the
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
federal standard uh again you can see
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
the result of EPA revising the standard
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
in 2006 it went from 65 micrograms per
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
cubic meter to 35. that was a very
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
significant drop in 2006.
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
um again that's based on current health
 
03:34:45.530 --> 03:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
sciences I will be interested to see
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
where this number ends up in the future
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
um I think this is an area we may see
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
some downward trending of the standard
 
03:34:53.809 --> 03:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
in the future uh what whether that
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens in the next year or 10 years I
 
03:34:58.490 --> 03:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't know but science does seem to have
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
a strong indication that PM is is is an
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing health issue the line underneath
 
03:35:05.570 --> 03:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
kind of shows you where we've been as a
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
state this is primarily the Keen data
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit deceiving because
 
03:35:11.690 --> 03:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're always below that
 
03:35:11.700 --> 03:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're always below that
line

03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a disconnect in
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
the standard uh in my opinion the
 
03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:19.010 align:start position:0%
the standard uh in my opinion the
standard

03:35:19.010 --> 03:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
the 35 number there is based on a
 
03:35:25.490 --> 03:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
midnight to midnight reading that's the
 
03:35:27.530 --> 03:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
way the EPA Federal standard is set
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
midnight to midnight most of our high PM
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
nights in Keene happen over the Midnight
 
03:35:35.330 --> 03:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
Hour so literally what the standard does
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
is it takes one event and kind of
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
divises into two parts
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
if you had a rolling 24-hour number as
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
opposed to a midnight to midnight that
 
03:35:46.729 --> 03:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
blue line would be significantly higher
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
and possibly above the red line but
 
03:35:51.170 --> 03:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
technically we're in attainment
 
03:35:52.849 --> 03:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
um and we and we continue to see a
 
03:35:54.830 --> 03:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
downward Trend which is definitely a
 
03:35:57.889 --> 03:35:57.899 align:start position:0%
good thing so Mike next slide
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2008 2009 we were really
 
03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
concerned about the wood smoke situation
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
in Keene we were very close to the
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
standard we were close to going into
 
03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
non-attainment as you looked at that
 
03:36:13.010 --> 03:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
previous graph uh one of the things we
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
were able to do is facilitate over a
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
five-year period two wood stove
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
changeout programs the first one was in
 
03:36:22.729 --> 03:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
2009 we used some supplemental uh
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
environmental uh payment from A Fine
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
from American Electric Power a lawsuit
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire was involved in and
 
03:36:35.450 --> 03:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
we changed 86 old wood stoves in 2009 in
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the city proper of Keene with new EPA
 
03:36:40.969 --> 03:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
compliant wood stoves next slide Mike
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
that was at a cost of about a hundred
 
03:36:44.290 --> 03:36:44.300 align:start position:0%
and six thousand dollars
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
in uh 2015 2016 Bridgewater power funded
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
a four hundred thousand dollar wood
 
03:36:52.370 --> 03:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
stove changeout program under the New
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire renewable portfolio standards
 
03:36:56.929 --> 03:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
program uh this was a first of its kind
 
03:36:58.610 --> 03:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire funded under
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
that mechanism
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and then that that was Cheshire
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
county-wide not just Keene but we were
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
able to change out almost 300 wood
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
stoves we basically worked through the
 
03:37:11.330 --> 03:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
American Lung Association who ran the
 
03:37:14.090 --> 03:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
program for us but you can see we got
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars over 300
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
wood stoves changed out so next slide
 
03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:20.030 align:start position:0%
wood stoves changed out so next slide
Mike

03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
this is just what we used to see in
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
Keene on a regular basis
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a little hard to see on this
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
picture but if you look to the left and
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
the right you can see the mountains in
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
the background there
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and in the foreground what you do see
 
03:37:35.929 --> 03:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
is wood smoke actually trapped by a
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
thermal inversion uh within the Keen
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
Valley so this is one of the first times
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
we were able to get an actual picture of
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
it we could always monitor it but in
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
this day early in the morning one of our
 
03:37:47.570 --> 03:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
staff was out there and we were able to
 
03:37:50.090 --> 03:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
get this picture so that that is clearly
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
would smoke trapped within the valley
 
03:37:53.769 --> 03:37:53.779 align:start position:0%
region so
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
Regional Haze I mentioned before this is
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
this is the this is not a health program
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is a quality of life program
 
03:38:03.309 --> 03:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
um if you look on the right
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
you can see a good a good day in terms
 
03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
of visibility and you look on the right
 
03:38:10.990 --> 03:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
you see a very poor day of visibility
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not uh rain in there
 
03:38:18.290 --> 03:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's not collagen there that's fine
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
particles either sulfur particles or
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
nitrogen particles uh reflecting the
 
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
light uh in parent visibility this is
 
03:38:28.849 --> 03:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
the intent of uh of the regional Haze
 
03:38:31.849 --> 03:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
program again this goes out to 2064 but
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's a program we're implementing in New
 
03:38:37.010 --> 03:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a class one state and we
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
work with a much larger group called
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
main view which is the northeast states
 
03:38:44.210 --> 03:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
working together on this issue and we've
 
03:38:49.070 --> 03:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
had asks as far away as Texas for uh
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
companies to try to clear up their Smoke
 
03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
Stacks because of their potential impact
 
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
on Regional age of New Hampshire
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to yield the
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
floor to Mr Fitzgerald finally who you
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
all know very well and he's going to go
 
03:39:04.610 --> 03:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
over our Reggie program and talk a
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about uh where we are as a
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
division on pfas and then we're
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
certainly open to questions
 
03:39:13.370 --> 03:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
good thanks I appreciate it
 
03:39:15.170 --> 03:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
oh go for it okay I'm getting a little
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
echo in here but uh okay they're almost
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
set now
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
um good thank you Craig appreciate that
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the good news is we're near the
 
03:39:28.130 --> 03:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
end uh I only have a few slides left
 
03:39:31.729 --> 03:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
here so uh Reggie program you had some
 
03:39:33.410 --> 03:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
legislation on this this year and some
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
discussion unfortunately we weren't able
 
03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
to provide this information to you prior
 
03:39:41.450 --> 03:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
to so hopefully this will resonate uh
 
03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
the Reggie program uh is a an initiative
 
03:39:47.929 --> 03:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
of uh the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
 
03:39:50.650 --> 03:39:50.660 align:start position:0%
States uh back in the
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
2004-2005 time frame
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
um has continued since and uh and we're
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
actually the good news is that actually
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
expanding uh recently have added
 
03:40:03.889 --> 03:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
Virginia New Jersey dropped out for a
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
while and is now back and there are
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually there are some discussions
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
possible uh inclusion of Pennsylvania at
 
03:40:14.929 --> 03:40:14.939 align:start position:0%
some point down the road here so how
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
does Reggie work first
 
03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
you identify the sources that have to be
 
03:40:24.050 --> 03:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
covered in the Reggie program in the
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
states that are participating those are
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
25 megawatt or greater fossil fuel
 
03:40:31.849 --> 03:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
powered plants New Hampshire has a few a
 
03:40:36.290 --> 03:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
few such sources and so it became
 
03:40:37.610 --> 03:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
pertinent for us to be part of this
 
03:40:37.620 --> 03:40:39.130 align:start position:0%
pertinent for us to be part of this
program

03:40:39.130 --> 03:40:39.140 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
you determine their emissions we did
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
this back in as I say the 2004-2005 time
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
frame what their missions were and then
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
we set a cap
 
03:40:55.130 --> 03:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
and uh the then we issue allowances a
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
ton of CO2 is equivalent to an allowance
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
so therefore we issued allowances
 
03:41:03.170 --> 03:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what the current level
 
03:41:05.809 --> 03:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
emissions were and those allowances are
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
distributed by an auction it was
 
03:41:08.690 --> 03:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
determined that that's the most
 
03:41:10.610 --> 03:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
efficient economically efficient way to
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
to handle that we have a regional
 
03:41:14.330 --> 03:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
auction of those allowances can be
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
purchased by compliance entities and
 
03:41:17.160 --> 03:41:19.490 align:start position:0%
purchased by compliance entities and
then

03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:41:19.500 --> 03:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
then
um

03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the auction there is there are
 
03:41:24.729 --> 03:41:24.739 align:start position:0%
Provisions to uh
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that the cost of allowances don't
 
03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't go up too too much and there's a
 
03:41:36.190 --> 03:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
trigger provision and then
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh the compliance entities can purchase
 
03:41:44.210 --> 03:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
trade and Bank those allowances and then
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
at the point of compliance they the
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
sources must true up so however much
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
they've omitted and usually the
 
03:41:52.190 --> 03:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
compliance period is a three-year period
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
the sources have to determine how much
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
CO2 they've emitted report that and then
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
they have to uh surrender allowances
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that so the that makes
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
them purchase those allowances the
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
allowances as I say are distributed in
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
an auction and the auction revenues go
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
back to the states and the states use
 
03:42:15.250 --> 03:42:15.260 align:start position:0%
those in a variety of ways
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of it are moved to
 
03:42:21.250 --> 03:42:21.260 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in order to to
 
03:42:23.809 --> 03:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the
 
03:42:27.170 --> 03:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
electricity sector in New Hampshire we
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
as was indicated to you on the in a
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on the legislation on Reggie
 
03:42:36.530 --> 03:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
this year significant portion of the the
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire revenues are refunded back
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
to Consumers and to uh corporations to
 
03:42:46.750 --> 03:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
the companies and Commercial entities
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
about one dollar for every ton of
 
03:42:50.279 --> 03:42:51.710 align:start position:0%
about one dollar for every ton of
allowance

03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
03:42:54.410 --> 03:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
um is allocated to Energy Efficiency
 
03:42:56.809 --> 03:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
programs here allowances currently
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
trading uh the auction 51 for Reggie was
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
just held yesterday and allowance is
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
traded at about seven dollars and sixty
 
03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:05.710 align:start position:0%
traded at about seven dollars and sixty
cents

03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
cents
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire's case we use one
 
03:43:10.729 --> 03:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
dollar of that seven dollars to go into
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
our Energy Efficiency programs and the
 
03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
remainder is rebated to Consumers
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
for their own benefit so
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that's basically how the program
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
works and also just wanted to very
 
03:43:28.490 --> 03:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
briefly touch on uh the pfas issue many
 
03:43:30.190 --> 03:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
of you have heard of
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
significant prefast contamination in
 
03:43:34.490 --> 03:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire as a result of
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
some industrial emissions down there
 
03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
that it's gone on for many many years
 
03:43:43.969 --> 03:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
back in in 2018 we worked with this
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee and numerous other committees
 
03:43:49.969 --> 03:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
and and legislators to get SB 309 passed
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
SB 309 requires us to regulate emission
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas that have the potential
 
03:44:00.290 --> 03:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
to contaminate groundwater
 
03:44:02.330 --> 03:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and it requires require required us
 
03:44:06.769 --> 03:44:06.779 align:start position:0%
to put a uh a permit in place excuse me
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
and require controls from One Source in
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the saint gobain plant
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
down in Merrimack
 
03:44:14.990 --> 03:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
many of you may have heard
 
03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
um there's been some Rumblings recently
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh relative to that situation and Des
 
03:44:26.450 --> 03:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
has filed suit to ensure compliance and
 
03:44:28.849 --> 03:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
is working closely with the facility to
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that they move as expeditiously
 
03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
03:44:36.050 --> 03:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
so uh that bill also required us to
 
03:44:38.410 --> 03:44:38.420 align:start position:0%
establish some groundwater
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
drinking water mcls and we're called
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
agqs ambient groundwater quality
 
03:44:47.090 --> 03:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
standards for 4p fast compounds I will
 
03:44:49.729 --> 03:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
not uh go over those you can read them
 
03:44:53.210 --> 03:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
on your own and we have established
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
those standards and the standards are
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
established per RSA 485 16e which was
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
Again part of Senate bill 309.
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh Des also is required to develop a
 
03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
plan for surface water quality standards
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
by January 1st 2020
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and we also received some general
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
funds as Craig mentioned
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
um we've received an increase in our
 
03:45:21.889 --> 03:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
general fund allocations to help hire a
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
risk assessor and a toxicologist to
 
03:45:26.090 --> 03:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
conduct studies and other work to
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
support development of those standards
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
and also for Des
 
03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
um is if we the legislation required us
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
to update the every five years our
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards
 
03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
many of which we haven't had staff and
 
03:45:44.570 --> 03:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh under the resources to update and
 
03:45:47.330 --> 03:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
have not been revised since back in the
 
03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
late 80s and early 90s so that's a task
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
that we're currently working on and
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're very pleased with the staff that
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
we've been able to hire to uh to do that
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
work so um and we're making we're making
 
03:46:01.490 --> 03:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
significant progress we should have that
 
03:46:05.929 --> 03:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
done by the deadline in 2023 it was
 
03:46:05.939 --> 03:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
done by the deadline in 2023 it was
established

03:46:07.190 --> 03:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
established
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh again
 
03:46:11.330 --> 03:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
um we did Issue a permit for single Bain
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh a year ago in February
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
they requested a variance to that they
 
03:46:21.050 --> 03:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
cited covid issues and um uh some other
 
03:46:24.590 --> 03:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
con issues on uh causing them delays in
 
03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:26.750 align:start position:0%
con issues on uh causing them delays in
construction

03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we denied that variance uh back last
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
summer and um the permit uh was
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
subsequently appealed by the town of
 
03:46:37.370 --> 03:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and uh those controls were
 
03:46:38.809 --> 03:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
still required the permit's still in
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
effect and they were required to be
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
installed back in February
 
03:46:45.410 --> 03:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
and again we are working with the source
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
to um to ensure that they do so
 
03:46:49.450 --> 03:46:49.460 align:start position:0%
expeditiously they have not met the
 
03:46:52.729 --> 03:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
permit requirement but they are they are
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
working and and we're discussing with
 
03:46:56.990 --> 03:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
them how we're going to respond to their
 
03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
failure to meet the that requirement
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
um we have also identified other
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that need stack testing and
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
to date we have not identified any other
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
facilities that we think would be
 
03:47:10.890 --> 03:47:10.900 align:start position:0%
subject to this legislation
 
03:47:10.900 --> 03:47:12.110 align:start position:0%
subject to this legislation
[Music]

03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
um there's currently an LSR over in the
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
Senate that would ban incineration of
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
pfast it's very widely the term pfas and
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
incineration is very broadly
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
defined we've expressed some significant
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about that legislation and how
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
it might interfere with the application
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
of RSA 125 c10e and we are currently
 
03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
discussing that with the with the
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
sponsors so hopefully we can get that
 
03:47:41.210 --> 03:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
corrected before it comes up across over
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
to the house and get it to a point that
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
would not interfere with these the
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
situation that we're experiencing down
 
03:47:52.370 --> 03:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:54.530 --> 03:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
um so again uh I told you we would be
 
03:47:54.540 --> 03:47:55.849 align:start position:0%
um so again uh I told you we would be
brief

03:47:55.849 --> 03:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
brief
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
um uh director Wright and I are
 
03:48:00.050 --> 03:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
certainly available at any point in time
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
as Craig mentioned to you he comes out
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the permitting side I come from the
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
technical sources climate energy side
 
03:48:09.889 --> 03:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
and um uh so between the two of us we
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
might be able to uh Cobble together one
 
03:48:15.290 --> 03:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
good answer to a question and uh if not
 
03:48:17.929 --> 03:48:17.939 align:start position:0%
we have great staff and I also have uh
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
Catherine beam uh here with us today
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
Catherine is in charge of our ship
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
planning and uh used to be in permitting
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
she's been very involved and is an
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually nationally renowned expert on
 
03:48:30.769 --> 03:48:30.779 align:start position:0%
pfas emissions so if you have any
 
03:48:32.929 --> 03:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
questions in that Arena Catherine is
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
available and also Rebecca oler many of
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
you know Becky um as well Becky's in
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
charge of our climate energy programs
 
03:48:43.610 --> 03:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh so if there are questions with
 
03:48:46.849 --> 03:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
regards to our reference in those Arenas
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
um I may if again if you stump Craig and
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
I we uh we may ask them to jump in but
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
with that um I think we're uh we're
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
finished Mr chairman and we'd be happy
 
03:48:59.570 --> 03:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
to uh to take questions from you or the
 
03:49:00.889 --> 03:49:00.899 align:start position:0%
committee and we thank you for the
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to share our
 
03:49:07.250 --> 03:49:07.260 align:start position:0%

this thing do you have any idea what's
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.070 --> 03:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay is the echo gone now
 
03:51:01.080 --> 03:51:02.210 align:start position:0%
okay is the echo gone now
yeah

03:51:02.210 --> 03:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I muted you Mr Fitzgerald I
 
03:51:07.490 --> 03:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
think the echo is coming from you uh so
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let people ask questions
 
03:51:11.330 --> 03:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then I'll turn you back on so or
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
allow you to turn yourself back on so
 
03:51:15.530 --> 03:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
you can answer so the first questioner
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
is representative oxen
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much a quick question
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
about electric vehicles and mobile
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
sources in general uh there was a a
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
statement made I Believe by uh Mr Wright
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
about the importance of reducing
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
pollution in for mobile sources being a
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult nut to crack
 
03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
um do you see in in the coming years of
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
advantages to moving to electric
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh We've we've had the opinion
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
expressed here in committee that this is
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
something of a fad
 
03:51:56.870 --> 03:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh I don't I don't think it's a fad I
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
Think electric vehicle is a common uh
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it in my mind uh
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
look at the way some of the main the
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
lodge manufacturers are talking I think
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
Volvo just announced they won't sell a
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
non-electric car in 20 past 20 30. um I
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
think this is the transition we're
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
coming to I think you're seeing a lot of
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
the big automakers invest in this I
 
03:52:19.190 --> 03:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
think we got to get over the buyer
 
03:52:22.010 --> 03:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
concern issue we need to build the
 
03:52:24.889 --> 03:52:24.899 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh to let people feel
 
03:52:27.290 --> 03:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable buying electric vehicles
 
03:52:28.729 --> 03:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
most people who have electric vehicle
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
charge at home so they can take care of
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
their own charging it's when they're on
 
03:52:33.410 --> 03:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
the road traveling that they have
 
03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
concerns so we need to build out the
 
03:52:37.729 --> 03:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
infrastructure along our travel ways and
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
I wish I had the map I know Becky has a
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
map where it shows uh fast charges in
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire compared to our states
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
around us and we almost look like a
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
donut hole we are falling behind on
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
building the infrastructure and I'm I am
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
particularly excited about uh the um us
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
the governor agreeing with OSI to spend
 
03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
the 15 of the VW money on uh
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for electric vehicles I
 
03:53:08.570 --> 03:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
think that's a start uh I don't think
 
03:53:10.370 --> 03:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's the end game I think we need to
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
invest more so where the revenue comes
 
03:53:15.050 --> 03:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
for that that's the big question so
 
03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
Becky or Mike I don't know if you want
 
03:53:22.030 --> 03:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
apparently not so I'll ask a follow-up
 
03:53:27.410 --> 03:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
question to that question do you think
 
03:53:27.420 --> 03:53:28.790 align:start position:0%
question to that question do you think
that

03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
building charging infrastructure would
 
03:53:35.690 --> 03:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
be better accomplished by private
 
03:53:35.700 --> 03:53:36.830 align:start position:0%
be better accomplished by private
companies

03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
who can make a profit from
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
putting together those stations rather
 
03:53:44.929 --> 03:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
than perhaps the government be involved
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
I would say probably anytime you could
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
leverage private funding that's
 
03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
obviously a good thing
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I think like the VW funding I think
 
03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is getting
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
something off the ground uh building
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
some infrastructure but then third
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
parties running those so they would
 
03:54:01.610 --> 03:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh hopefully build a model
 
03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
where they could uh they could make a
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
profit off it and expand the
 
03:54:07.190 --> 03:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure themselves I mean you got
 
03:54:09.410 --> 03:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
to start somewhere though
 
03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsitch it's
 
03:54:11.460 --> 03:54:14.450 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsitch it's
recognized

03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:54:17.160 --> 03:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
um

03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
we've got actually two questions I think
 
03:54:25.250 --> 03:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
um just as a uh um in the way of
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
explanation uh the the Reggie auction of
 
03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:30.790 align:start position:0%
explanation uh the the Reggie auction of
um

03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm currently involved with selling
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
my solar wrecks to an aggregator and the
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
price that I'm getting for my Rex is um
 
03:54:51.410 --> 03:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
over thirty dollars or a wreck and you
 
03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that right now in New
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we're getting something
 
03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
like 7.50
 
03:55:00.769 --> 03:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
can you explain the difference of where
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
that big discrepancy comes from Mike do
 
03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
you want to explain that or I could
 
03:55:08.330 --> 03:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.340 --> 03:55:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah you're speaking uh actually of
 
03:55:13.370 --> 03:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
two different programs renewal renewable
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
energy certificates are
 
03:55:17.689 --> 03:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
um the results from the renewable
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
um they are certificates that are issued
 
03:55:23.870 --> 03:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
for each hour of Renewable Power that is
 
03:55:26.450 --> 03:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
generated in in the state from solar
 
03:55:29.929 --> 03:55:29.939 align:start position:0%
wind various uh types of entities uh
 
03:55:32.689 --> 03:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
Reggie allowances are a different
 
03:55:32.699 --> 03:55:33.429 align:start position:0%
Reggie allowances are a different
um

03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:37.729 --> 03:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh entity uh Reggie allowance is the
 
03:55:39.530 --> 03:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
equivalent of one
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
um ton of CO2 emissions from a power
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
plant and so they're just two completely
 
03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
different entities Reggie allowances
 
03:55:49.849 --> 03:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
currently traded around seven dollars
 
03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
and eighty cents yeah the rec Market is
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
vastly different but their their apples
 
03:55:56.510 --> 03:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
and oranges
 
03:55:59.689 --> 03:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you a follow-up Mr chair oh
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh also I'm curious to know if you have
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
any any um background information or
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
insight into the possibility of um
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
 
03:56:14.090 --> 03:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and their infrastructure in the
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
future I know that California already
 
03:56:19.370 --> 03:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
has that and uh Toyota it has been
 
03:56:21.530 --> 03:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
selling a vehicle there for at least
 
03:56:23.090 --> 03:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
um is there any any interest in that
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
03:56:30.530 --> 03:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman if I could uh Elevate if
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
you could Elevate Becky oler uh and
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
Catherine beam
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
um to speaking rules I'd like to have
 
03:56:40.370 --> 03:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
Becky address that if possible
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.450 --> 03:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay Becky Oller and Kathy beam are now
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
do a lot of talk
 
03:56:55.729 --> 03:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me yes yes okay
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Becky older the Des uh so in
 
03:57:01.849 --> 03:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
response to that we I think that there
 
03:57:03.650 --> 03:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
is uh definitely going to be a future
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
for the fuel cell vehicles but probably
 
03:57:08.809 --> 03:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
more likely in the heavy duty sector uh
 
03:57:11.450 --> 03:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
where the the long distance travel is
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
um hampered by having to have so many
 
03:57:16.610 --> 03:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
batteries on board we are seeing a lot
 
03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
of work in both Connecticut and
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut in particular
 
03:57:22.670 --> 03:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
where they actually have uh companies
 
03:57:24.290 --> 03:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
that are developing the hydrogen fuel
 
03:57:25.729 --> 03:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
cell tanks
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so you can imagine it's it's pretty
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
hard you know hydrogen is the smallest
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
atom it's pretty hard to keep it
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
contained so so developing the
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate tanks for that is uh has
 
03:57:37.610 --> 03:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
been quite a science in and of itself
 
03:57:40.010 --> 03:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
but a lot of work going on in New
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
England particularly in Massachusetts
 
03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut Connecticut
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:46.729 --> 03:57:46.739 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman also if I could just very
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
quickly add there may be some question
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
as to why Des is concerned with with
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and energy issues and
 
03:57:58.130 --> 03:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
I think just from an overall perspective
 
03:58:01.490 --> 03:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh we consider electricity to be a very
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
significant source of pollution but also
 
03:58:05.530 --> 03:58:05.540 align:start position:0%
it's a significant answer because
 
03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
changing Vehicles over to
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
electrification even though that
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
electricity comes from power plants
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're extremely more efficient and
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
they use significantly less energy and
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh as the New England grid and the
 
03:58:21.290 --> 03:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
National Grid gets cleaner and cleaner
 
03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
over time through the elimination of of
 
03:58:27.290 --> 03:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
coal uh you know significant use of
 
03:58:29.929 --> 03:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
natural gas right now and introduction
 
03:58:33.530 --> 03:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
of more Renewables as time goes on as
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
that grid cleans up we actually see much
 
03:58:38.330 --> 03:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced emissions as a
 
03:58:41.090 --> 03:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
result of the electric vehicles electric
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
heat pumps in homes Etc so it seems kind
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
of uh incongruous to say well we want to
 
03:58:49.490 --> 03:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
go move to more electricity and and then
 
03:58:51.290 --> 03:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
talk about needing to reduce emissions
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
from a lectures from the electric sector
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
but they do go hand in hand and when we
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
see a significant reduction and uh in
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
both of those trends for electric uh
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
Heating and Cooling and vehicle usage
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
if if I could just add on to that one
 
03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
little bit it the other issue or the
 
03:59:15.050 --> 03:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
other sort of benefit of the vehicles
 
03:59:16.849 --> 03:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
using the electric grid is that as Mike
 
03:59:19.130 --> 03:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
noted about 80 of charging typically
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
happens at home and most of that
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
charging is happening overnight so
 
03:59:26.150 --> 03:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're utilizing an existing
 
03:59:29.570 --> 03:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to at a time when it's
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
not being used and there is spare energy
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
available and that way you are spreading
 
03:59:36.290 --> 03:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
the cost of all of that infrastructure
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be there to meet the peak
 
03:59:40.130 --> 03:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
demands during the daytime hours it's
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
getting used and paid for overnight
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
right now it's just sitting there not
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
being used and nobody you know no income
 
03:59:49.010 --> 03:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
coming in from it so this the by
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
spreading out electric use over the the
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle sector as well it can
 
03:59:58.610 --> 03:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative McGee is
 
04:00:03.530 --> 04:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:00:05.570 --> 04:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:00:07.969 --> 04:00:07.979 align:start position:0%
um my question I think would also go to
 
04:00:10.370 --> 04:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
Becky um I was on the admissions
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
commission uh this past year and
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
um Chris skoglund did he used I think it
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
was your slide 14 that showed the
 
04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
downward trajectory for emissions over
 
04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
time and it's very impressive trajectory
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
but one of the points that he made to
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
our group was that 2021 was the year
 
04:00:33.790 --> 04:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
where that that lovely trajectory of us
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
lowering our emissions especially
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
specifically we're talking CO2 on that
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
particular uh Commission
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
that it would it would
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
um Flatline in 2021 so I wondered if you
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
could speak about that what he said was
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
it would Flatline without policy changes
 
04:00:54.050 --> 04:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
so basically if we stay with the
 
04:00:55.610 --> 04:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
existing policies that we currently have
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
as a state he was suggesting that that
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
trajectory that we were enjoying would
 
04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
not continue going downward yeah thanks
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'll address that representative McGee
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:08.150 --> 04:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and just uh for information again the
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
slide that we showed today was uh for
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
our conventional air pollutant standards
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
um that may have been Co on there not
 
04:01:15.120 --> 04:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
um that may have been Co on there not
CO2

04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
CO2
 
04:01:19.490 --> 04:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but again uh you're correct uh Chris
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
did do a presentation for the commission
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
I was on part of the commission as well
 
04:01:22.920 --> 04:01:24.530 align:start position:0%
I was on part of the commission as well
and

04:01:24.530 --> 04:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
um uh we do see that uh New Hampshire uh
 
04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
emissions and uh and Regional emissions
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
have declined uh for several years uh as
 
04:01:39.650 --> 04:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
a result of significant changes in in uh
 
04:01:42.050 --> 04:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
electricity generation and vehicle
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
reduction vehicle pollution reduction
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
but um the we will Plateau we do expect
 
04:01:49.570 --> 04:01:49.580 align:start position:0%
that those
 
04:01:51.650 --> 04:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
reductions uh we've gotten what we're
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
going to get now and we will Plateau in
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
terms of our levels of emissions uh over
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
the next 20 to 30 years
 
04:02:02.689 --> 04:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
um uh absent other policies we've
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
implemented Reggie the RPS
 
04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
um again we're getting cleaner Vehicles
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
we're seeing lower sea level missions
 
04:02:11.769 --> 04:02:11.779 align:start position:0%
from power plants more Renewables Etc
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
but those policies are in place and
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
they've had their effect now and so
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to kind of stay flat at this
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
point absent other other programs and
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
and reduction uh measures that can be
 
04:02:28.130 --> 04:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
taken both by our state and on a
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you can I have a follow-up
 
04:02:35.809 --> 04:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up I I guess my question would be
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is my second term on science
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
technology and energy so I'm still very
 
04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
much a newbie but my question would be
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's great that you come and show us
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
your work and that we try to understand
 
04:02:48.650 --> 04:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
how to integrate that into our work but
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what the right balance is
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
between the state agencies and the
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
policy makers in terms of trying to
 
04:02:55.020 --> 04:02:56.110 align:start position:0%
policy makers in terms of trying to
decide

04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
decide
 
04:02:58.610 --> 04:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
what would be the valuable policies to
 
04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
put in place because I feel like we're
 
04:03:03.170 --> 04:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
kind of just putting pins in a you know
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't seem to be connected
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
what you guys are saying and what we end
 
04:03:11.090 --> 04:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
up doing I Wonder has there ever been
 
04:03:13.010 --> 04:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
um an interplay between the two in terms
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
of trying to come up with the most
 
04:03:18.290 --> 04:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
efficient ways for us to meet the goals
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
well I'll take a crack at that and Craig
 
04:03:22.849 --> 04:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
might want to might want to jump in too
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
but um I think probably the place where
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
there was the most significant interplay
 
04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
was back in 2009 when we developed the
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
state's climate action plan and that was
 
04:03:36.349 --> 04:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
the result of a 29-member bipartisan
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission that was appointed by the
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
governor at the time
 
04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
and that plan came up with
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
um a wide number of recommendations that
 
04:03:44.939 --> 04:03:46.130 align:start position:0%
um a wide number of recommendations that
were

04:03:46.130 --> 04:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it was a consensus
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
plan and there was significant we
 
04:03:54.889 --> 04:03:54.899 align:start position:0%
received input from all across the state
 
04:03:56.809 --> 04:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
we held public hearings all across the
 
04:03:58.969 --> 04:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
state that was a two-year process
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
and um probably need some updating but
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's still actually a pretty good
 
04:04:05.090 --> 04:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
document and um there were numerous
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislators involved in that as well as
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
academics industrial folks
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
um and so on and so um there was a broad
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
representation and and uh I think they
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
came to you know some agreement on to on
 
04:04:21.729 --> 04:04:21.739 align:start position:0%
what goals New Hampshire ought to adopt
 
04:04:24.769 --> 04:04:24.779 align:start position:0%
and uh what policies
 
04:04:28.490 --> 04:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
um we we should be considering and that
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
plan is uh is still out there it's
 
04:04:33.290 --> 04:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
available on our website uh but the the
 
04:04:36.410 --> 04:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
policy action is uh we we that's sort of
 
04:04:40.729 --> 04:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
in in your court and and we uh we can
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
only do what
 
04:04:46.250 --> 04:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
um the legislative you know what if
 
04:04:48.290 --> 04:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
um actions of the legislature gives us
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
the authority to uh to take um in
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
statute and uh and where we do those but
 
04:04:57.290 --> 04:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
um we certainly think the climate plan
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
would be a good place to start and you
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
know maybe dust it off and and look uh
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
look again but it was a it was a pretty
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
pretty robust process that produced that
 
04:05:09.120 --> 04:05:09.889 align:start position:0%
pretty robust process that produced that
plan

04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:05:11.929 --> 04:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
yeah and Mike I think I would just add I
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
think kind of our role and goal has been
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
how do we help facilitate this
 
04:05:15.779 --> 04:05:17.150 align:start position:0%
how do we help facilitate this
discussion

04:05:17.150 --> 04:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know we view ourselves as a
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
resource uh for the legislature to get
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
information from to fact check things
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
provide information to
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
um these are not easy decisions to make
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
though in terms of where do you go next
 
04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
how do you get the next round of
 
04:05:31.380 --> 04:05:32.809 align:start position:0%
how do you get the next round of
reductions

04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know regulating a power plant how
 
04:05:36.530 --> 04:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
plants are used to being regulated
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
getting Reggie in it I'm not going to
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
say it was easy but they've built that
 
04:05:43.130 --> 04:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
into their operations right they
 
04:05:46.250 --> 04:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
understand Reggie they it's it's easier
 
04:05:47.870 --> 04:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
to regulate a power plant than it is to
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
regulate URI and when we start talking
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
about people driving habits electric
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles that gets much more personal
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I think the choices get harder to
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
make so we view ourselves as how can we
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
help you guys make those smart policy
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
okay next step is representative
 
04:06:09.660 --> 04:06:14.570 align:start position:0%
okay next step is representative
Pimentel

04:06:14.570 --> 04:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I got a question
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
for uh Mr Wright
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
um you uh mentioned that
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
one of the up-and-coming things that's
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to become a bigger issue is a
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
particulate matter
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious because a lot of what
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing this term is
 
04:06:42.410 --> 04:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
involving uh low-grade
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
um wood products and how they're being
 
04:06:50.050 --> 04:06:50.060 align:start position:0%
used for for pellets and Heating
 
04:06:52.610 --> 04:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
stoves and all this sort of thing and
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
and of course our biomass plants and I'm
 
04:06:55.560 --> 04:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
and of course our biomass plants and I'm
curious

04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
curious
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
if those things are an issue as far as
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
particulate matter or are we just
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:07:07.849 --> 04:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
Your Average
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
basic wood stove
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
I I I first I would couch with we have a
 
04:07:14.929 --> 04:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
saying in the department I am live right
 
04:07:17.170 --> 04:07:17.180 align:start position:0%
yep uh what is good
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
as a department we support the
 
04:07:21.170 --> 04:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
combustion of wood
 
04:07:21.180 --> 04:07:22.250 align:start position:0%
combustion of wood
um

04:07:22.250 --> 04:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
we need I think if we want healthy
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
forests we need to have healthy
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh actions going on in our forest we
 
04:07:33.170 --> 04:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
need to have proper logging done enough
 
04:07:35.689 --> 04:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
for us to maintain our forests
 
04:07:38.570 --> 04:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the biomass plants the large plants
 
04:07:40.849 --> 04:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
have very significant levels of controls
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
we may have just lost Craig I I think I
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
can probably complete his thought that
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
um uh the activities we
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
again we we believe that there's a place
 
04:08:05.330 --> 04:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
for combustion of wood it needs
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
appropriate controls and
 
04:08:12.530 --> 04:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
um we we see uh the the issue that we
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
see coming is that the PM standard as
 
04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
you saw on our charts that standard is
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
currently at 35. we see probably going
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a significant
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
reduction in that standard coming
 
04:08:27.550 --> 04:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
sometime in the next uh oh there's Craig
 
04:08:29.570 --> 04:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know what happened there sorry
 
04:08:31.370 --> 04:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
about that go ahead Mike you were
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
continuing on no I I was just saying
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
that we see see uh probably a reduction
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the EPA standard coming in the future
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
and that's going to make
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
um the the regulation and the the
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
technology development for new new wood
 
04:08:51.290 --> 04:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
stoves that are cleaner better
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
controlled that sort of thing
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the more all the more important so
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
um we we do see a sort of you know
 
04:09:06.530 --> 04:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
um combined role of of economy uh Forest
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
management uh and we work very closely
 
04:09:11.450 --> 04:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
um the state Forester and and
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that group in in uh
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
coming up with the appropriate measures
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
um here
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
um but there's there's also a
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
significant climate role from uh the
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint of maintaining forests the
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
forests are carbon sink and uh if we're
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
not able to uh properly maintain our
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
forest and we start losing forested
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
areas because the wood is not being
 
04:09:39.530 --> 04:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
harvested appropriately and there's not
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
not appropriate markets so it all plays
 
04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:43.309 align:start position:0%
not appropriate markets so it all plays
together

04:09:43.309 --> 04:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:09:45.170 --> 04:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
um but I think Craig is right there's
 
04:09:46.610 --> 04:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be a lot of
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
discussion in this arena in the next uh
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
next couple of years we have
 
04:09:52.849 --> 04:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
kind of you know
 
04:09:55.969 --> 04:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
the old Pogo line we've seen the enemy
 
04:09:58.969 --> 04:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
and he is us and so we we've got to
 
04:10:00.170 --> 04:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
figure out how to deal with these
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
emissions I I figure out a minimum EPA
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
is going to reevaluate the midnight to
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
midnight part of the standard
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
um I know that sounds like technical
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
jargon but really what again what that
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
does is it doesn't capture a full event
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
our lungs don't reset at midnight so you
 
04:10:19.010 --> 04:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
really need to look at a 24-hour rolling
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
standard I think if you do that that's
 
04:10:23.090 --> 04:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
the first thing EPA is going to be
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
looking at in the near future they did
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
just re-promagate the standards right at
 
04:10:30.530 --> 04:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
the end of the last Administration
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll be interested to see what the
 
04:10:33.530 --> 04:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
new Administration does whether they
 
04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
pick it up
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
sooner or whether they wait the five
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's follow-up
 
04:10:45.889 --> 04:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
04:10:45.899 --> 04:10:47.150 align:start position:0%
chairman so
um

04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
is is your concern as far as the the
 
04:10:53.150 --> 04:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
particulate matter
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
not at the Industrial Level but really
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the wood stove is that
 
04:11:02.090 --> 04:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
is that how I can interpret what you're
 
04:11:02.100 --> 04:11:03.010 align:start position:0%
is that how I can interpret what you're
saying

04:11:03.010 --> 04:11:03.020 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
that besides transport which is we've
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
had some events for example I'm a member
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Memorial Day uh probably five or six
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
years ago there were Western fires and
 
04:11:16.130 --> 04:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
they literally put smoke into New
 
04:11:16.140 --> 04:11:16.969 align:start position:0%
they literally put smoke into New
Hampshire

04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do about that
 
04:11:18.960 --> 04:11:20.330 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do about that
obviously

04:11:20.330 --> 04:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so that type of event you know that's
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
Forest management out west that's
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do about that
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um generally what we've seen like in the
 
04:11:32.570 --> 04:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
Keene area is a very localized impact uh
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
from home heating
 
04:11:36.410 --> 04:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
um that's why we went and were able to
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
successfully do those two wood stove
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
changeout programs
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
um like I said what is good it's
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
renewable it's it's
 
04:11:46.250 --> 04:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's a local resource the money stays in
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the local economy it doesn't immediately
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
leave the state when you you know you
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
buy a gallon of gasoline that money's
 
04:11:52.849 --> 04:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
gone small bit goes back to your
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
retailer but the rest of that money has
 
04:11:56.210 --> 04:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
gone out of state you know at least wood
 
04:11:58.010 --> 04:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
is local and I think that's a good thing
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
so we certainly don't want to be talking
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
about banning home wood burning or
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
anything like that we just want it done
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
as best and as efficiently as cleanly as
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
possible that's what we need to have in
 
04:12:08.450 --> 04:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
place we need to continue to work with
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
EPA and push EPA on making sure they
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
update those standards for those devices
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
could I have one more follow-up uh Mr
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
chairman to our subject uh
 
04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
the the whole idea of of the of you
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
replacing the wood stoves I'm just
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
really curious I I assume there must be
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
some studies on the particulate matter
 
04:12:35.170 --> 04:12:35.180 align:start position:0%
in a standard
 
04:12:38.150 --> 04:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
wood stove with no catalytic converter
 
04:12:42.370 --> 04:12:42.380 align:start position:0%
no uh uh inducing fan whatever
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh do you know what the difference is in
 
04:12:49.130 --> 04:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
in real numbers we actually we have a
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
chart that we can make available to the
 
04:12:51.889 --> 04:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
committee that talks about different
 
04:12:53.929 --> 04:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
types of heating devices and we can
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
certainly provide that to the committee
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
um but suffice it to say a device
 
04:13:00.769 --> 04:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
meeting new standards uh probably an
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude cleaner than devices
 
04:13:07.370 --> 04:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
that were certified back in 1988.
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
one of the key issues with wood stoves
 
04:13:09.239 --> 04:13:10.130 align:start position:0%
one of the key issues with wood stoves
is

04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
as you well know they last they
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
generally last forever you know and the
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
the prior standard that most of the wood
 
04:13:20.090 --> 04:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
stoves that are operating today uh was
 
04:13:23.870 --> 04:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
that standard was issued in 1998 EPA
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
developed a new standard that took
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
effect in 2016 there's been some fits
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
and starts with its application and so
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
on but
 
04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
um it's just like heavy duty trucks uh
 
04:13:36.650 --> 04:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know they may last 20 or 30 years so
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
when you buy one you're stuck with it
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
for a long time and so that's why we
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
went with the wood stove replacement was
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
we were replacing older wood stoves with
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
newer ones that had more more modern
 
04:13:47.040 --> 04:13:48.349 align:start position:0%
newer ones that had more more modern
technology

04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:13:50.570 --> 04:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add one closing point in
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
this I have no interest in regulating on
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
a house by house basis that's not what
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
the year division is all about
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
um we want to work with EPA and we want
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
to work with the manufacturers so that
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
the devices that are bought are the
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
cleanest devices available
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about being the wood
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
stove Felicia
 
04:14:11.150 --> 04:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't expect that but thank you very
 
04:14:11.160 --> 04:14:13.450 align:start position:0%
I didn't expect that but thank you very
much

04:14:13.450 --> 04:14:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's recognized
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:22.010 --> 04:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm also curious uh Mr Wright about
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
your your emphasis on
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
the particulate matter issue
 
04:14:28.680 --> 04:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
the particulate matter issue
[Music]

04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:29.279 --> 04:14:29.929 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:33.530 --> 04:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
is this is your concern mainly drewn
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
because you think there'll be many more
 
04:14:39.070 --> 04:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
people using wood burning stoves or or
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
because obviously um uh you know we we
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a certain population right now
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
that's using it uh you're regulating it
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
right now uh are your concerns that the
 
04:14:53.210 --> 04:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
standards will become more strict or
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
that more people will use wood and of
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
course there's there's another issue
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's not directly related that I have
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
encountered in in my uh very scientific
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
conferences and that is that
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are able to make smaller
 
04:15:11.929 --> 04:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
and smaller particles now that can be a
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
health hazard when they get into the
 
04:15:13.680 --> 04:15:14.410 align:start position:0%
health hazard when they get into the
body

04:15:14.410 --> 04:15:14.420 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
because they've become so tiny and these
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
nanoparticles themselves could actually
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
cause health effects that's not related
 
04:15:24.889 --> 04:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
to wood burning stoves and I don't think
 
04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
you're talking about those kind of
 
04:15:28.610 --> 04:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
things no I'm not I am primarily
 
04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
concerned with
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
when we see what's out there for the
 
04:15:34.370 --> 04:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
science in terms of health impacts of
 
04:15:36.170 --> 04:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
fine particulate matter it seems likely
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
that EPA is going to be lowering the
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
standard in the future so we that's my
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
primary concern and and if that happens
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
and we get into a non-attainment
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
situation because of like wood smoke
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
from wood burning residential the Clean
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
Air Act is going to make us not only try
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
to go after that Source it's going to
 
04:15:57.530 --> 04:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
make us try to go after industry as well
 
04:15:59.929 --> 04:15:59.939 align:start position:0%
who are probably not really contributing
 
04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
so that's really the best course of
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
action is try to avoid getting there so
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
you don't have to inadvertently go with
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
those sources which probably are not
 
04:16:10.010 --> 04:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
going to help the problem
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you next step is representative
 
04:16:15.840 --> 04:16:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you next step is representative
oxen

04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
oxen
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen for taking these questions
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh you've you brought up the climate
 
04:16:25.490 --> 04:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
action plan that was developed in the
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
first decade of the 21st century is it
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
not true that the goals there pretty
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
much end with 2025 that it's not taking
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
us into our our next period of advance
 
04:16:42.769 --> 04:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
now the goals established in the climate
 
04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
action plan even though there's again
 
04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
there's no teeth in it it's a plan and
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
and there it was not adopted into
 
04:16:51.290 --> 04:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
statute or anything but it did recommend
 
04:16:53.150 --> 04:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire adopt goals and those
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
goals would go to 2050.
 
04:16:56.399 --> 04:16:57.710 align:start position:0%
goals would go to 2050.
okay

04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I believe you're aware and in fact
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
I know you're aware because I've
 
04:17:03.170 --> 04:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
discussed it with you that there's um a
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill excuse me Mr chair may I have a
 
04:17:05.520 --> 04:17:06.950 align:start position:0%
bill excuse me Mr chair may I have a
follow-up

04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
um we we have a climate action plan on
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
on the table for us to discuss today and
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
that plan has reduction goals for 20 20
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
35 25 35 and 50.
 
04:17:26.210 --> 04:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
um building on and incorporating much of
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
what was in that original plan
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
Could you
 
04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
um advise this committee or do you feel
 
04:17:35.090 --> 04:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for you to advise this
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee as to whether you think this
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
is a matter of some urgency that we
 
04:17:42.410 --> 04:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
should be taking up or that this is
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
something that can satisfactorily be um
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
retained and dealt with at some time in
 
04:17:50.689 --> 04:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.050 --> 04:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think uh certainly there is
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
some emergency to uh to the need for
 
04:17:57.769 --> 04:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
climate planning as to exactly how it's
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
done and who does it
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
um that is the the purview of your
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
committee and the and the legislature
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we uh uh again as I mentioned in my
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
testimony when I when I testified on
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
that legislation on again over in the
 
04:18:12.840 --> 04:18:13.969 align:start position:0%
that legislation on again over in the
Senate

04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
um we have extremely limited resources
 
04:18:17.809 --> 04:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
now compared to what we did back when
 
04:18:21.889 --> 04:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
when we did worked on the 2009 plan but
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant has been
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
significant developments in the body of
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
science around what types of goals are
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
necessary and what types of of actions
 
04:18:32.689 --> 04:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
are necessary
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
um but I also would put some emphasis on
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
um trying to understand and better
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
incorporating Regional approaches
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
because you know I think it's been made
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
a point you certainly can say if New
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does something it's not going
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
to affect anything
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but again if every state says that
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
then nothing happens and if every
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
country says that nothing happens but I
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
do think that if you look at actions
 
04:19:01.010 --> 04:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
that states in on in the Northeast
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
region are taking can we even coordinate
 
04:19:05.809 --> 04:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
with Canada some through an organization
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
called any gcp
 
04:19:10.090 --> 04:19:10.100 align:start position:0%
um we uh
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
we think that there are joint actions
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
that can be taken Reggie is a great
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
example the the Reggie region is
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
probably the 10th largest economy in the
 
04:19:18.060 --> 04:19:18.710 align:start position:0%
probably the 10th largest economy in the
world

04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:19:23.570 --> 04:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
um actions taken on a regional basis are
 
04:19:26.210 --> 04:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
are very very important for us to
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
consider participating in and being able
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
to do our share
 
04:19:34.010 --> 04:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
um but again what specific policies
 
04:19:35.570 --> 04:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know can make make recommendations
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
and provide information but um the
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
policies the policy adoption is uh the
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
purview of the legislature
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.729 --> 04:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
this wonderful testimony today
 
04:19:58.380 --> 04:19:59.809 align:start position:0%
this wonderful testimony today
um

04:19:59.809 --> 04:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go back to a fine
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
particle particular um pollution to any
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
great degree but
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh is this influenced at all I'm part by
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
ignorance uh due to the environmental
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
concerns by the uh
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
growing number of wildfires out in our
 
04:20:17.570 --> 04:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
western part of our country they
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
contribute significantly to our uh
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
um fine particular pollution they
 
04:20:24.530 --> 04:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
certainly can in certain circumstances I
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
mean as I mentioned there was the
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day event a number of years ago
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
where literally those were either
 
04:20:32.290 --> 04:20:32.300 align:start position:0%
Canadian wildfires or Western wildfires
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
there was also if you recall Western
 
04:20:37.490 --> 04:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
fires this year
 
04:20:40.130 --> 04:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
um that actually came very close to
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
impacting our air shed here it actually
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
got up high enough where literally it
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
went over us
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
if it had stuck at the ground level it
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
certainly would have impacted us
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
we we certainly do see more frequently
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
though uh impacts from uh from Canada
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
um you know as you if you watch uh your
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
your weather each night you see the uh
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
air masses coming in from from uh from
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
Canada a lot and uh coming down sweeping
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
across New York and and when there are
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
wildfires up there which there
 
04:21:13.250 --> 04:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
frequently are um we we see significant
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
impacts from those
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for that disquieting answer I
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative samsich is
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh this is not so
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
much a question but maybe just uh uh
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
asking you to comment on this uh you
 
04:21:39.410 --> 04:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
know not too long ago in the 80s
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
we had the whole issue of acid rain in
 
04:21:45.170 --> 04:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and how that was a big
 
04:21:49.490 --> 04:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
focus of the Clean Air Act and could you
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
comment on how how much how effective
 
04:21:55.010 --> 04:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
that was in reducing that problem here
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with the acidic levels
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
in in our lakes and and various areas
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
um people sometimes forget these kind of
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
efforts when they fade from the
 
04:22:07.729 --> 04:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
headlines but I think that was a success
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
story am I not mistaken I I would
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
venture to say that the acid rain
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
program in the United States was one of
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
the most successful environmental
 
04:22:19.729 --> 04:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
programs ever to come out of Congress
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
um it was literally a cap and trade type
 
04:22:22.140 --> 04:22:23.689 align:start position:0%
um it was literally a cap and trade type
program

04:22:23.689 --> 04:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
um that gave you know essentially gave
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
allowances to companies and allowed
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
people to find the most cost effective
 
04:22:29.100 --> 04:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
people to find the most cost effective
reductions

04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
um in their in Sulfur emissions and to
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
some degree nitrogen emissions but it's
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
been primarily sulfur it has been widely
 
04:22:38.279 --> 04:22:39.349 align:start position:0%
been primarily sulfur it has been widely
successful

04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
successful
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have seen probably and I have a chat
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
on this that I could provide the
 
04:22:45.769 --> 04:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
committee as well uh Des actually
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
believed it enough since the 1970s has
 
04:22:50.450 --> 04:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
been tracking the pH of rain water on
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
our own building here and we actually
 
04:22:54.410 --> 04:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
compiled that data a couple years ago
 
04:22:56.570 --> 04:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
and put out a report on that and some
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
graphs on that we can make that
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
available but it was tremendously
 
04:23:02.450 --> 04:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
successful uh you could see it in the
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
data you can see the Improvement in the
 
04:23:06.590 --> 04:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
pH of the rain water we're still not
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
back to Natural levels but we're getting
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
there you're never going to get to a
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
neutral level because you get carbon
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
dioxide in the atmosphere and that forms
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
a carbon acid as well as sulfuric acid
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
so but why these successful we can
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
certainly provide some information to
 
04:23:23.450 --> 04:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see Representatives partial
 
04:23:34.000 --> 04:23:34.010 align:start position:0%
you still have your hand up or okay
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
you still have your hand up or okay
[Music]

04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:39.170 --> 04:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
looks like no one else has a question so
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
at this point we'll say to like it once
 
04:23:43.809 --> 04:23:43.819 align:start position:0%
I was going to do earlier when I
 
04:23:45.889 --> 04:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
tried to ask my question really I
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't ask it oh representative Renner
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
um when he's touched on the pfast
 
04:23:56.399 --> 04:23:56.990 align:start position:0%
um when he's touched on the pfast
um

04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:59.150 --> 04:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
do you guys do anything in your division
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this proposed uh
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
landfill it's proposed to the North
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
country do you guys do anything when you
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
mention surface water or pfas I was just
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
curious yeah absolutely we uh uh we
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
regulate air emissions from landfills
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
and so any landfill needs to get a
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
permit from us
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
um pfest is not generally thought to be
 
04:24:22.370 --> 04:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
a significant air emissions problem from
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
from landfills there's some research
 
04:24:27.050 --> 04:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
going on right now
 
04:24:30.530 --> 04:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh but they are required to get a
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
permit from us for for their air
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
emissions as well as a solid waste
 
04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
permit those are two individual permits
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're not intertwined
 
04:24:41.809 --> 04:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
um and they uh any facility must get
 
04:24:41.819 --> 04:24:43.250 align:start position:0%
um and they uh any facility must get
both

04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we have had some questions because
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know Kathy did you is there
 
04:24:48.410 --> 04:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
anything you wanted to add on uh
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
landfill emissions related to pfest
 
04:24:53.689 --> 04:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
no I think you covered it there's been
 
04:24:55.130 --> 04:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
some studies that are going on about
 
04:24:57.490 --> 04:24:57.500 align:start position:0%
landfill gas but nothing consistent yeah
 
04:25:00.410 --> 04:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
but they're certainly there may be
 
04:25:00.420 --> 04:25:01.250 align:start position:0%
but they're certainly there may be
um

04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
you know leachate concerns and uh that
 
04:25:08.150 --> 04:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be the purview of the waste
 
04:25:10.250 --> 04:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
Division and their uh their Solid Waste
 
04:25:14.090 --> 04:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
permit and groundwater requirements
 
04:25:16.370 --> 04:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
um so two different two different media
 
04:25:18.050 --> 04:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:25:20.210 --> 04:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
um so yes concerns have been raised and
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
we we certainly are looking at that Mike
 
04:25:24.530 --> 04:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add just uh for the
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
representatives information that to date
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the year division has not received an
 
04:25:32.330 --> 04:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
application for that project so we
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
officially have nothing in front of us
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
at this point in time as the air
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
division there are other applications
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
for the solid waste permit or aot
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
permits but not the air division at this
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
point well thank you because that was
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be my question
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
including the town it's going in and
 
04:25:55.250 --> 04:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
I've stayed try to stay neutral but you
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying to gather information
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's all the I actually got three
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
emails while you guys were giving the
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
presentation on this landfill so so the
 
04:26:05.290 --> 04:26:05.300 align:start position:0%
big one proposed by Casello so uh
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative I will just add that when
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
when and if we receive an application
 
04:26:12.170 --> 04:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
um there will certainly there's
 
04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
certainly a public process that goes on
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
with the issuance of an air permit and
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
of course we would follow that procedure
 
04:26:20.330 --> 04:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
as required by the statute so
 
04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you the facility must have
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
both of those permits in hand before
 
04:26:27.370 --> 04:26:27.380 align:start position:0%
they can begin Construction
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi is
 
04:26:32.570 --> 04:26:32.580 align:start position:0%

yes we can do that
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
well seeing no other questions I would
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.110 --> 04:26:56.120 align:start position:0%

04:34:19.970 --> 04:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay we're back
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
the people now resume our full committee
 
04:34:24.650 --> 04:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
work session
 
04:34:28.490 --> 04:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
a variety of bills and I will open the
 
04:34:32.631 --> 04:34:32.641 align:start position:0%
floor for discussion on any bills that
 
04:34:38.209 --> 04:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.449 --> 04:34:44.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.459 --> 04:34:45.709 align:start position:0%
 
five

04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:34:49.849 --> 04:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the bills we could discuss would be
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
106 148 167 213
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
172 or 394.
 
04:35:02.580 --> 04:35:07.789 align:start position:0%
172 or 394.
representative

04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
to me highly
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
return to the ones that flow right out
 
04:35:15.131 --> 04:35:15.141 align:start position:0%
of the presentation we just had
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
172 is on the climate plan and the um
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
the carbon pricing I think we could
 
04:35:27.070 --> 04:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
probably get through in about 60 seconds
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and uh then as I mentioned earlier this
 
04:35:32.810 --> 04:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
morning I'm hoping that we can
 
04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
um act with some emergency on 153 which
 
04:35:37.730 --> 04:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
is the Broadband bill
 
04:35:37.740 --> 04:35:38.890 align:start position:0%
is the Broadband bill
foreign

04:35:38.890 --> 04:35:38.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
to prioritize my own bills but I'd just
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh as far as I'm concerned you can take
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
right off with either one of those
 
04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
builds if you'd like
 
04:35:53.810 --> 04:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's some other hands up
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
before I I mean I'd love to do that but
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to hear from somebody else
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
about their priorities
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
okay representative samsich
 
04:36:05.769 --> 04:36:05.779 align:start position:0%
oh what
 
04:36:09.470 --> 04:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have any priority I think uh we
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't waste any time if someone
 
04:36:12.529 --> 04:36:12.539 align:start position:0%
wants to say something they should say
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
it so Lee you might as well go ahead as
 
04:36:17.929 --> 04:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned
 
04:36:17.939 --> 04:36:18.830 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned
okay

04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
hand up for 106 before we cut away to
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
lunch so I was hoping that we could
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
conclude the conversation there because
 
04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
I I did have a point I was trying to
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
make before we went to break but
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's okay with me however we
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
want to attack
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
the afternoon's work I'm not adamant
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
about it I just think we were embroiled
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
in a discussion but we I don't think we
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
were quite done with it so
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
um so I guess that would be the way I
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
would approach it is to finish that and
 
04:36:59.090 --> 04:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
then go on but
 
04:36:59.100 --> 04:37:01.810 align:start position:0%
then go on but
um

04:37:01.810 --> 04:37:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.890 --> 04:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
thumbs down whether you think we should
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
continue oh thank you very much for
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
throwing it back to me um I also had my
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
hand up at the end of 106. so maybe if
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
we could do one one of your um you know
 
04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
time limited you know finish up 106 in
 
04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
the next 10 minutes and then move on to
 
04:37:21.769 --> 04:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
the others
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me so representative
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
McGee you're recognized thank you very
 
04:37:29.810 --> 04:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
much and I'll take my hand down now so I
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
don't keep it up there yeah the uh I
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
think the the point that I wanted to
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
make or the or for us to consider is
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
again on the arbitrariness of picking
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
something so that we can pass the bill
 
04:37:47.209 --> 04:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
because I think representative Lang made
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
it really clear that originally when the
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill came to me and I asked to be on it
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
with him
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
um it didn't have a cap and it was based
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
on the fact that we were trying to solve
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
something for municipalities and my
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are a number
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
of projects pending especially in some
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the larger cities around the state
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
that would be going up to that cap and
 
04:38:10.020 --> 04:38:10.910 align:start position:0%
that would be going up to that cap and
another

04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
point to make for folks who might not be
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
familiar with it is that representative
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
Lang made the point that municipalities
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
have to use a hundred percent of the
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
energy right so if they if they only use
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
90 of the energy
 
04:38:28.849 --> 04:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
um and they don't go to the full hundred
 
04:38:28.859 --> 04:38:30.349 align:start position:0%
um and they don't go to the full hundred
percent

04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:38:30.359 --> 04:38:31.429 align:start position:0%
percent
um

04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
then they're you know they're not making
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
back what they thought they were going
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
to make but if they but they can't net
 
04:38:37.561 --> 04:38:38.631 align:start position:0%
to make but if they but they can't net
meter

04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
meter
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
how am I going to explain this
 
04:38:41.760 --> 04:38:42.890 align:start position:0%
how am I going to explain this
if

04:38:42.890 --> 04:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:38:47.689 --> 04:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
you can't net meter for uh
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
I lost my point
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
I lost my point I had it written down
 
04:38:53.330 --> 04:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
but I don't have it anymore because it
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
was was in here so
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
you go on and I'll find my point and
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'll come back in
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up too right okay
 
04:39:05.810 --> 04:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative oxygen I'll find my point
 
04:39:07.849 --> 04:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I'll get back to you thank you very
 
04:39:07.859 --> 04:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
and I'll get back to you thank you very
much

04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:39:10.849 --> 04:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I think the point that Kat was trying
 
04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
to make was that they don't they're not
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell their excess and make
 
04:39:16.730 --> 04:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
money off of it they're held to that
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the amount that their own
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
consumption so that there isn't an issue
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
of cost shifting with with these um
 
04:39:28.189 --> 04:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
larger uh facilities the point that I
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
wanted to make earlier today was that
 
04:39:32.631 --> 04:39:32.641 align:start position:0%
they come in in discreet bits you can't
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
just say oh well you can do up to two
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts if if um Nashville would say
 
04:39:40.130 --> 04:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
is already at one megawatts and they
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to bring in there and what is it
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
called the nine Mills
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
um mines facility that's a three
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt entity you can't have part of
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
it in and part of it out so if you have
 
04:39:54.288 --> 04:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
a two megawatt cap you're saying nope
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
you you're you're completely not being
 
04:39:59.810 --> 04:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
helped by the bill if it has this um
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
artificial invitation of the two
 
04:40:03.890 --> 04:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap and we know that there are
 
04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
five megawatt facilities that Manchester
 
04:40:08.288 --> 04:40:08.298 align:start position:0%
is consider during conference
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
considering you know these these
 
04:40:12.890 --> 04:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
structures are really only cost
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
effective if they reach those kinds of
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
scale and again it benefits everyone if
 
04:40:24.530 --> 04:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
these municipalities are enabled to go
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
forward if they're artificially
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
constrained it's not going to be
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
protecting somebody's current
 
04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
electricity bill it's going to mean that
 
04:40:36.288 --> 04:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
we're not producing energy locally so
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be buying it from out of
 
04:40:39.410 --> 04:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
state we're going to be sending our
 
04:40:41.810 --> 04:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
money and that was Economic Development
 
04:40:44.570 --> 04:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
dollars out of state this is a good bill
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
as it stands we don't need this
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and and may I also raise the
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
point that I believe there's another
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment pending on this bill that was
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
being brought in by representative
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
McWilliams which we should probably also
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to discuss before we
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
leave this issue
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
04:41:08.330 --> 04:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams Amendment and
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
I was going to call on her to discuss
 
04:41:13.368 --> 04:41:13.378 align:start position:0%
her Amendment but she doesn't appear to
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
be here so I will go back to
 
04:41:18.610 --> 04:41:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
the point that I was planning to make
 
04:41:23.810 --> 04:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
which I think it wasn't understood by me
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I think most people are not aware
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
is that net metering is not possible for
 
04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
a fraction of what a generator generates
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
so if a generator is over one megawatt
 
04:41:39.410 --> 04:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
if they're 1.2 megawatt and the ceiling
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
is one megawatt they're not allowed to
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
do it at all so if you have generators
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
who have
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
three megawatts and you raise the
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
ceiling to two megawatts they can't net
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
meter for a fraction of what they
 
04:41:57.470 --> 04:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
generate so they're prohibited if you
 
04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
don't raise the cap all the way then
 
04:42:02.690 --> 04:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
then folks that have two or three or
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
four megawatts will they will not be
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
able to participate because you can't
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
you can't uh you can't net meter for a
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
fraction of your generation it has to be
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
the generation cap has to include how
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
much generation you produce does that
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
make sense I don't know if I'm
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
explaining it right but I I wasn't
 
04:42:24.170 --> 04:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
really aware of that so what it means is
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
that if you raise the cap to two and
 
04:42:28.610 --> 04:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
there's a hydro plant that generates
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
three they won't be able to participate
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
because they can't have only two
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
two megawatts of their three total
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
generation participate they have to
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
either participate or not participate so
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
you're excluding those folks who are
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
over two megawatts which is another
 
04:42:47.448 --> 04:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
reason why that arbitrary Choice doesn't
 
04:42:48.650 --> 04:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
make it
 
04:42:51.170 --> 04:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
an advancement it doesn't make it better
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
that Two Is Better Than One it still
 
04:42:55.128 --> 04:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
leaves out a bunch of people who are
 
04:42:56.930 --> 04:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
trying to participate so I guess that's
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the point I was trying to make
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
does it make does that make sense
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
because I I was not a point that I was
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes it made sense thank you we
 
04:43:08.650 --> 04:43:08.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate that all right thanks
 
04:43:12.250 --> 04:43:12.260 align:start position:0%
it's always confused me about Municipal
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities thinking about building
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities
 
04:43:21.770 --> 04:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
is why they can't figure out how to
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
justify the cost
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
so for example if the city of Concord
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
wants to build a
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
three megawatt
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
solar facility and it has the land on
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
which to build such a facility
 
04:43:36.240 --> 04:43:37.788 align:start position:0%
which to build such a facility
then

04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
they can lower their
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
Municipal electric load by three
 
04:43:41.940 --> 04:43:44.288 align:start position:0%
Municipal electric load by three
megawatts

04:43:44.288 --> 04:43:44.298 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
04:43:48.650 --> 04:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
continuously why isn't that sufficient
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
to allow them to go forward with the
 
04:43:52.440 --> 04:43:55.550 align:start position:0%
to allow them to go forward with the
projects

04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.230 --> 04:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying
 
04:43:57.240 --> 04:43:59.090 align:start position:0%
they're paying
uh

04:43:59.090 --> 04:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:01.610 --> 04:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
70 or 80 dollars a megawatt for a
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour for their electricity it
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
seemed to me like the savings would be
 
04:44:05.878 --> 04:44:07.850 align:start position:0%
seemed to me like the savings would be
tremendous

04:44:07.850 --> 04:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis and therefore I can
 
04:44:12.730 --> 04:44:12.740 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't feel they can go
 
04:44:16.850 --> 04:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
forward without
 
04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of them have I think I
 
04:44:24.530 --> 04:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
ier I know it's rhetorical or it's out
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
to everyone but people who want to speak
 
04:44:29.218 --> 04:44:37.850 align:start position:0%
to everyone but people who want to speak
so

04:44:37.850 --> 04:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um yeah I just
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
put in a plug for the forest industry
 
04:44:50.570 --> 04:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
and uh HB 213
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
um the the idea of eliminating thermal
 
04:44:57.050 --> 04:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
energy Rex isn't is a is a really bad
 
04:44:57.060 --> 04:44:58.610 align:start position:0%
energy Rex isn't is a is a really bad
idea

04:44:58.610 --> 04:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:45:00.830 --> 04:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and I I know that we're thinking of
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
retaining it anyway but I just want to
 
04:45:06.410 --> 04:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
underscore how important contribution it
 
04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
makes right now in our state this is a
 
04:45:11.930 --> 04:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
local energy source
 
04:45:14.570 --> 04:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
um they're they're finding ways of
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
partnering with various uh entities in
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
in nearby and
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
um I I think we we heard
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
um various stories from
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
um Berlin for example what they're
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
trying to do with their biomass plant
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so I think we we definitely should
 
04:45:34.010 --> 04:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that whatever we can generate
 
04:45:37.128 --> 04:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
in our state in the way of thermal
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
energy uh from wood products or other
 
04:45:43.610 --> 04:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
sources for that matter we should really
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
make that a priority to support So
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
eliminating it would be really a a step
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction I just wanted to
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
mention that because we're we're not
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking just about the energy they
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
create they create a whole host of
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
um secondary effects in the economy in
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
the environment in tourism uh indirectly
 
04:46:09.890 --> 04:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
as well as employment so
 
04:46:12.288 --> 04:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
um wants to keep that in mind when we're
 
04:46:15.490 --> 04:46:15.500 align:start position:0%
talking about those issues thank you
 
04:46:18.490 --> 04:46:18.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative before we I recognize the
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
next speaker I want to point out that
 
04:46:26.330 --> 04:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas who unfortunately
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
is not here meant to leave for a
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
important business activity
 
04:46:35.448 --> 04:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
he hadn't intended to submit this
 
04:46:38.930 --> 04:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
session a bill to create a study
 
04:46:40.850 --> 04:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
04:46:46.128 --> 04:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
find alternative uses of low-grade wood
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:46:50.050 --> 04:46:50.060 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:46:53.530 --> 04:46:53.540 align:start position:0%
Consortium of North Country
 
04:46:55.930 --> 04:46:55.940 align:start position:0%
individuals in Vermont
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
New York Maine
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
who are looking into this issue right
 
04:47:03.530 --> 04:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
now and New Hampshire would like to join
 
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
that effort
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
and a study Commission
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
established by this legislature
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
could lend Credence to that desire
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and enable the state to apply for some
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds so that we could join that
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
that effort
 
04:47:24.288 --> 04:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:47:27.650 --> 04:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas wanted to to
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
introduce this legislation to create
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
this study commission but
 
04:47:36.530 --> 04:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
with the new system we have of using ask
 
04:47:38.690 --> 04:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
OLS to create
 
04:47:38.700 --> 04:47:40.910 align:start position:0%
OLS to create
bills

04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:47:40.920 --> 04:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
bills
the

04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation essentially got lost in
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
his inbox and even though the bill was
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually written by OLS he didn't uh
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
realize that it was in his inbox it got
 
04:47:59.090 --> 04:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
buried under a bunch of other emails and
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
so he never approved
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
the LSR and so it got
 
04:48:05.218 --> 04:48:05.868 align:start position:0%
the LSR and so it got
um

04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
killed by OLS
 
04:48:12.670 --> 04:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages for retaining SB
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
hb213 would be that we could bring back
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
or bring forward that study Commission
 
04:48:20.400 --> 04:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
or bring forward that study Commission
and

04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
maybe turn HP 213 into a study
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
commission bill
 
04:48:30.610 --> 04:48:30.620 align:start position:0%
so that we could actually
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
speed up the process of developing
 
04:48:38.170 --> 04:48:38.180 align:start position:0%
a study of how to use New Hampshire
 
04:48:40.730 --> 04:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
low-grade Forest Products more
 
04:48:40.740 --> 04:48:41.810 align:start position:0%
low-grade Forest Products more
efficiently

04:48:41.810 --> 04:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
04:48:45.410 --> 04:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
find markets for them so uh for that
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
reason alone I think we should retain
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
between 213. excuse me Mr chair just a
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
clarification I believe that you told us
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we were not able to pass any kind
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
of study committee or study commission
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
that none of that would be passed in our
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
committee would that not circumvent that
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
idea if we merged it with a retained
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
Bill a little next session no because
 
04:49:13.910 --> 04:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to retain bills and bring
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
them forward early next year so if we
 
04:49:20.208 --> 04:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
see in 213 and then amend it to create
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
the study commission we can bring that
 
04:49:26.170 --> 04:49:26.180 align:start position:0%
forward in January of next year
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
well I think it's a great idea I solely
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
support that idea so thank you yeah okay
 
04:49:32.810 --> 04:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back from 213 to 106
 
04:49:41.570 --> 04:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
because the question that you put out
 
04:49:43.850 --> 04:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
there about why towns I started to
 
04:49:46.010 --> 04:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
answer that and I just wanted to
 
04:49:47.930 --> 04:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
add to the conversation while we're
 
04:49:51.230 --> 04:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
having the work meeting that
 
04:49:53.690 --> 04:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I think the premise behind having a
 
04:49:55.850 --> 04:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
net metering available
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
is to incent us to have more control
 
04:50:01.250 --> 04:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
over local production generation of
 
04:50:01.260 --> 04:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
over local production generation of
energy

04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
and so it is an incentive uh right for
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
investment it's not that cities and
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
towns won't invest or that they haven't
 
04:50:12.890 --> 04:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
invested or that they won't continue to
 
04:50:15.890 --> 04:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
invest but what it does is like every
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
other clean energy investment it gives
 
04:50:21.288 --> 04:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
the return on investments
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
um value uh to make the investment so it
 
04:50:28.490 --> 04:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
it it's uh it's an accelerator if you
 
04:50:30.170 --> 04:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
will and I think that that's how Most
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
states use net metering
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and so for my town in particular I
 
04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
know that we have problems with Peak
 
04:50:39.890 --> 04:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
because schools use their energy in the
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
middle of the day so even though they
 
04:50:43.250 --> 04:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
put solar panels on our elementary
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
school in the primary school
 
04:50:47.208 --> 04:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
they weren't seeing the return on
 
04:50:48.770 --> 04:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
investment that they had expected
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
because they don't qualify above that
 
04:50:54.530 --> 04:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
one megawatt for net metering rates and
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's an economics to the
 
04:50:59.690 --> 04:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
Investments that we don't really discuss
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
here I think sufficiently for us to be
 
04:51:04.970 --> 04:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
making good and logical decisions around
 
04:51:06.770 --> 04:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
how it's going to affect Downstream
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's municipalities or
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
businesses but that's the reason it's
 
04:51:14.330 --> 04:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
not that that towns don't have the money
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
in you know in all cases they don't but
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns are making uh room for in
 
04:51:22.010 --> 04:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
their budgets to make the Investments
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to get return on
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
that investment uh as rapidly if we
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
don't have policies that keep up with
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're I thought as a
 
04:51:32.570 --> 04:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
legislator supposed to be supporting the
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
idea of having more control and lowering
 
04:51:38.570 --> 04:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
our load demand basically as a state
 
04:51:40.730 --> 04:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
which will lower rates for everybody
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's my understanding of what
 
04:51:42.958 --> 04:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
that's that's my understanding of what
the

04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:46.010 --> 04:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
what um
 
04:51:48.170 --> 04:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know what's basically driving the
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I going back on to
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh 213 I think it's a great idea to have
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
a study committee and uh
 
04:52:09.890 --> 04:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
my only issue is maybe a procedural one
 
04:52:12.530 --> 04:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
if we retain this bill how soon would be
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
we be able to to change it into a study
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
committee bill
 
04:52:21.660 --> 04:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
committee bill
and

04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
is that all we would do I I guess
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
can you have a study committee bill that
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
would also take away uh T-Rex for
 
04:52:32.760 --> 04:52:35.270 align:start position:0%
would also take away uh T-Rex for
instance

04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.970 --> 04:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
to that last question the answer would
 
04:52:41.090 --> 04:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
be no
 
04:52:43.368 --> 04:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
if we changed this to a study committee
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
it would essentially replace the
 
04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would probably be the amendment
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
that would be offered
 
04:52:58.850 --> 04:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
the way retained bills work
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
is once you vote to retain a bill
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
you can no longer take any action on it
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
before the end of the current
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
calendar session
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
so that would mean that we couldn't take
 
04:53:17.948 --> 04:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
this calendar session ends which ends on
 
04:53:24.890 --> 04:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
roughly July about June 30th
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
then you're required to come back in the
 
04:53:27.600 --> 04:53:28.910 align:start position:0%
then you're required to come back in the
fall

04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
fall
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
or actually we could actually start soon
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
with that but by the by the first of
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
November or the first of December I
 
04:53:36.890 --> 04:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
forget which you have to make a decision
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with a retaining
 
04:53:38.400 --> 04:53:39.230 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with a retaining
bill

04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
either IPL it
 
04:53:45.230 --> 04:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
or you pass it or where you pass it as
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment so what would happen with
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
these retained bills is we'll come back
 
04:53:53.090 --> 04:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
in the fall we'll start having meetings
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't know maybe
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
late September
 
04:53:58.448 --> 04:53:58.458 align:start position:0%
through October
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
you'll have work sessions similar to the
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
one we're having now
 
04:54:05.930 --> 04:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
and then we'll actually
 
04:54:08.930 --> 04:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
end up having additional exec sessions
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
in which we decide whether to itl or
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
pass the bills that we have retained
 
04:54:18.890 --> 04:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's how it'll work and during the
 
04:54:21.530 --> 04:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
course of that process Amendments of
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
course are permissible so if we wanted
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
to to retain 213 now and then amend it
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
later we could do that you could do that
 
04:54:32.690 --> 04:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
with any of the bills
 
04:54:34.990 --> 04:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's how the process will work
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up Mr chair so would
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
we be able to vote on that amended bill
 
04:54:46.010 --> 04:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
in the fall and actually have it go to
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh a legislative session or does it have
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
to wait until the following year
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes we would be able to vote on it in
 
04:54:58.010 --> 04:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
the fall just in committee
 
04:55:02.570 --> 04:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
and then our recommendation would go to
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
the house the house doesn't start
 
04:55:08.690 --> 04:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
meeting again until after January 1st
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
okay once the house starts to meet again
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
then it would take up all the bills that
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
have been reported out of committee at
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
that point so I expect that next January
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
we'll start having house sessions fairly
 
04:55:25.610 --> 04:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
soon after the beginning of the year
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
because there will be a whole bunch of
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
pertained bills that will have been
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
reported out of committee and we'll be
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
having house sessions to decide what to
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
do with them
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
still so could I follow up on that Mr
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
chair because I still haven't gotten my
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
question completely answered okay one
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up and then we've got two
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
other hands so my question is
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh aren't we allowed to to uh submit new
 
04:55:56.570 --> 04:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
lsrs in the fall to be taken up
 
04:56:00.590 --> 04:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
next year yes we are absolutely and so
 
04:56:02.810 --> 04:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
the question is what the the reason I
 
04:56:07.010 --> 04:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
may bring this up I think that 213 is
 
04:56:09.890 --> 04:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
like this
 
04:56:13.330 --> 04:56:13.340 align:start position:0%
this Hammer that is kind of sitting over
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:56:15.360 --> 04:56:15.948 align:start position:0%
the the
um

04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
the economy as far as uh
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the amount of uh
 
04:56:23.638 --> 04:56:24.850 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the amount of uh
uh

04:56:24.850 --> 04:56:24.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
places that are going to want to install
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
um biomass
 
04:56:34.690 --> 04:56:34.700 align:start position:0%
uh heating systems that sort of thing
 
04:56:37.970 --> 04:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
they're they're less likely to decide to
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
do it waiting to for the outcome of this
 
04:56:45.050 --> 04:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation so
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
if we're only going to change it into a
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:56:49.020 --> 04:56:50.270 align:start position:0%
study committee
bill

04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:56:53.208 --> 04:56:53.218 align:start position:0%
we can do that in the fall anyway it it
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be
 
04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment to an existing bill
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
you are correct at least submit a new
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
LSR or we could create
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment to an existing Bill the
 
04:57:10.368 --> 04:57:10.378 align:start position:0%
advantage of doing the latter is it goes
 
04:57:12.050 --> 04:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
to the floor much sooner
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
if we submit an LSR
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
in the fall what happens is it gets
 
04:57:19.010 --> 04:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
converted into a bill then it gets
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
assigned to a committee it goes through
 
04:57:22.850 --> 04:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
the full committee process
 
04:57:25.490 --> 04:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
it goes to the house floor gets voted on
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
if it's voted on affirmatively it goes
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the Senate the Senate does the whole
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
thing all over again so the soonest this
 
04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
bill could could hit the the governor's
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
desk would be like August if it's an LSR
 
04:57:42.770 --> 04:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
but if we create a study committee bill
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
it will fall from an existing bill they
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
could hit the governor's desk as early
 
04:57:50.208 --> 04:57:50.218 align:start position:0%
as February or March
 
04:57:53.208 --> 04:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
so there is an advantage to converting
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
an existing bill
 
04:57:58.490 --> 04:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
rather than submitting the new LSR
 
04:58:01.250 --> 04:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work either way but we speed
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
up the process a little bit by
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
submitting an LSR chair recognizes
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative murder he just he just
 
04:58:08.448 --> 04:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
kind of answered it I was antsy trying
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
to get out of it we did a bill a couple
 
04:58:11.690 --> 04:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
years ago that chairman voles worked
 
04:58:14.690 --> 04:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
very very hard on it was uh Bill 700 we
 
04:58:17.330 --> 04:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
put 13 hours of testimony just in the
 
04:58:20.448 --> 04:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
month of October and at the end of it we
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
made it a study bill
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
we got it they worked on it we got it
 
04:58:26.930 --> 04:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
done and it became a law that the
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
following year it was an incredible
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishment people were way over here
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
people way over there and when the study
 
04:58:34.490 --> 04:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
Community get together
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
they put this together and we got it
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
done quicker than if we did the process
 
04:58:40.610 --> 04:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
of refiling the bill so uh to the
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
Chairman's Point uh it does work we did
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
it in this committee on a couple of
 
04:58:47.230 --> 04:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
bills and it does work
 
04:58:49.850 --> 04:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
so just leave it at that because that
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
was a huge project across the state huge
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
projects that was the uh utility uh
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
assessment methodology
 
04:59:04.010 --> 04:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman I kind of
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on your your own
 
04:59:12.170 --> 04:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
comments uh regarding uh why why
 
04:59:14.930 --> 04:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
financially uh some of these projects
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
can't just be built by municipalities
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the possible benefits that they
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
would achieve and I think somebody I
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
think it was uh representative oxenham
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the financial aspect
 
04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
I I would suggest maybe that we might
 
04:59:32.410 --> 04:59:32.420 align:start position:0%
want to have when we have an opportunity
 
04:59:34.910 --> 04:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
we won't might want to bring in some
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
people some Finance people to tell us
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
people who are not necessarily in the in
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
the business of selling us anything but
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
to go through the financing of how
 
04:59:47.690 --> 04:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects are financed
 
04:59:50.570 --> 04:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
both for private individuals as well as
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
for municipalities and businesses how
 
04:59:55.368 --> 04:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
does the financing come together where
 
04:59:59.090 --> 04:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
does Net metering play a role uh the
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements when is that a
 
05:00:05.090 --> 05:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
good idea when does it not work uh that
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
would be really useful for us to look at
 
05:00:09.288 --> 05:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
the framework of the financial part of
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
this and I think some of the questions
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have may be answered by those by such
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
a session that we would get a little bit
 
05:00:20.750 --> 05:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy economics 101 about
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
how this stuff all works because it's
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated intricate and
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes not not applicable everywhere
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm just making that suggestion
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
I like it it's a good idea we'll try to
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
put that together maybe you and I can
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
work on that together Mr chairman uh
 
05:00:41.448 --> 05:00:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Flint is recognized for a
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you I'm trying to
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
understand the comments I hear about
 
05:00:46.200 --> 05:00:47.690 align:start position:0%
understand the comments I hear about
local

05:00:47.690 --> 05:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
my current debate locally it's a Nissan
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
Rogue Japanese uh name but it's made in
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
Smyrna Tennessee
 
05:00:56.810 --> 05:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
my clothes aren't me
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
my house has been made locally it's
 
05:01:01.490 --> 05:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
manufactured home it's somehow local for
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
utility that for a plant is supposed to
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
be magic every plant that was built
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
locally been fought by crazy like a
 
05:01:11.208 --> 05:01:11.218 align:start position:0%
Seabrook in the in the gas that the
 
05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
combined cycle put into London there a
 
05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
good spot like hell uh Antrim plate the
 
05:01:17.930 --> 05:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
winds got fought like that what's so
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
look magic about local I don't know how
 
05:01:22.128 --> 05:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
many local if it's economic but if it's
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
not a rate pays Pockets I have a problem
 
05:01:28.490 --> 05:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is recognized
 
05:01:29.770 --> 05:01:29.780 align:start position:0%
for a comment
 
05:01:33.730 --> 05:01:33.740 align:start position:0%
piggybacking off of uh whatever it is
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
05:01:38.650 --> 05:01:38.660 align:start position:0%
costs and uh
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
renewable 101 I think the other side of
 
05:01:45.010 --> 05:01:45.020 align:start position:0%
the equation is what we've talked about
 
05:01:48.050 --> 05:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
these cost shifting and the cost
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
shifting issue is because Renewables are
 
05:01:55.010 --> 05:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
not reliable the hydro doesn't always
 
05:01:55.020 --> 05:01:56.150 align:start position:0%
not reliable the hydro doesn't always
run

05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
run
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
the sun doesn't always shine
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the wind doesn't always blow there needs
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
to be a reliable Baseline
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
system that exists because that cost and
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
if that cost is just deferred to the
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
utility customer and not those that
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from the uh Renewables there is
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
a cost shifting there so let's
 
05:02:23.208 --> 05:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
understand economics to the back side of
 
05:02:27.288 --> 05:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.850 --> 05:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for his point I
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
think the I think the point I heard
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
there was that capacity is different for
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
a base load Source versus a renewable
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
source which is more of an intermittent
 
05:02:50.930 --> 05:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
which is true and actually Hydro does
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
run all the time they basically shut it
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
off when they don't want it running but
 
05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
water runs but I guess if it's low maybe
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't depends on the particular
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
Hydro Source but Hydro tends to be uh
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
you know a higher capacity Factor than
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
some of the others that isn't the source
 
05:03:08.810 --> 05:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
of that that's why we do need a finance
 
05:03:10.850 --> 05:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
101 I think
 
05:03:15.288 --> 05:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
um that capacity Factor uh does
 
05:03:17.930 --> 05:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
does impact cost
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't cause cost shifting so
 
05:03:26.090 --> 05:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
back to the point that representative
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
Platt made
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
05:03:32.330 --> 05:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
um what's so great about local the idea
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
is that if we are able to generate power
 
05:03:38.570 --> 05:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
in our own towns
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
instead of importing it over the
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
transmission system and paying fossil
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
fuel companies who are all located out
 
05:03:48.890 --> 05:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
of state then we keep the we keep the
 
05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
energy dollars in the state right so it
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
generates into our economy it doesn't
 
05:03:53.520 --> 05:03:55.368 align:start position:0%
generates into our economy it doesn't
leave

05:03:55.368 --> 05:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:03:59.208 --> 05:03:59.218 align:start position:0%
um and also if we generate energy near
 
05:04:01.610 --> 05:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
to the source where it's being used
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
we eliminate the cost of the
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
transmission and we also lower the load
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
what is needed so it lowers the cost of
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
what we import uh in terms of fossil
 
05:04:14.810 --> 05:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
fuels through pipelines or other means
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
so as we lower our load our demand
 
05:04:23.930 --> 05:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh costs go down so we what we are
 
05:04:26.930 --> 05:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
trying to do is lower our costs by
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
producing more of the energy ourselves
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's the argument there's no shifting
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
to anybody if if I put up a solar panel
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I no longer need a bunch of Watts
 
05:04:37.970 --> 05:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
that I use throughout the year those
 
05:04:42.050 --> 05:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
kilowatts just don't get bought uh it
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that somebody else's
 
05:04:46.610 --> 05:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
bills go up they still use what they use
 
05:04:49.490 --> 05:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
so it's we're lowering
 
05:04:52.128 --> 05:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
our usage we're not
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're not shifting what I use to what
 
05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
you use it that doesn't happen so it's
 
05:04:59.930 --> 05:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's why we need somebody to come in
 
05:05:01.368 --> 05:05:01.378 align:start position:0%
and explain it so that we all understand
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
the same thing because we have an
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
impression of how it works but it's not
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily accurate and we owe it to
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
the people that we serve to get it right
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and and the reason I had my hand up
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
was because I thought that
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative pimental made a really
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
good point which is that we have heard
 
05:05:21.770 --> 05:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
from a number of people in the timber
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
industry in the forestry industry saying
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
that this is a you know a job killer for
 
05:05:26.458 --> 05:05:27.170 align:start position:0%
that this is a you know a job killer for
them

05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh 213 is is is a significant impact to
 
05:05:32.330 --> 05:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
them whether they can keep their doors
 
05:05:34.910 --> 05:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
open keep their people employed and I
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
think we should we should put that we
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
should factor that into whether or not
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
this gets it yelled or gets held like a
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
sort of Damocles over everybody's head
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
while they wait to see which way we fall
 
05:05:48.530 --> 05:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
on it
 
05:05:50.510 --> 05:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a really relevant point
 
05:05:52.850 --> 05:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
it this is a huge sector of the New
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy
 
05:05:57.770 --> 05:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
that we are sort of toying with by
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
leaving it out there and having people
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
not know whether we're going to be
 
05:06:03.170 --> 05:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
closing their doors for them
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to reiterate that I
 
05:06:06.288 --> 05:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
thought that that was something we
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
should be considering again economics
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
and I was the one that brought up the
 
05:06:09.900 --> 05:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
and I was the one that brought up the
economics

05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
economics
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bernardi is
 
05:06:13.200 --> 05:06:14.448 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bernardi is
recognized

05:06:14.448 --> 05:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:06:17.090 --> 05:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
again thank you
 
05:06:17.100 --> 05:06:18.288 align:start position:0%
again thank you
I

05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:06:20.930 --> 05:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
I expect this great I do believe that
 
05:06:23.090 --> 05:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
economics and caution needs to be
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
considered uh there are many Hydro small
 
05:06:29.090 --> 05:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
to male hydrogens that running spring
 
05:06:32.570 --> 05:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
when Melba happens and the waters are
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
high from the winter uh melt but in the
 
05:06:36.240 --> 05:06:37.310 align:start position:0%
high from the winter uh melt but in the
fall

05:06:37.310 --> 05:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
fall
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're not running at all after a nice
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
dry summer
 
05:06:42.120 --> 05:06:43.090 align:start position:0%
dry summer
um

05:06:43.090 --> 05:06:43.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
likewise other uh solar or whatever do
 
05:06:51.288 --> 05:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
not work all the time so the utilities
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
have to have enough capacity to cover
 
05:06:59.208 --> 05:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
anytime those Renewables aren't there
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
who pays for that that economic question
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
needs to be on the table as well and if
 
05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
support of Renewables and whatnot divert
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
those costs to one sector versus another
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's a legitimate question that needs
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.090 --> 05:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I agree with
 
05:07:27.890 --> 05:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's comment that
 
05:07:30.170 --> 05:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
those those are issues that really we
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
clear-eyed financially
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
however I want to point out to him that
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
economics doesn't seem to work always
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
the way we expect it many of us on this
 
05:07:45.970 --> 05:07:45.980 align:start position:0%
committee went to visit the gas-fired
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
power plant in Londonderry
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
and if some of you were there and
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
remember I asked them how often do you
 
05:07:52.798 --> 05:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
remember I asked them how often do you
run

05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
run
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
and they said 28 percent of the time
 
05:08:00.890 --> 05:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
well a capacity Factor 20 28 is not too
 
05:08:00.900 --> 05:08:02.208 align:start position:0%
well a capacity Factor 20 28 is not too
impressive

05:08:02.208 --> 05:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
05:08:04.550 --> 05:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they still manage sustain business
 
05:08:07.368 --> 05:08:07.378 align:start position:0%
even though they run only 28 percent of
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
the time so this idea that under other
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
sources are intermittent well here's a
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
source that is
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
um has chosen to be intermittent because
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
they want to play the game of when they
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
can make the most money and lo and
 
05:08:22.490 --> 05:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
behold they're still in business and
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
doing well so it doesn't always work the
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
way we think it works and now you can
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
add to that factor the the issue of
 
05:08:33.170 --> 05:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
battery storage which will make some of
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
these sources more flexible including
 
05:08:39.288 --> 05:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
the hydros that they can use that energy
 
05:08:41.448 --> 05:08:41.458 align:start position:0%
when that when they can get the best
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
price for instead of using it constantly
 
05:08:46.850 --> 05:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
because they have no way of of selling
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that power at the time they're
 
05:08:50.810 --> 05:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
generating it so all those things have
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
to be taken into consideration that's
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
why I think the economics picture is not
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
at all as clear as people think uh you
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
know this is not a real Market Market
 
05:09:03.650 --> 05:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
driven business and and it's a highly
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
regulated business so um it would be
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
good to know the rules of the road when
 
05:09:13.208 --> 05:09:13.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:15.288 --> 05:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
representative substance you make a good
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
point the Calpine plant in Londonderry
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
of course can run anytime
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
the reason it only runs 28 of the time
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
is because that's how often ISO New
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
England asks it to run
 
05:09:32.770 --> 05:09:32.780 align:start position:0%
because the price that it bit into the
 
05:09:34.788 --> 05:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh Market
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
is such that ISO New England calls on
 
05:09:40.850 --> 05:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
other cheaper generators before it calls
 
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
on the Latin the gas plant in
 
05:09:42.660 --> 05:09:43.788 align:start position:0%
on the Latin the gas plant in
Londonderry

05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
Londonderry
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it's available all the time you're
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
not run all the time but it's available
 
05:09:49.850 --> 05:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
all the time and I think representative
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
Bernardi's point was that
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
there are uh problems with Renewables in
 
05:09:58.730 --> 05:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
that they're not always available and
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
that is an issue they're not
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
dispatchable gas plants are dispatched
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
so that's important
 
05:10:08.810 --> 05:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative Krishan love to have
 
05:10:11.570 --> 05:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
you join this conversation you're next
 
05:10:15.050 --> 05:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking if we have anything on
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
deck in terms of thinking about the
 
05:10:19.730 --> 05:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
reliability of Renewables about energy
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
storage and ways that we could invest in
 
05:10:22.680 --> 05:10:23.690 align:start position:0%
storage and ways that we could invest in
that

05:10:23.690 --> 05:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:26.510 --> 05:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
um to sort of mitigate that problem as
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
well as you know keeping a variety of
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your question
 
05:10:35.400 --> 05:10:36.368 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your question
but

05:10:36.368 --> 05:10:36.378 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the batteries are we
 
05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
doing anything with batteries
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
for storing overage we have added
 
05:10:48.770 --> 05:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
storage to Statute in several different
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
places to make sure that battery storage
 
05:10:55.610 --> 05:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
as it becomes economically feasible it's
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
recognized as a viable source of energy
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I would say that at this point in time
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's economic feasibility is still
 
05:11:08.410 --> 05:11:08.420 align:start position:0%
fairly low
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative partial or did you have
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
another comment you wanted to make
 
05:11:12.480 --> 05:11:15.050 align:start position:0%
another comment you wanted to make
creation

05:11:15.050 --> 05:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
creation
 
05:11:18.410 --> 05:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative I yeah I guess I
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that I see
 
05:11:22.490 --> 05:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
storage as one potential way to to
 
05:11:24.890 --> 05:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of those Ebbs and flows in
 
05:11:28.250 --> 05:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
production as well as demand so that's
 
05:11:31.448 --> 05:11:31.458 align:start position:0%
another way to approach it in my opinion
 
05:11:34.610 --> 05:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
yes it's been fairly well recognized for
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
a long time that battery storage has
 
05:11:36.718 --> 05:11:37.910 align:start position:0%
a long time that battery storage has
potential

05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
potential
 
05:11:37.920 --> 05:11:39.170 align:start position:0%
potential
understand

05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:11:41.810 --> 05:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
that potentially representative murder
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
yes the owners of these biomass plants I
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
know that we've gone Rounds Around for
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
Lots quite a few years they sold they've
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
sold off four of them before that have
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
been bought by new investors now how
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
these plants work to sustain right now
 
05:11:58.730 --> 05:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
without even firing up they're getting a
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a month finally
 
05:12:02.448 --> 05:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
sort of New England as long as they can
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
be on within 24 hours so these guys
 
05:12:07.128 --> 05:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
bought these plants and are getting 1.2
 
05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars just to have the plants
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
sit there now if they the one in
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem wasn't even able to be turned
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
on when it needed to be turned on
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
because they weren't doing that so
 
05:12:18.650 --> 05:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
they'll take a hit for a hundred
 
05:12:20.050 --> 05:12:20.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars less
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the employers and the new
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
owners and there's one in Whitefield and
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
they're all playing the game so as much
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
as they're crying some of these about
 
05:12:31.368 --> 05:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
the new buyer or when it's not we have
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
one exception we have a plant in
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater where Mr O'Leary has came
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
and spoke to us many times he's very
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
honest and straightforward he runs all
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
the time but these other plants are
 
05:12:43.250 --> 05:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
really playing a game and it's similar
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
to what goes on down in Londonderry
 
05:12:46.850 --> 05:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
because they get that money from isil no
 
05:12:49.368 --> 05:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
matter whether they're on or off it's an
 
05:12:52.610 --> 05:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
on-demand payment they get so uh that's
 
05:12:53.810 --> 05:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
something I don't think that we know as
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
a committee and I was kind of shocked
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
because one of my best friends was the
 
05:12:59.208 --> 05:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
operator definitely how many left there
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
what the new owner said uh he says
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
they're just abusing it still so um as
 
05:13:07.250 --> 05:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
much as they ask for all these things I
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
do think the thermal credits are very
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
important to this all the small projects
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the Investments we have in the North
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
Country all our hospitals and schools
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
are running off them with with money
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
public money to pay for these to keep
 
05:13:19.970 --> 05:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
them going it's not no private money
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
involved with all those projects so uh I
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
actually wrote a couple of grants for
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
these uh projects so
 
05:13:28.368 --> 05:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
um but this the biomass thing I think is
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
very interesting I don't know if we knew
 
05:13:31.128 --> 05:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
that in that committee the big dick
 
05:13:32.810 --> 05:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
getting 1.2 million for just sitting
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
there so
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
well we did know that or at least
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
some of us did it those of us who have
 
05:13:45.550 --> 05:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
studied the iso the structure of the iso
 
05:13:48.288 --> 05:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
maybe the way the market works is
 
05:13:50.810 --> 05:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
everybody who wants to supply power to
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
ISM to England
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
solar and wind typically been in at zero
 
05:13:57.120 --> 05:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
solar and wind typically been in at zero
dollars

05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
gas plants typically bid in at
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
a dollar or two or three or four per
 
05:14:04.560 --> 05:14:05.810 align:start position:0%
a dollar or two or three or four per
megawatt

05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
05:14:09.050 --> 05:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
and then uh and you know with nuclear
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
plants and then coal and oil plants will
 
05:14:17.208 --> 05:14:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.090 --> 05:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
so then when I asked ISO in New England
 
05:14:23.208 --> 05:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
goes to provide Power on any given day
 
05:14:26.030 --> 05:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
they always take the lowest bid power
 
05:14:26.040 --> 05:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
they always take the lowest bid power
first

05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
and they add that to the grid and if
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
that satisfies the load then that's as
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
far as they go
 
05:14:36.170 --> 05:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't satisfy the the load then
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
they go to the next tier and they add
 
05:14:41.090 --> 05:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
those generators
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the price that gets paid to
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
everybody is the price that gets paid to
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
the last generator in
 
05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
it and so on and so forth it keeps going
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
up and up two weeks ago everybody that's
 
05:14:57.530 --> 05:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
how we got to the point last month and
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
it was so cold and everything turned on
 
05:15:02.208 --> 05:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
where the coal plant over in Beau was
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
operating every single day but they bid
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
in pretty high you know like
 
05:15:07.280 --> 05:15:09.070 align:start position:0%
in pretty high you know like
yeah

05:15:09.070 --> 05:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:15:13.010 --> 05:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
so the uh the price of
 
05:15:15.530 --> 05:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
electricity the iOS ISO New England
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
region was very very high as a result
 
05:15:20.690 --> 05:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:15:22.730 --> 05:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know Beau has run for pretty much
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
every day out of the last six weeks so
 
05:15:28.128 --> 05:15:28.138 align:start position:0%
they're not only earning their thousand
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a month in
 
05:15:31.250 --> 05:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
capacity payments although for Bo I
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
think it's worth it
 
05:15:35.810 --> 05:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
money for the power that they actually
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
generate so right now there's they're
 
05:15:40.010 --> 05:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
raking in a lot of money that's how the
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
market was designed and that's how it
 
05:15:42.360 --> 05:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
market was designed and that's how it
works

05:15:43.250 --> 05:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
works
 
05:15:46.128 --> 05:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
can it works that way for the biomass
 
05:15:49.730 --> 05:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
plants too they can either generate
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
power and earn money from the generation
 
05:15:55.368 --> 05:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
of power plus they can sell the wrecks
 
05:15:57.170 --> 05:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
for the power they do generate
 
05:15:58.970 --> 05:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
or they can just collect their capacity
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.330 --> 05:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
sit plant sit there and
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically so either way it works
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay next step is uh representative
 
05:16:13.200 --> 05:16:20.510 align:start position:0%
okay next step is uh representative
McGee

05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to all of the information
 
05:16:24.530 --> 05:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
that you're putting out and that others
 
05:16:28.128 --> 05:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
have talked about and it just reinforces
 
05:16:31.128 --> 05:16:31.138 align:start position:0%
for me the complexity of the decisions
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
that we make in terms of policy because
 
05:16:35.230 --> 05:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
what I had written down was
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the scale of the solutions
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're proposing and I got that from
 
05:16:40.080 --> 05:16:41.510 align:start position:0%
we're proposing and I got that from
listening

05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
listening
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um to representative creation talking
 
05:16:46.250 --> 05:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
about battery storage because if we
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
could use battery storage to
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
handle our Peaks and all that if we had
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
that capacity at this point there'd be
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
more investment there it is a solution
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
but it is a small scale solution and we
 
05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
don't talk about any of the solutions at
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
scale we don't have an overall plan
 
05:17:06.530 --> 05:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
um reliability is what isil is
 
05:17:11.448 --> 05:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
responsible for and we do to
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Bernardi's point we we
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
require base load to meet that
 
05:17:18.890 --> 05:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
reliability requirement
 
05:17:22.128 --> 05:17:22.138 align:start position:0%
so you need base load and one of the
 
05:17:23.690 --> 05:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
problems with the nuclear plant which
 
05:17:26.570 --> 05:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
isn't putting carbon in the air is that
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been able to load follow in
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the current configuration that it's in
 
05:17:30.000 --> 05:17:31.010 align:start position:0%
the current configuration that it's in
so

05:17:31.010 --> 05:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
we have all of these different competing
 
05:17:37.850 --> 05:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
factors the capacity Factor the load
 
05:17:40.850 --> 05:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
following Factor the cost factor and
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
another thing that used to be discussed
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
a lot in New Hampshire policy was fuel
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
diversity as being a way of keeping
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
competition so that no single type of
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
fuel source
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
could have a monopoly and be able to
 
05:17:58.970 --> 05:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
charge whatever it wanted so the the
 
05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
markets around ISO are still providing
 
05:18:03.650 --> 05:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
that diversity right because they they
 
05:18:05.208 --> 05:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
go out and they look at where they can
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
get the cheapest
 
05:18:09.170 --> 05:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and part of the reason you have to
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
keep those idle biomass plants to the
 
05:18:14.930 --> 05:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
side is that you need pink or plants and
 
05:18:16.970 --> 05:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's probably cheaper to have them there
 
05:18:19.250 --> 05:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
not doing anything and at least know
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
that you have that capability but that's
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
the stuff we have to understand before
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
we undertake policies that just throw it
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
all up in the air because it's uh a lot
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
more complicated than just you know this
 
05:18:35.208 --> 05:18:35.218 align:start position:0%
is cost shifting like that's not that's
 
05:18:37.550 --> 05:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
not all that's happening and the and the
 
05:18:39.050 --> 05:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
other question I think that would be
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
really important for us to address when
 
05:18:43.368 --> 05:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
we take a look at the suite of policies
 
05:18:47.448 --> 05:18:47.458 align:start position:0%
that come across our committee's desk is
 
05:18:49.368 --> 05:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
really what are we trying to achieve
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to solve if anything
 
05:18:54.650 --> 05:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
with the policies that we're putting
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
forward this year and I just feel for me
 
05:18:59.448 --> 05:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
it's we're really lacking in that
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
department in terms of being able to
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
have conversations around what does it
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
do we want to get done
 
05:19:08.930 --> 05:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so I I feel bad that we
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
don't do that because no matter what we
 
05:19:13.368 --> 05:19:13.378 align:start position:0%
bring up there's always a counter
 
05:19:15.170 --> 05:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
argument there's always another piece
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
because it's complicated but if we had
 
05:19:20.090 --> 05:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
some clear objectives we probably would
 
05:19:23.208 --> 05:19:23.218 align:start position:0%
have a better ability to talk about them
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
in a confined way and get the answers
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
so I I just wish we could do more of
 
05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
that I'm really glad we're having a work
 
05:19:32.090 --> 05:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
session today so we can talk
 
05:19:33.890 --> 05:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
we have a committee and to just
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
everybody to just go home and make up
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
what they think is hard
 
05:19:40.730 --> 05:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of different
 
05:19:42.650 --> 05:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
experience here and it's very helpful to
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
hear from other people
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
so that's all I just wrote down a bunch
 
05:19:47.690 --> 05:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
of different things because people are
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
covering it's like Bing Bing Bing you
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
know and all of it's relevant but we
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
have to focus on whatever it is we're
 
05:19:58.010 --> 05:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
trying to do before we can have the
 
05:20:00.170 --> 05:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
answers about which is the right way to
 
05:20:00.180 --> 05:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
answers about which is the right way to
go

05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
so the complexity that we that you
 
05:20:06.840 --> 05:20:07.810 align:start position:0%
so the complexity that we that you
address

05:20:07.810 --> 05:20:07.820 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
helps to explain why ISO New England
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
employs over 500 people right yeah
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
up next is representative partial
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman VOS
 
05:20:20.878 --> 05:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman VOS
um

05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
I was going to speak about diversity as
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
well and I said thanks uh to
 
05:20:27.470 --> 05:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for touching on
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
that I really see it as our future and
 
05:20:31.080 --> 05:20:32.270 align:start position:0%
that I really see it as our future and
um

05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
with diversity we're one of the
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of keeping more of our
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
production right here in New Hampshire
 
05:20:39.170 --> 05:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
rather than relying on other states
 
05:20:42.050 --> 05:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
and I think that will probably be uh key
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
for our economic development in the
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
future as well
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
and it's it's composition is good I I
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
would hate to see anything at biomass
 
05:20:53.930 --> 05:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
solar any nuclear I would hate to see
 
05:20:56.030 --> 05:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
any of these i options being taken off
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
the table if it means that we're going
 
05:20:59.810 --> 05:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:21:02.090 --> 05:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
allow other companies to have more
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
Monopoly so I see it's working in um in
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
our in the consumer is good in that way
 
05:21:08.040 --> 05:21:09.050 align:start position:0%
our in the consumer is good in that way
um

05:21:09.050 --> 05:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:21:14.448 --> 05:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
oh and uh
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
also being reliant on one type of fuel
 
05:21:18.770 --> 05:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
also it's concern of mine or we saw what
 
05:21:21.170 --> 05:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
happened in Texas we said like uh when
 
05:21:23.330 --> 05:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
there are gas uh facilities could not
 
05:21:24.530 --> 05:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
run I don't think we're facing that
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
exact situation here but I would hate us
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
moving down the road towards that
 
05:21:28.080 --> 05:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
moving down the road towards that
situation

05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
I was mentioning that sun doesn't always
 
05:21:34.368 --> 05:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
shine or you know some of these
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
Renewables are not always uh
 
05:21:37.378 --> 05:21:38.810 align:start position:0%
Renewables are not always uh
uh

05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:41.208 --> 05:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
available at peak times
 
05:21:42.650 --> 05:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
but I like to point out the vowels are
 
05:21:44.208 --> 05:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
you the gas market right now I've seen
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
gas in my own lifetime go from 27 cents
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
a gallon to uh I don't know what it is
 
05:21:51.708 --> 05:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
now I don't drive anymore I don't go to
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
the gas station my electric car but I
 
05:21:55.730 --> 05:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
know that I mean we're talking about uh
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
limited product it's only going to
 
05:22:01.128 --> 05:22:01.138 align:start position:0%
become more volatile as uh as we went
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
out of oil I I would rather excuse
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
looking towards the future
 
05:22:06.288 --> 05:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
and last I would like to thank all
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
everybody here for making this such an
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
educational day in particular
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I would love
 
05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
to hear more about uh
 
05:22:17.448 --> 05:22:17.458 align:start position:0%
um your view on the biomass
 
05:22:17.458 --> 05:22:18.288 align:start position:0%
um your view on the biomass
um

05:22:18.288 --> 05:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:21.050 --> 05:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh plants I have one question for you if
 
05:22:21.890 --> 05:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
I could
 
05:22:25.010 --> 05:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
are they right now currently buying soft
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
wood products to fire these plants
 
05:22:29.208 --> 05:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
because if they're not running they
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't need to buy soft wood I gather so
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's already well I don't know I I do
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.760 --> 05:22:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:22:46.490 --> 05:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
if Mr Harrington wanted to respond to
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
that first I'm fine with that
 
05:22:56.448 --> 05:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
representative Arrington
 
05:22:57.970 --> 05:22:57.980 align:start position:0%
did you want to respond to
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you want to
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:11.470 --> 05:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing he actually all right
 
05:23:14.090 --> 05:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
shower sometime
 
05:23:16.128 --> 05:23:16.138 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:23:19.970 --> 05:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things number one uh
 
05:23:24.530 --> 05:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
getting back uh to HB 213 I'm just
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if maybe uh representative
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
Thomas could uh
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
dig into his uh emails and find that LSR
 
05:23:40.550 --> 05:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
and uh get it over to lob uh OLS to get
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
it written into a an amendment and we
 
05:23:44.040 --> 05:23:44.930 align:start position:0%
it written into a an amendment and we
can

05:23:44.930 --> 05:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
take up 213
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
and get an amendment done which will
 
05:23:52.490 --> 05:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
change it to whatever
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking about a study committee
 
05:23:58.550 --> 05:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can go ahead and um
 
05:24:02.090 --> 05:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh retain it at that point and that way
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
we would not have this whole issue of
 
05:24:06.480 --> 05:24:07.010 align:start position:0%
we would not have this whole issue of
um

05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:10.128 --> 05:24:10.138 align:start position:0%
of the of the uh
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
biomass and the uh wood pulp industry
 
05:24:17.690 --> 05:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
the timber industry wondering uh what's
 
05:24:20.090 --> 05:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
hap gonna happen next so so I have a
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more uh
 
05:24:25.128 --> 05:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
uh they could relax a little bit more
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
through the next year
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
um that's my first suggestion and then
 
05:24:33.170 --> 05:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
the other suggestion I think I wanted to
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
bring up was that we've been talking
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
about how
 
05:24:39.120 --> 05:24:40.010 align:start position:0%
about how
um

05:24:40.010 --> 05:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:42.288 --> 05:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
renewable energies
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
are not always on
 
05:24:45.000 --> 05:24:46.368 align:start position:0%
are not always on
and

05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
um therefore they're not any good
 
05:24:55.610 --> 05:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
and yet we did have a bill at HP 407
 
05:24:59.690 --> 05:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
where we were going to uh allow
 
05:25:02.770 --> 05:25:02.780 align:start position:0%
up to five megawatt storage facilities
 
05:25:06.650 --> 05:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
to be uh limited producers
 
05:25:10.730 --> 05:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
and uh that was itl'd
 
05:25:14.330 --> 05:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
10 11 to 10 so I mean we have an
 
05:25:17.810 --> 05:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make Renewables a little
 
05:25:17.820 --> 05:25:19.610 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make Renewables a little
more

05:25:19.610 --> 05:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:25:19.620 --> 05:25:21.368 align:start position:0%
more
um

05:25:21.368 --> 05:25:21.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:25.490 --> 05:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
dependable and we kind of
 
05:25:28.490 --> 05:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything about it
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's all thanks
 
05:25:34.490 --> 05:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh Representatives
 
05:25:34.500 --> 05:25:38.288 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh Representatives
recognized

05:25:38.288 --> 05:25:38.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.448 --> 05:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a question
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
to refer everybody who is here right now
 
05:25:46.128 --> 05:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
I two days ago I heard from a friend of
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
mine uh the the
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
um message that he had heard that
 
05:25:54.410 --> 05:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
because of the uh the disaster in Texas
 
05:25:57.490 --> 05:25:57.500 align:start position:0%
with their storm and their energy system
 
05:26:01.010 --> 05:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
that as the result of that propane
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
prices have spiked and for a lot of
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
people in the North Country here in New
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are heating their homes
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
with propane they may be facing very
 
05:26:13.730 --> 05:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
high prices shortly does anyone know
 
05:26:18.250 --> 05:26:18.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
my representative cambrose is recognized
 
05:26:24.050 --> 05:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
yes I can tell you uh personally that my
 
05:26:26.570 --> 05:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
propane bills have gone up in the last
 
05:26:29.930 --> 05:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
three months from 140 a gallon to 180
 
05:26:29.940 --> 05:26:31.730 align:start position:0%
three months from 140 a gallon to 180
000.

05:26:31.730 --> 05:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
000.
 
05:26:34.090 --> 05:26:34.100 align:start position:0%
mine just went from
 
05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
150 around 150 to 258 a gallon my last
 
05:26:40.970 --> 05:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
paid my last shipment they went up over
 
05:26:42.770 --> 05:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
a dollar a gallon
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a comment
 
05:26:53.208 --> 05:26:53.218 align:start position:0%
I have a propane contract I pay a dollar
 
05:26:56.810 --> 05:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
69 a gallon a month a year cash deal
 
05:26:58.970 --> 05:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
just because
 
05:26:58.980 --> 05:27:01.550 align:start position:0%
just because
uh

05:27:01.550 --> 05:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:03.650 --> 05:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative shops that you are
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices all over the Eastern
 
05:27:13.090 --> 05:27:13.100 align:start position:0%
Seaboard half gone up as a result of the
 
05:27:15.288 --> 05:27:15.298 align:start position:0%
situation in Texas
 
05:27:15.298 --> 05:27:16.430 align:start position:0%
situation in Texas
yeah

05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
some of their welds stopped producing
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
because some of the pumps and stuff
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
another facilities froze up so
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's classic supply and demand
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
the demand is still there but the supply
 
05:27:32.570 --> 05:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
has gone down so the price goes
 
05:27:34.610 --> 05:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
05:27:36.890 --> 05:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
would only had that I think uh shutting
 
05:27:41.948 --> 05:27:41.958 align:start position:0%
down the pipeline
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
project added
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
a futuristic
 
05:27:55.090 --> 05:27:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
at the angeries of weather and they will
 
05:28:03.050 --> 05:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
always plague us in one way or another
 
05:28:04.868 --> 05:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative play
 
05:28:07.970 --> 05:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
yeah the both Texas
 
05:28:10.090 --> 05:28:10.100 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a capacity Market
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
strictly relying on an energy market so
 
05:28:15.410 --> 05:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
Energy prices went sky-highed at seven
 
05:28:17.810 --> 05:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
dollars a kilowatt hour didn't get 17
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
000 bills
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
and because they had no capacity Market
 
05:28:22.730 --> 05:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
there was no incentive for people to be
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
to be on standby with with actual people
 
05:28:28.970 --> 05:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
on the planet and those are the level of
 
05:28:30.650 --> 05:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
persuasion will point to the gas plant
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's also a conservative of the
 
05:28:35.090 --> 05:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
persuasive the point of the windmills
 
05:28:37.550 --> 05:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
were all correct the windmills weren't
 
05:28:39.530 --> 05:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
coated with blood the blades were
 
05:28:53.410 --> 05:28:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:53.420 --> 05:28:55.090 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:28:55.090 --> 05:28:55.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
what they have to provide for
 
05:28:57.600 --> 05:29:00.830 align:start position:0%
what they have to provide for
reliability

05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:03.830 --> 05:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative man did you
 
05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yeah yes I did a
 
05:29:08.810 --> 05:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
second ago I just was going to uh
 
05:29:11.090 --> 05:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
mention that a lot of us are being new
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
haven't maybe seen the Northfield
 
05:29:13.680 --> 05:29:15.350 align:start position:0%
haven't maybe seen the Northfield
Massachusetts

05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:29:17.448 --> 05:29:17.458 align:start position:0%
um pump storage where they have a lake
 
05:29:18.890 --> 05:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
high up on a hill
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they when electricity is cheap they
 
05:29:23.930 --> 05:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
Pump It Up from the Connecticut River
 
05:29:25.850 --> 05:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
and fill the lake and when it's high
 
05:29:28.970 --> 05:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
priced they generate electricity pouring
 
05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
the water back down
 
05:29:33.948 --> 05:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be a model for the uh
 
05:29:35.868 --> 05:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
that we could just think of that model
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
and use you know the biomass plants as
 
05:29:40.970 --> 05:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know something you can call on when
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
you need it
 
05:29:45.780 --> 05:29:48.410 align:start position:0%
you need it
essentially

05:29:48.410 --> 05:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:29:51.050 --> 05:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay good idea representative oxygen
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
just a mental model
 
05:29:57.170 --> 05:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.448 --> 05:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
been really excellent that we have an
 
05:30:01.250 --> 05:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about some of the
 
05:30:03.050 --> 05:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
things that we know a little about and
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that some people know
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
more about and but we have
 
05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
an issue before us on the table today
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
which is a number of bills that that are
 
05:30:14.810 --> 05:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
awaiting action
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think that representative
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
pimentel's point about 213 is very well
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
taken if we could
 
05:30:25.550 --> 05:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
um agree that you know we would like to
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
see a study committee coming out of this
 
05:30:29.830 --> 05:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
and take that sort of Damocles off
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state have told
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature over and over again that
 
05:30:37.490 --> 05:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
they don't like surprises they don't
 
05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
like changes they need an investment
 
05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
climate that they have some stability
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
and they can forecast developments they
 
05:30:47.570 --> 05:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
think five six ten years out in terms of
 
05:30:50.690 --> 05:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
Investments this it's really
 
05:30:54.530 --> 05:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
harmful for our constituents to leave
 
05:30:56.810 --> 05:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
this um hanging out there if it's not
 
05:30:58.128 --> 05:30:58.138 align:start position:0%
something that we think we're going to
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
proceed with so if if we could get
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
accomplished one thing this afternoon uh
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:31:08.448 --> 05:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
maybe have a straw poll to see whether
 
05:31:11.810 --> 05:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
we should ask OLS for for that um
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that could be very
 
05:31:14.280 --> 05:31:17.948 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that could be very
useful

05:31:17.948 --> 05:31:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.958 --> 05:31:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:19.850 --> 05:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
the sermons were already there
 
05:31:23.930 --> 05:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative murder you think Mr the
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
thoroughs are already there I mean this
 
05:31:28.610 --> 05:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
bill is to take away the thermals can
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
already do that so I mean we're not you
 
05:31:31.730 --> 05:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
know we're not you know if nothing
 
05:31:33.530 --> 05:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
happens with this bill it's not going to
 
05:31:36.770 --> 05:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
change the climate out there it's it is
 
05:31:38.930 --> 05:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
what it is right now I mean is there
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
fear that we might lower them I think
 
05:31:42.770 --> 05:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much a consensus that's not
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
going to happen so I mean that's why we
 
05:31:48.170 --> 05:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
want to put together a study committee
 
05:31:51.170 --> 05:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure we get it right
 
05:31:52.970 --> 05:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:00.288 --> 05:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
audition we should make that known and
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
not leave the public and these
 
05:32:04.250 --> 05:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
businesses feeling like at any moment
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
the road could be dragged out from under
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
them so if if we could make that bill
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
into an amendment and have it replace
 
05:32:13.850 --> 05:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
the bill and we could vote that through
 
05:32:16.610 --> 05:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
on Monday that that would be a
 
05:32:20.930 --> 05:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
significant accomplishment for um a
 
05:32:22.128 --> 05:32:22.138 align:start position:0%
major sector of the New Hampshire
 
05:32:22.138 --> 05:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
major sector of the New Hampshire
economy

05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.050 --> 05:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea but we couldn't do it
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
on Monday because we'd have to have a
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on that Amendment because
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's a complete replacement of the bill
 
05:32:38.810 --> 05:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
with a completely new idea and while I
 
05:32:38.820 --> 05:32:40.190 align:start position:0%
with a completely new idea and while I
assume

05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
assume
 
05:32:42.890 --> 05:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
the general public would be open to and
 
05:32:46.368 --> 05:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
amenable to the idea we really shouldn't
 
05:32:46.378 --> 05:32:46.910 align:start position:0%
amenable to the idea we really shouldn't
um

05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:51.610 --> 05:32:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.050 --> 05:32:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh the idea is to pass the amendment and
 
05:33:03.770 --> 05:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
then retain it so we'll we'll have
 
05:33:09.170 --> 05:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe I didn't make myself clear
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
the point I was trying to make is that
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can't pass an amendment
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
like that without having the public
 
05:33:21.170 --> 05:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment because it's a
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
completely different
 
05:33:24.410 --> 05:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
it would turn the bill into a completely
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
different bill
 
05:33:27.708 --> 05:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
so everybody who attended the original
 
05:33:30.530 --> 05:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 213 would perceive to
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
be perceive it to be one thing but if we
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
changed it to something completely
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
different without a public hearing they
 
05:33:40.368 --> 05:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know that so we would have to
 
05:33:41.930 --> 05:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
what about 315
 
05:33:46.730 --> 05:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:33:50.570 --> 05:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
HP 315 wasn't changed completely it was
 
05:33:52.550 --> 05:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
modified but it certainly wasn't changed
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
completely uh and the
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
we had two public hearings on hb315 so
 
05:34:04.850 --> 05:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be surprised with the
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
amended version of hp315 it's still
 
05:34:09.050 --> 05:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
about Community aggregation and
 
05:34:10.610 --> 05:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
Community power it's not about something
 
05:34:12.530 --> 05:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
completely different it's not about a
 
05:34:13.850 --> 05:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:34:19.730 --> 05:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.490 --> 05:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman
 
05:34:24.650 --> 05:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible for us to
 
05:34:28.970 --> 05:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
actually schedule a another hearing for
 
05:34:28.980 --> 05:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
actually schedule a another hearing for
um

05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:33.890 --> 05:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh that would be March 12th Friday
 
05:34:36.530 --> 05:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
that would still give us time before the
 
05:34:40.250 --> 05:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
final date of March 18th that bills have
 
05:34:43.610 --> 05:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
to be acted on by uh if we really wanted
 
05:34:46.430 --> 05:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
to have this amendment or this study
 
05:34:49.970 --> 05:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
committee replacing this bill we could
 
05:34:54.840 --> 05:34:54.850 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.850 --> 05:34:56.208 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:34:58.550 --> 05:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
our public hearing I believe you have to
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
get a week's notice
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
so earliest
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
notice it with the next week's calendar
 
05:35:11.470 --> 05:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
March 19th
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
now the speaker did
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
under the authority ran into him by rule
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%

headlines
 
05:35:28.550 --> 05:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
so it might be possible to help
 
05:35:31.610 --> 05:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
carrying on March 19th but I'll have to
 
05:35:34.430 --> 05:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
verify that with the clerk before
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
we commit to going forward what about
 
05:35:40.850 --> 05:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:43.010 --> 05:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
dot dot
 
05:35:43.020 --> 05:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
dot dot
press

05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
press
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
the calendar of March 11th
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
would need to notice the meeting uh yeah
 
05:35:50.340 --> 05:35:51.770 align:start position:0%
would need to notice the meeting uh yeah
okay

05:35:51.770 --> 05:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:35:59.810 --> 05:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
05:36:06.708 --> 05:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
mention I uh on hb213's combined
 
05:36:09.650 --> 05:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
hearings we had one person in support of
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
HB 213 and we had 366 people who signed
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
in opposed
 
05:36:18.410 --> 05:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
so we we would need to have legally and
 
05:36:20.090 --> 05:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
technically we would need to have a
 
05:36:22.368 --> 05:36:22.378 align:start position:0%
hearing uh if the if the bill were
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
substantly substantively going to change
 
05:36:28.850 --> 05:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
but I guess my point would be that there
 
05:36:31.010 --> 05:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't really anybody that we heard from
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
that was affected by that bill that was
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of it so we do know how the
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
public feels about the bill as it is
 
05:36:39.708 --> 05:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
we heard from a lot of different people
 
05:36:44.930 --> 05:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh that were affected by it
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman I I forgot to lower my
 
05:36:59.208 --> 05:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
hand here representative oxenham
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd just like to Second your
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
suggestion that that you discussed this
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
with the clerk because I think with this
 
05:37:07.490 --> 05:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
sort of four weeks out before we get to
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the session we really do have an opening
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
here to make some changes to advance
 
05:37:20.270 --> 05:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I will do that I will
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
check with the clerk and find out
 
05:37:24.718 --> 05:37:25.970 align:start position:0%
check with the clerk and find out
when

05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
we could hold a public hearing on that
 
05:37:29.160 --> 05:37:31.128 align:start position:0%
we could hold a public hearing on that
Amendment

05:37:31.128 --> 05:37:31.138 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:37:34.010 --> 05:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
and if we have given the the seven day
 
05:37:36.830 --> 05:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
notice period And if that would comply
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
new deadlines that the speaker has
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
recently said I will look into that
 
05:37:47.930 --> 05:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
either later today or first thing
 
05:37:49.570 --> 05:37:49.580 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I noticed that no one has
 
05:37:54.288 --> 05:37:54.298 align:start position:0%
their hand up so what I would like to do
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
right now uh if it's okay with everybody
 
05:37:58.368 --> 05:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
is I would like to do
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
a straw poll
 
05:38:04.010 --> 05:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
on your reaction to the new amendment to
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 315.
 
05:38:08.448 --> 05:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a sense of where the
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee would like to go with HP 315
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
it has broad bipartisan support from the
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
people who will actually Implement
 
05:38:19.250 --> 05:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation and Community
 
05:38:19.260 --> 05:38:20.628 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation and Community
power

05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
power
 
05:38:23.690 --> 05:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
and uh as a result of that I would hope
 
05:38:26.270 --> 05:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
that this committee would support it as
 
05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
well but the only way to find out for
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure is uh to do a straw poll so I'm
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to call the roll
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to respond with an
 
05:38:43.010 --> 05:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
answer of yes or no about whether you
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
will support the amendment to House Bill
 
05:38:51.650 --> 05:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
315 as presented this morning I will be
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
using the whole of the roster but I
 
05:38:56.090 --> 05:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
won't be writing it
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
bit of sense yes we just want to get a
 
05:38:58.440 --> 05:39:01.550 align:start position:0%
bit of sense yes we just want to get a
sense

05:39:01.550 --> 05:39:01.560 align:start position:0%

05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
Community is supporting it but also the
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%

05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
the wood industry is
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%

05:41:14.570 --> 05:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
a hole in demand do they have to can

yes they can be on with it they have to
 
05:41:27.170 --> 05:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
be on within 24 hours so the plan has to
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
be more like it's a low running
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
just daily running and they can fire it
 
05:41:32.930 --> 05:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
up within 24 hours
 
05:41:32.940 --> 05:41:34.190 align:start position:0%

05:41:43.788 --> 05:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon I see no more hens raised and
 
05:41:46.730 --> 05:41:46.740 align:start position:0%

ideas

05:41:55.448 --> 05:41:55.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned I thought we were
 
05:41:58.970 --> 05:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
going to talk about a couple of other
 
05:42:02.208 --> 05:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.010 --> 05:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
if you would like to like to do go right
 
05:42:06.830 --> 05:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
ahead well but no honestly I I
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
understand that everybody feels like
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
they would like to get started on on
 
05:42:13.490 --> 05:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
other things but I did think that we
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
might be able to get through a couple of
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
these really with um some alacrity and
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Broadband bill in particular was one
 
05:42:22.490 --> 05:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
that I think our our we might actually
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
be unanimous again because this is
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that our constituents across
 
05:42:29.090 --> 05:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
the board are concerned about whether
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
they're in urban areas or they're in
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
rural areas there's the intermittencies
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
they're the the drop there's not having
 
05:42:37.010 --> 05:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
the speed there are many many issues
 
05:42:39.170 --> 05:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're beyond our ability to talk about
 
05:42:41.930 --> 05:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
in detail within the confines of our own
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee but establishing a group where
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
we would have experts and the companies
 
05:42:50.930 --> 05:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
involved and constituents involved it
 
05:42:52.250 --> 05:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
seems like something that we could just
 
05:42:55.010 --> 05:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
say yes to and and it could go on the
 
05:42:58.250 --> 05:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and we would be able to
 
05:43:00.530 --> 05:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
get it started and off the ground
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
and and the final point about this is
 
05:43:05.208 --> 05:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
that federal funds may be coming in and
 
05:43:08.330 --> 05:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
if things are in progress they may
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
qualify for those funds but if we wait
 
05:43:12.288 --> 05:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
for a year and deal with this in the
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
fall and vote on it in January we may
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
have missed the opportunity entirely
 
05:43:21.170 --> 05:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
well you may be right about uh some of
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
those points but I'll remind you of what
 
05:43:25.550 --> 05:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
we were told at the beginning of the
 
05:43:25.560 --> 05:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
we were told at the beginning of the
year

05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
and that is if it's a study committee or
 
05:43:30.890 --> 05:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
study commission bill and we pass it the
 
05:43:32.448 --> 05:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
Senate will kill it
 
05:43:35.570 --> 05:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
so we would we were advised to retain
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
all study committee bills and that's why
 
05:43:37.680 --> 05:43:39.948 align:start position:0%
all study committee bills and that's why
we

05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
discussed after the public hearing
 
05:43:44.510 --> 05:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
retaining that bill we didn't get around
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
to executing it apparently but we did
 
05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
I'll double check if you would like with
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
the could you do that because things may
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
have changed since then yeah it was just
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
about to say
 
05:44:02.990 --> 05:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
connect with the speaker to see if that
 
05:44:05.868 --> 05:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
situation has changed and if it has then
 
05:44:07.788 --> 05:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
maybe we can go forward with that bill
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
on Monday
 
05:44:12.048 --> 05:44:12.058 align:start position:0%
um but I can't promise you that that
 
05:44:14.530 --> 05:44:14.540 align:start position:0%
will be the case
 
05:44:17.208 --> 05:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
representative appreciate
 
05:44:18.770 --> 05:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
comment thank you
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just wanted to say that I I
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
spoke with a couple of the members of
 
05:44:24.890 --> 05:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
the Senate um the other night we were at
 
05:44:24.900 --> 05:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
the Senate um the other night we were at
a

05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
remote event and they said that they had
 
05:44:30.048 --> 05:44:30.058 align:start position:0%
passed a few study committee bills
 
05:44:31.368 --> 05:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
through them so I don't know if there's
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
a difference between ones originating in
 
05:44:34.970 --> 05:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate and ones originating in the
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
house but
 
05:44:37.610 --> 05:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
um at least it sounded like they weren't
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
wholly opposed to every single study
 
05:44:42.650 --> 05:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee so fingers crossed
 
05:44:44.690 --> 05:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
okay I'll try to get clarification on
 
05:44:44.700 --> 05:44:45.430 align:start position:0%
okay I'll try to get clarification on
that

05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:44:48.110 --> 05:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative fimentel
 
05:44:49.788 --> 05:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just a little bit of that
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotal I've been doing some Southern
 
05:44:54.048 --> 05:44:54.058 align:start position:0%
this year I've subbed in three other
 
05:44:56.530 --> 05:44:56.540 align:start position:0%
committees and all of them are passing
 
05:45:02.448 --> 05:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's good feedback gives me some
 
05:45:08.090 --> 05:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
ammunition to use with the speaker
 
05:45:08.100 --> 05:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
ammunition to use with the speaker
um

05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:11.570 --> 05:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Christian you still have
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
your hand up uh
 
05:45:16.670 --> 05:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
05:45:20.208 --> 05:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative oxenham uh you
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
have the floor if you want to address
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
other bills now uh there's no other
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
oh could could we look in the
 
05:45:30.890 --> 05:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
participants list and see if um
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
representative Weston is here to discuss
 
05:45:37.368 --> 05:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:39.770 --> 05:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble bringing that up is
 
05:45:44.570 --> 05:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
no I don't see her here if she's not on
 
05:45:49.350 --> 05:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
the list of attendees
 
05:45:49.360 --> 05:45:51.230 align:start position:0%
the list of attendees
[Music]

05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the the climate bill is one that it
 
05:45:56.410 --> 05:45:56.420 align:start position:0%
kind of comes right out of our
 
05:45:58.690 --> 05:45:58.700 align:start position:0%
presentation from Des
 
05:46:04.208 --> 05:46:04.218 align:start position:0%
again we we had a major effort in 2009
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
2010 this uh I don't think we need that
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
now I think we understand the science so
 
05:46:11.570 --> 05:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
much better we've had the admissions
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
commission which met from August to
 
05:46:15.770 --> 05:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
December and came out with a
 
05:46:17.570 --> 05:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation that there should be a
 
05:46:20.690 --> 05:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
formal Commission on uh to take that
 
05:46:23.868 --> 05:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
further uh what what this bill would do
 
05:46:26.448 --> 05:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
is uh set some targets which are in line
 
05:46:28.250 --> 05:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
with targets that we're seeing in the
 
05:46:30.890 --> 05:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
surrounding states we were certainly
 
05:46:33.288 --> 05:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
told by Des today that Regional
 
05:46:35.448 --> 05:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
Solutions are the ones that have the
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
greatest impact who've seen the success
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the acid rain effort we've seen the
 
05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
success of the Reggie effort
 
05:46:46.610 --> 05:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
by having an opportunity to go forward
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
with this we would bring ourselves in
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
line with our our neighboring states the
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the goals are quite simple they're
 
05:46:58.270 --> 05:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
available on in the middle of page two
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 22 uh that shall be the
 
05:47:05.628 --> 05:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
public policy of the State of New
 
05:47:07.368 --> 05:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to reduce Statewide greenhouse
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
gas emissions
 
05:47:12.650 --> 05:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
a is at least 20 below 1990 Levels by
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
2025 and I understand that we are on
 
05:47:18.170 --> 05:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
target to meet debt at coming out of the
 
05:47:21.410 --> 05:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
original climate action plan uh to have
 
05:47:25.010 --> 05:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
at least 50 below 1990 Levels by 2035
 
05:47:29.208 --> 05:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
and finally The Net Zero by 2050.
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
so having established those goals by
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
this legislation we would then hand off
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the bill says Des but since the
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
governor has now proclaimed that he's
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
going to establish a department of
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
energy it would be very useful to hand
 
05:47:47.690 --> 05:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
the second part of this which is to draw
 
05:47:50.810 --> 05:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
up the parameters of a plan that plan
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
would then come back to us we would
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
discuss it we would review it we would
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
change it if we felt necessary and then
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
put that into statute so that we would
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
have a Target going forward and that's
 
05:48:08.570 --> 05:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
simply a Target but mechanisms uh that
 
05:48:12.610 --> 05:48:12.620 align:start position:0%
would it says on page let's say three
 
05:48:16.250 --> 05:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
lines nine through twenty just puts out
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a portfolio of things that might
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
be considered to be included within that
 
05:48:21.240 --> 05:48:23.150 align:start position:0%
be considered to be included within that
plan

05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:48:25.610 --> 05:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
um and again at the uh at the bottom of
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
page three it suggests that the
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
department would consult with the Public
 
05:48:31.970 --> 05:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission department of
 
05:48:34.368 --> 05:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
transportation agriculture markets and
 
05:48:38.090 --> 05:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
food at OSI will no longer exist
 
05:48:39.530 --> 05:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
um throughout the plan development
 
05:48:41.930 --> 05:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
process to ensure that these emissions
 
05:48:44.208 --> 05:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
reductions are adopted and implemented
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
in ways that are complementary
 
05:48:48.288 --> 05:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
non-duplicative and
 
05:48:51.530 --> 05:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
in an efficient and cost effective
 
05:48:51.540 --> 05:48:53.590 align:start position:0%
in an efficient and cost effective
manner

05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:48:56.930 --> 05:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
so there's um some subsidiary reporting
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
but that's really that's really it
 
05:49:00.770 --> 05:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's the nub of the bill we've
 
05:49:03.708 --> 05:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
got Target goals and then we're asking a
 
05:49:06.410 --> 05:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
department of the state government
 
05:49:08.208 --> 05:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
which would undoubtedly be the
 
05:49:09.650 --> 05:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
05:49:12.650 --> 05:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
to undertake a planning process and
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
bring that plan back to us I think it's
 
05:49:18.170 --> 05:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh several years down the road on
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
not seeing the date right here in front
 
05:49:21.948 --> 05:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
of me at the moment although it's
 
05:49:26.570 --> 05:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
definitely here by July 1st 2023 the
 
05:49:28.850 --> 05:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
department would bring back after public
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
comment the um
 
05:49:34.570 --> 05:49:34.580 align:start position:0%
prepare an adopt a plan
 
05:49:37.128 --> 05:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
and then review and update every five
 
05:49:37.138 --> 05:49:38.868 align:start position:0%
and then review and update every five
years

05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:49:42.530 --> 05:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
so that's um the broad outlines of that
 
05:49:42.540 --> 05:49:45.770 align:start position:0%
so that's um the broad outlines of that
one

05:49:45.770 --> 05:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative man you're recognized
 
05:49:50.750 --> 05:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah my um thank you Mr chairman my
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
constituents would be very happy with
 
05:49:52.558 --> 05:49:54.048 align:start position:0%
constituents would be very happy with
that

05:49:54.048 --> 05:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:49:57.110 --> 05:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
I think we'd get a lot of positive uh
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
reaction from constituents across the
 
05:50:01.010 --> 05:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
state but doing this
 
05:50:03.730 --> 05:50:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:50:14.930 --> 05:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
I think it's time for us to start the
 
05:50:14.940 --> 05:50:19.250 align:start position:0%
I think it's time for us to start the
weekend

05:50:19.250 --> 05:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
so let's uh let's get started on the
 
05:50:24.048 --> 05:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
weekend we've got a full day of activity
 
05:50:26.868 --> 05:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
planned for just two days from now back
 
05:50:29.830 --> 05:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
