00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
okay call the house rules committee to
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
order and first thing on the agenda it's
 
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
2023 second all those in favor I those
 
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
opposed the eyes have it the second
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
issue is is the deadlines I believe you
 
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
all have a copy of the deadlines in
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
you make a motion to approve them or
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
discussion Senor
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.310 align:start position:0%
discussion Senor
Weber

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I just wanted to
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
raise for
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
discussion um I'm always the person who
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
is trying to get more time for the house
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with the House's bills because
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
we have so
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
many um and I I have sort of my usual
 
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
concern about the short time period to
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
report the house Bills going to a second
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh because that's just January
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
5th to the 15th and often the bills my
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
usual concern about that is that the
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
bills that uh are the biggest most
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
complicated and need to go to two
 
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
committees often come out late I assume
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be an issue this
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
time because we don't have a November
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
drafting period so I assume that we
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
would have all the bills in hand that
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
first week in
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
January uh but the other thing I was
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could pick up a little
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
more time if even if we didn't want to
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
move that one one week later is the
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
issues of the last day to report a house
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
bill not in the second committee which
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
is the huge bulk of our work um that
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
could be moved to march
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
2st with the last Daya act moved to
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
March 28th to give us a little more time
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
to work on that without destroying
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
anything else because this the second
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
committee bills will all be on their
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
way um so I just wanted to put that out
 
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
because I know that we will get to the
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
point next term where um you know I we
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
we literally last this last year had
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
about two weeks to get some of the
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
second committee bills out which was
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
really of concern because there wasn't
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
time for the first committee to do a
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
thorough um
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
review uh so I I would move all four of
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
those first deadlines February 25th 22nd
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
14th and 21st one week later but um
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
particularly the second committee ones
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
which are the the the ones not going to
 
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
a second committee which is the bulk of
 
00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.869 align:start position:0%
a second committee which is the bulk of
our

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
work Mr clerk you Mr Speaker so the
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
difference in the first year and the
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
second year is that all builds have to
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
be introduced by theth January so that
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
comments

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:35.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
the next to start six weeks of of work
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
um regarding the the second committee uh
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
the not the second committee
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
um certainly do will dance
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:07.749 align:start position:0%
 
preference

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I wasn't on the mic sir okay
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
else s
 
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
man so if I understood correctly The
 
00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
man so if I understood correctly The
Proposal

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
Proposal
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
28th question for the clerk does that
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
jam us up on anything that comes
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
after I I don't think so sir the the the
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
issue is that um uh the the following
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
week is the reporting of the early bills
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh the remaining house bills so I I
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see that that's an
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
issue the I would suggest um that
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
although that that becomes a session day
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
for sure uh that that shouldn't prohibit
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
us from meeting in session on the week
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
prior um as you all know uh we have been
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
doing more and more bills um on fewer
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
session days and uh I'm sure that your
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
families and your um dogs probably uh
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't like you being away as long as you
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
have been on those session days uh you
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
know we we do I I do think that we need
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
to be more timely in in the work coming
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
out of the Committees uh in order to
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
have more session days even if we do uh
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday afternoons rather than a full
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
day um if we have 25 bills that that we
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
should try to take up as much in session
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
as we can to to mitigate you know a
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
3-day 600 Bill
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
aside so if I'm correct we're going to
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.350 align:start position:0%
aside so if I'm correct we're going to
move

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to add the
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
28th if if you were ready for a motion I
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
would move that we change the deadline
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
which is March 14th for the last day to
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
report house bills not in a second
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
committee to March
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
21 and then move the March 28th deadline
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
March 20 current March 21st deadline to
 
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
March 20 current March 21st deadline to
the

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
28th um but I would say that I do agree
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
with the clerk that um that does require
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
some management of chairs and committees
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
to get stuff out um you know time was
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
before Co that we normally had a session
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
every single week on Thursday or
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or whichever day it was and
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
chairs no matter who who was in charge
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
were urged to get the bills out so that
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
those could uh get moved along but
 
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's up to the
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
collective wisdom here I don't think I
 
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to make a huge
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
difference either way but it was just
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.030 align:start position:0%
about
second

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
okay are you is are you just moving
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
those two dates or you moving the whole
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
just those two dat okay so we'll take up
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
that then we'll take up the full
 
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.230 align:start position:0%
that then we'll take up the full
calendar

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
favor

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh so now we need a motion to
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
accept the house
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
rules you already have
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
all members of The Rules Committee for
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
allowing us to come in and make this
 
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.069 align:start position:0%
allowing us to come in and make this
request

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
today uh the reason for a late filing uh
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've had meetings with new owners of
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
property in in Coos County in and
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
learned information that we didn't have
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
before uh it's potentially a a large
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
negative impact to Coos County and
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
possibly the rest of the
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
state um is pertaining to Timber taxes
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't know you know how much
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
information you need but that's the
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
reason basically we don't want too much
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
information we just need to know why the
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh the late filing you're asking for the
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
late filing yes for in we we've learned
 
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
late filing yes for in we we've learned
new

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
information say something
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr Speaker the we're
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
talking about the headwaters property in
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh to start with it's 140,000
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
acres and uh it'll have a a as M
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative Davis said a a true
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
impact to start with in Kos County but
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be Statewide to do with u Timber
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
tax Recreation and U really our our
 
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
tax Recreation and U really our our
culture

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
so it's we need a little more time this
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
we've had meetings with them over the
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
last couple
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
weeks since the the filing deadline and
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
we really feel this is imperative to
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
continue on sen
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
Weber actually Mr Speaker I think you
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
just answered my question what I was
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask was the timing of when you
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
learned uh new information about this
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
situation and you said you had um
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussions over the last couple of
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
that is correct we've had uh
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative Davis myself had some
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
private meetings with the new land
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
owners and there was a public meeting
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
about 10 days ago and every time we meet
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
questions pres bosor thank you uh if
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're still in the process of gathering
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
new information are you even ready to
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
I believe so I uh we've been looking
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
into it we weren't ready to put in a
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
bill but in light of of new information
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
is I think something needs to be done
 
00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:42.910 align:start position:0%
is I think something needs to be done
fairly

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
soon forther question thank you um and
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
so you would say that this is an an
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
emergency situation that cannot wait
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
so also this is a not a partisan piece
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation the whole County
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
delegation is involved with this and of
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
file okay we have a first and a second
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
discussion got to call the rooll on this
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
McGuire right thank you Mr
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker um my request is to be allowed
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
to violate house rule
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
36e which is the one that um prevents
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
you if a bill has been retained or or um
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise considered in the first year
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
to to allow it to be resubmitted in the
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
second year and the bill in question was
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
my own bill uh House Bill 593 I have I
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
brought a copy in case anybody wanted to
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
look at it um uh relative to the
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of Assets in connection with
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
the drug offense um which uh has to do
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
with RSA 318b col
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
17b and so uh what happened with this
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
bill was that it was um sent to the
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee it had its
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
public well first of all we created the
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I did extensive work with the
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh we met with
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
the representative of the Judiciary um
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn help me draft it Etc
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
um and also outside groups it's it's of
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
interest to the uh ACLU the AFP um
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice and so on um so we
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
did all that and we thought we had sort
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
of agreement among all those parties but
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
what we discovered in the public hearing
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
was the J Judiciary in particular was
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
not on board with this bill and so um
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
partly because of that and partly
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
because this is a complex bill
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
it was retained by the criminal justice
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee and so over the
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
summer um uh we met with the Chief
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
Justice and with um members of his staff
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
and discovered what the problem was with
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
them was had to do with the way the bill
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
didn't comport with their computer
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
system and and had the bill passed in
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
its original form it would have required
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
them to spend a lot of money on custom
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
software so we worked out way a way to
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
meet our policy goals but not cause that
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
problem to to to be compliant with the
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
way their software works and so you know
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
that took a fair amount of time and and
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
we worked out new language for the bill
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
and so I came to September when the
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
retain Bill committee you know the
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee was going to have its retained
 
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.149 align:start position:0%
committee was going to have its retained
Bill

00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:56.270 align:start position:0%
Bill
hearing

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
and I could have just sort of dumped a
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
new 12-page Amendment or something on
 
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.029 align:start position:0%
new 12-page Amendment or something on
them

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
but at in the meantime I had come up
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
with the idea of splitting the bill into
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
three pieces number one to make it
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
slightly more manageable number two to
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
make it more likely that certain pieces
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
would pass because there's objections to
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
part of the bill but not to the whole
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
bill you know
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
not there's a certain part of the bill
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
very small that that has considerable
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
objections um from law
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but I don't think that
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
applies to the bulk of the bill and and
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
also there
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
different the re reason we originally
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
had one bill was it all affects one RSA
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
this one small this one section but in
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
reality there's parts that are Financial
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's parts that have to do with
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
courtroom practice and there's parts
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
that have to do with state and federal
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
relations and so um it really in my mind
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be correct to have it as three
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
pieces and not as one big piece and it
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
would enhance the the we have to think
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
not just of passing the house but but of
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know passing and and uh being
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
enacted into law and I think it would
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
enhance at least some part of the bill
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
becoming law so
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
um and then the reason for um so that's
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
my request I so I asked the the criminal
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
justice committee please find this bill
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
um interim study they and this was my
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
plan and they agreed that that was
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and so um I think that's
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to House Bill 593
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to be interim
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
study um and then the question of well
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
why not just wait another year well this
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill involves Justice right this bill
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
involves um you know it's it's not a lot
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
of people um a lot of accused and so on
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
but it's some and so you know there's no
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
reason to wait um for you know for
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
justice to be done
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
basically thank
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm a little concerned about the
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of this seems to be the
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
result of choices that were made with
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
respect to an existing Bill and a lot of
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
what you're arguing to us is that it
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to bring in
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
something large and cumbersome without
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
benefit of another hearing and I agree
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
with you entirely on that but there's no
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
reason why you couldn't have another
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
hearing now and get public input
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
particularly on amendment that would
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
have the pieces that you think are
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
particularly appropriate to go forward
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
but the rest of it sounds to me like
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that's been under consideration
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and is a matter of
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
tactics yes thank you for the question
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative when you say I'm I guess
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure when you say we could
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
have another public hearing now do you
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
mean the um subcommittee of Criminal
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
Justice that's dealing with this bill
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
could create the a new public hearing
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
Etc yes um with with if I may clarify it
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
could either be a subcommittee or it
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
could be a working uh session of the
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
full committee and all you have to do is
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh with reference to it in the
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
calendar so that's perfectly doable and
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's a laudable goal uh that
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
could be done within the existing
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
framework yes thank you um okay that
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
that is possible the the main the other
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of it in terms of timing are
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we worked extensively with a member
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
of the AG's office who has since um left
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the AG and went into private practice
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
and so I would kind of like a little bit
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
of time to Circle back with them and get
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh new input on our on our
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
changes prior to showing them to the
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
legislature and so um the timing doesn't
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
quite work uh for that in my opinion um
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
and also I'm I'm
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
just I'm I'm enthusiastic
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
about breaking breaking up the bill um
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
because I think that make it easier both
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
on the legislature and on the members of
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
the public who are interested in certain
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
thing thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative just so I'm clear in my
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
own mind has the full committee met to
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh vote up and down on this bill as far
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
as I know
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
no follow up for the question would um
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense to go to
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
that committee when they do take it up
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
for their final disposition of the bill
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh to ask him to uh with the
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations you're going to make to
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
allow it to go forward yeah thank you
 
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.630 align:start position:0%
allow it to go forward yeah thank you
but

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
again I think the changes are more
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
substantial than the committee would
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
want to consider over this short period
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
of time that's that's the issue
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
um so so in my
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
opinion it's it's too put it's too
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
rushed because they're going to have to
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.510 align:start position:0%
 
weeks

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
man um two questions if that's allowed U
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
have they already EXA 593 or not the
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has with with my
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation of interim study and it
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
was unanimous but the but the full
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
committee has not thank you follow up
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
question the um so the three bills
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
you're proposing are they drafted
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
already yes I have them here okay
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
through o ol
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
no so you also want late drafting an
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
introduction yes I asked when I when I
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
asked to be on your agenda was during
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
the week of um uh where we were
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
submitting bills but and I asked should
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
I go to OS and have them say to me well
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
you can't P you know these are the same
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
as your other previous Bill and they and
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
I was told no that there was no
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
that further
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions osbor yeah I mean I was just
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
going to get in on the same topic here
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
if there these changes are so
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
significant uh I I was just wondering
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
why they weren't filed during
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
in my opinion they violate house rule
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
36e okay
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
they're the the subject of the bill a
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
lot of the contents of the bill are the
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
same as House Bill 593 two of the bills
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
two of the small pieces that I want to
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
break off are the same that they're not
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
changed the the structure of the bulk of
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is is somewhat changed
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
but I mean I I can get into the details
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
but if you really want but but basically
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
um what happens now in law is that um
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
the asset forfeiture case is a civil
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
case and the and the um there's an
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
underlying drug offense criminal case
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
all right the bill House Bill 593
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
combines those into one single criminal
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
case that's what caused problems for the
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
judiciary's computer system was having
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
these two kinds of things be under one
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
case so our new approach that we are
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
doing with
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
them keeps them
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
split but has a lot of timing aspects
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
merges how they proceed and
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
so you know in my opinion it's it's
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
you know this is all the same subject
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's it's it's and so in my
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
opinion it does violate House Bill 36e
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion that's what you know
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
discussion and
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn came to you know
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
support this request I don't know if you
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.190 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
speaker um it's it's helpful to have
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
some idea what we're talking about but
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to remind everybody that
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
we only discuss the reasons for the late
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
drafting or the difference you know the
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
departure for the rules we don't delve
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
into the underlying
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.830 align:start position:0%
into the underlying
context

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
Smith and if I understand correctly you
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
believed that you weren't going to be
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to get these submitted until you
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
came to our next
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
meeting yes
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
well I had experience with
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
OS turning down a request for for an LSR
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
on the basis of similarity with a
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
previous Bill and and in my opinion
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
those two were not at all similar and so
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
in this case I was certain that they
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
were going to find these similar right
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
so follow up follow up trying to help
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
so you you're you need the late drafting
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
because you wanted to come here first
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
because you believed that there was
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue and just wanted the
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
ruling body to deal with it yes thank
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
ruling body to deal with it yes thank
you

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.950 align:start position:0%
you
Senor

00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
Senor
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
Weber but I am clear that you did not in
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
the first instance go to OS and ask them
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
if they would do that drafting or argue
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
with them as any number of people have
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
done this term and other terms about
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
whether their decision was appropriate
 
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.590 align:start position:0%
whether their decision was appropriate
or

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
not I certainly did that in the case of
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
my other
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
Bill not with this bill no because in
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
again in my mind this one is much
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
others sen shot would a motion be an
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
order I'd move that we not Grant the
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
permission to file a late Bill if I just
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
speak proy to the motion with all due
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
respect to my friend from Epsom I hate
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
to set the president in this body that
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're allowing somebody to file a new
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
bill while the standing committee still
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
has possession of the old bill and has
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
an adjudication ated it or acted on it
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
and secondly i' as a member from um
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
cheser County said I'd rather see it go
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
back to uh OSS and file three separate
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
bills and let let OS and eventually
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
maybe the speaker make a decision if
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's enough changes to have it go
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Mr
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker further discussion I would just
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
second for for discussion the motion of
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
my friend from
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
discussion I just wanted to point out a
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
further inconsistency I mean one of the
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that was raised was this is a
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
matter of justice and they don't want to
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
wait until next year because it's a
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
matter of justice but on the same but
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
they're also arguing that they don't
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to do it quickly so
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think that gets us in a bit of a
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
bind and I I really think it's an awful
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
you if there's no further discussion
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%

of a bill with the same language as
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
626 from this past um uh 2023 session
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%

the close of the filing period my
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
remarks um this afternoon are attended
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
to lay out the facts and the
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
justification behind this request for
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
background House Bill 626 for the most
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
part shifts administration of the
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program from a
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
third party to the Department of
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
Education according to the Bill's docket
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 626 was introduced in the
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
2023 session and was referred to the
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
education committee on February 14th
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
2023 it came to the house floor with no
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation and was voted ought to
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
pass 183 to 180 and referred to the
 
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.710 align:start position:0%
pass 183 to 180 and referred to the
finance

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee then on April 6
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
2023 the bill came back from the finance
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee and on the house floor a
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
motion of itl was adopted on a roll roll
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
call vote of 19 5 to 194 with the chair
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard participating by voting
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes on the itl
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
motion leading up to the LSR filing
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
period September 11 through 15 2023 I
 
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
had conversations with the ranking
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
member on education and leader Wilhelm
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh and was advised that I could not
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
refile this bill for the 2024 session
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
because house rules bar introduction of
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in the second year uh of a
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
session that was voted itl in the first
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
um in the first
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
year and that's where we thought the
 
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
year and that's where we thought the
story

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
ended but on September 18th 2023 3 days
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
after closing of the LSR filing period
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office received a letter
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general concluding
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
that house member uh that uh House
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
member and state state representative
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
Troy mner was not domiciled in the
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
district that he was elected to
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
represent at any time during the 2023
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
session in violation of State Statute
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution so let's go back to the
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
disposition of House Bill
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
626 the it the itl vote back in April
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
was a roll call vote and representative
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
mner participated it participated in it
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
voting yes to the itl motion based on
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's investigation
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's clear that rep M's vote was
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
illegitimate and without M's vote the
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to ask the committee to
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
allow for the late filing of an LSR with
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
the same language as House Bill 626 that
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about with the effective
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
date adjusted by one year house rules
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
permit this committee to approve the
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
late filing and introduction of
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
legislation quote based on urgent or
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
compelling need or events unforeseen
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
prior to the filing deadline and it was
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
not known that the
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
disposition of H b626 was illegitimate
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
until after the close of the filing
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
period upon examination of The house's
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
votes uh from this year there were
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
likely many motions in which rep M's uh
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
vote affected the
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
outcome but in the case of House Bill
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
626 a roll call vote shows that R mner
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
specifically enabled an itl motion to be
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
adopted this is an important bill to
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
many members of the
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
House as its multiple strong votes
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
indicate had it been laid on the
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
table or otherwise stalled but not found
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
itl it would have been refiled for this
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
year clearly this is an event unforeseen
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
as the house did not know until the LSR
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
filing period was over that the
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
disposition of house bill 626's itl was
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
not legitimate and should not have
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
barred its filing for the 2024 session I
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask the rules to support the request for
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
late filing so that we can rectify the
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.309 align:start position:0%
 
bluno

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay if there no being no questions I'd
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
motion I would move to allow for the
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
motion after the second count thank you
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
for finishing my sentence there I'll
 
00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:06.270 align:start position:0%
for finishing my sentence there I'll
second

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
it um Mr chairman uh first of all I
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
consider still today Troy Mard I think a
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
lot of us in this room do is a good
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
friend regardless of whatever happens to
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
him in the future but um I think on this
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
instance with this was a tie vote on the
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
motion to itl and his being not a
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
resident of his
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
district and if you can believe half of
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
what you read in the paper is the
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
comments made that he knew full well
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
that he wasn't supposed to vote that he
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
was not living in
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
Lancaster um I find I do find that
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat agreed just very much so and I
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
think he had an impact on the outcome of
 
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.390 align:start position:0%
think he had an impact on the outcome of
this

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
vote and I would think under those
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the house was so
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
evenly divided on this question that to
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
allow the member to to file again under
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
these circumstances would be the
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing in the and in the best
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
interest of the house tradition of uh
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
fness and
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh right doing in all circumstances so
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker F discussion sen
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
 
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
Speaker

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
so one that we think we know about I
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
don't know when representative murder
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
stop using the apartment in Lancaster I
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't know when representative hatch
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
moved to Bedford um a couple of years
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
ago I don't know when a representative
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
who moved out and then got elected in a
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
new District left they didn't resign in
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
the middle they were serving I'll use
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the word that's been brought up
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
illegitimately unless they moved on
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
organization day we hear rumors about
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
these things all the time um so if I can
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
find one other representative serving
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
illegitimately do we then come back to
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
this body and undo this
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
vote I don't like the cycle of getting
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
into that and going back to try to find
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
ways to redo
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
it for other discussion Senator sh um GL
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
be it for me to disagree with my friend
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
from Charlestown but in this instance I
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with my friend from Charlestown
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think we do know from what the
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
attorney general has told but even more
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
we know from the comments made by
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative mner and the union leader
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
and other uh newspapers the fact that he
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
knew for six months that he was no
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
longer living at his residence uh the AG
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
said in their report that he had moved
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
out of uh Lancaster the apartment
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
building he had he just had an office
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
there but he was living in Carol in um
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
Coos County uh and that he had been out
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
of that district for quite some time as
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
far as my friend Bill hatch I know we
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
all know and we miss his service in this
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
house and on the finance committee we
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
know he has been ill for quite some time
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
of course he's been out of the district
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
he was in Connecticut for a while
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
because of his illness uh and knowing
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
Bill I know he's a man of ethics and
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
would not do anything
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate contrary to the rules of
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
this body but I think in as far as Mr M
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative murer as I've said he
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
stated in the press that he was out of
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
this dist out of his district for six
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
months mon but the fact he mentioned
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
that other members of the House have
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
done the same thing and I think all of
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
in this room know that members of the
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
House have not done that same thing that
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
we take pride in representing at
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
districts and we've had members resigned
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
because they've moved one town over so
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
with all uh good faith and my friend
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
from Charleston I disagree with the
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr Speaker govern
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
wber thank you and following on from the
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
comments of my friend from
 
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.870 align:start position:0%
comments of my friend from
Penacook

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
Penacook
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
um this is an extraordinary set of facts
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
in this case there and and the issues of
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
residence and domicile are difficult and
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
murky I know we had a member for example
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
whose house burned down and he could not
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
therefore live in the house that was not
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
there anymore and during the course of
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
rebuilding the house he stayed in place
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
that might not have been in his district
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
but his intent was always to return so
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
and intent
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
is a legal portion of the
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
inquiry um this case
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
is particularly clear in that the
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative himself made certain
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
allegations it's certain representations
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
at certain times that made things much
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
clearer than they are when somebody is
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with a difficult
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
situation we've always taken these
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
matters one at a time and looked at the
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
individual facts and I think we have in
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
the past made real accommodations for
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
people who were dealing with
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties of one sort or another the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
other distinguishing factor of course is
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
that representative hatch was not here
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
to vote on anything so there's
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
not when he had already when he stated
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
that he had already when he later stated
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
that he had already moved so I I think
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
these should be taken one at a time I I
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
agree that they should not set a
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
precedent for every single thing but I
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
think that we have uh the the issue is
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
looking at each case individually and
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
this case uh is far more clear than many
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the other cases that we have seen
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
Smith so other things that I know
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
happened a recently not this term a
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative elected rolling around
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over a year without
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
estate plates because they had just
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
moved here so I would just ask you to
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
ask yourselves do you believe they were
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
serving him properly because they were
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
resident of another state or do you
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
believe that they were willfully
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
violating our Motor Vehicle Laws because
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
those are the only two
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
options there's a lot to look into in
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
these I agree with you but let's go back
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the procedure part of it can this not
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
be filed for 2025 is it that urgent is
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
there no bill sitting around that an
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
amendment could go on with a little
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
Artful authoring it's usually possible
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
to get what you want out of a bill
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
tagged on to another other one there
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
must be some other way to accomplish it
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
than for the rules committee to do this
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
essentially saying publicly that we're
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
undoing a vote on the house floor which
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
discussion hey the motion before us is
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
to accept the uh late filing cler will
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%

five

00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker uh for the
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Lucy Weber I represent
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
chesher 5 which is the Connecticut River
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
Town of um mple I'm sorry I have to
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
think a little hard I've represented 11
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
cheser County towns over the course of
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
my service
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
here so what I want to ask for the
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
permission to
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
draft um out untimely also arises out of
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
the issues surrounding the Attorney
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
General's letter that that was received
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
by the speaker on September
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
18th in that letter uh what I would like
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
to do is draft a bill so you know where
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this that would require
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to notify the
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
house as soon as they get some kind of
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
confirmation that a member may be
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
sitting who is not residing in the
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
district where they're supposed to
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
be and I know that this has been raised
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
the problem was that representative mner
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
made represent present ations to the
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in May and the
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
letter did not come to the speaker until
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
September at during which time many
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
votes were taken which we all now view
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
with certain degrees of problem
 
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.270 align:start position:0%
with certain degrees of problem
problematical

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
problematical
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
anyway the what I am
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
proposing the Attorney General when when
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
people said why did you wait so long the
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General responded that they did
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
not their office did not want to
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
compromise a criminal
 
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
investigation and if you recall the
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
letter from September 18th there was a
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
significant amount that had to do with
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
the membership in the house which the
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
Attorney General acknowledged was a
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
matter for us to consider but there was
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
also a significant amount of that letter
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
that had to do with their criminal
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
investigation and where it had arrived
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
and what I want to do is to try and
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
separate out very clearly those two
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
issues for the Attorney General's office
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
should this bizarre situation arise
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
again um and what I would like to do is
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
be able to draft a bill that requires
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
office when and and the actual wording
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill can be entirely up in the
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
air until it goes to a committee and and
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
is discussed
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
but I want this body to be notified as
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
soon as there
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
is a determination or possibly just
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
credible evidence and again that's to be
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
discussed later on about some knowledge
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's has about
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's residing elsewhere other than
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
where they were elected from and I want
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
to separate it out very narrowly because
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm want to make it very clear that the
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
only thing we are asking to be informed
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
of is the residence issue which is only
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
for this house to
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
decide and
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
any issues other than that that may lead
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
to a criminal investigation would be
 
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.109 align:start position:0%
to a criminal investigation would be
well

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
outside of anything that the Attorney
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
General is required to con convey to us
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
we certainly would respect their part of
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
the process just as I think they should
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
respect our part of the process so
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
that's my proposal for late
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
drafting again it you know it all arose
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
after the drafting period and and um I
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
would hope that what we would have is an
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the house to take a good
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
look at this situation in a public forum
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
and for the Attorney General also in a
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
public forum to have the opportunity to
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
discuss with us the concerns that they
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
have uh so that we could come up with
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
some uh clear and meaningful legislation
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
going forward as guidance as to whose
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are are which in this
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
issue that is so entangled with issues
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
of separation of powers so thank you for
 
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.150 align:start position:0%
of separation of powers so thank you for
your

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.349 align:start position:0%
your
consideration

00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
SM thank you so I'm confused about what
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
it would actually do so allow me a
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and this is not based on
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
any actual person so a serving
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative who based on his tan and
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
social media post appears to live in
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
Florida I'm sorry if that resembles
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
anyone so I put in a request the
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to see if this wellan
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
and funloving individual is actually
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
living in Florida 80% of the time or as
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire resident what happens
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
next well my understanding of residents
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
which dates from law school which I
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
intended in the late stone age uh
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
because I have avoided sitting on the
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
election law committee has an aspect of
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
intent and it's going to be an
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
individual inquiry in every single
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
single case but I think this is one of
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the things that ought to be discussed
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
thoroughly in committee as to whether
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has a
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to report to us only when
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
they have confirmed that the individual
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
is not living in their District or
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
whether they need to report to us when
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
there are concerns in your
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical if there's stuff all over
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
the internet that could give rise to an
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry I think there's all kinds of
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
aspects we certainly had a case of a
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative who's reputed not to be
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
living in his district and uh that was
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
sent to the legislative Administration
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee which I believe actually voted
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
to recommend to the Full House that he
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
be removed from the
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
house and uh that recommendation should
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
have been taken up at the next house
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
session but because that member
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
presented to the then speaker a signed
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
lease uh that the then speaker decided
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
that that was mooded and I think that
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's an incorrect decision because I
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't think you get it's not a matter of
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
whether you get tagged off base the
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution doesn't give you a right to
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
cure the Constitution says when you
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
leave the seat is vacated and so my
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
argument that case would be um if if if
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
they don't have the backup they don't
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
have the backup and whatever you're
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
you're postulating is is also available
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
to everybody uh I certainly didn't have
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
any way of knowing where the
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative was was living or what
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
his living situation was and I think
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that ought to have been
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
communicated to the house and I think
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
that anytime we have that concern the
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
house can take it up as a matter of its
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
own responsibility and has the duty to
 
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.069 align:start position:0%
own responsibility and has the duty to
do

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
that uh because I think that is our duty
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
to make inquiry into those
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
situations uh but again this is a very
 
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.470 align:start position:0%
situations uh but again this is a very
specific

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
situation and I think it would be
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a clearer delineation of
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
what the responsibilities are and as I
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
said I would I would draft a bill with
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
some selections that I might might make
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
but I would offer that entirely in the
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
spirit of having the house thoughtfully
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and carefully deliberate with input from
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
everybody involved as to what the best
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
way of dealing with this kind of
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.870 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
senat thank you Mr Speaker as I
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
understand what you said what your bill
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
would do would require the Attorney
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
General once they real realize that a
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
member of the house is living somewhere
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
other than the district to notify the
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
speaker notify the
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
house that's correct I have do have a
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
concern with that and we know the
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
members of the House get in trouble and
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think our friend from Windam sitting
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
behind you was in the US attorney's
 
00:56:15.029 --> 00:56:15.039 align:start position:0%
office when a majority leader from the
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house was arrested on
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
federal charges if that had been a state
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
invested well I'm not going to mention
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
the name but it's on the plaque out in
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
the if you want to look at it on your
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
way out um if that had been a state
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
investigation and they were
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
investigating him on some of the
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
criminal offense and realize that uh he
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
was living somewhere else in the state
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
or somewhere else all together maybe
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
Florida um under this law they would be
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
required to notify the house that the
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
person was no longer living in the
 
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
district and therefore jeopardizing
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
their case by notifying their target
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they were investigating their
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
because that's how the information got
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
house well in the first place the the
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
bill that I was contemplating only spoke
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office not to
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
Federal authorities the Attorney
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
General's office but I'm oh well you
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
spoke of a federal investigation and I'm
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
um there there isn't a need
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
to compromise a criminal investigation
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
because the only thing that needs to be
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
communicated to the house is the
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
fact of residents or non-residents not
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.710 align:start position:0%
fact of residents or non-residents not
anything

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
else and nobody has to discuss with the
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
house why they were investigating that
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
it could have been a complaint filed by
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
a constituent such as the town clerk
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
here uh and and the Attorney General's
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
office could make it very clear that
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
they were not going to discuss the
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
source of the complaint and I think
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be a very good
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
suggestion for the bill that they not
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances discuss the
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
source of the complaint follow question
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
instead of a legis piece of legislation
 
00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:26.039 align:start position:0%
could not the speaker off into into a
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
meming of understanding with the
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general that we be notified if
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
when they feel at an appropriate
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
time the the person has moved out of the
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
district if it comes to their attention
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
I can see where could jeopardize the
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
case if all of a sudden the speaker is
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
getting a letter from um the Attorney
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
General saying we know this person is
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
left and of course that person will turn
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
around and file Freedom of Information
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
Act uh saying where did you get this
 
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.710 align:start position:0%
Act uh saying where did you get this
information

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
possibly well I don't think that Freedom
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
of Information Act necessarily is going
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
to be successful because of certain
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
exceptions but this is why we don't go
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
into the underlying specifics of the
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
bill and my point would be I would like
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
to have the bill introduced and it may
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
be that upon introduction and after a
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and after
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
discussion it may be determined that
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
there is no way
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
to do that appropriately but I think
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
that the place to have that discussion
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
is out in the open with all of the
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire house and
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
the public being able to
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
participate and
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
not in a closed memorandum between the
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
speaker and the Attorney General's
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
office because it is a matter that
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
affects all of us as house members and
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
all of the members of the public in
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
terms of representation so so as I say I
 
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.870 align:start position:0%
terms of representation so so as I say I
make

00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
no representations about whether I would
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
even vote for the bill at the end of it
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
I may be
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
persuaded that there is no way to draft
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
such an issue but I think it ought to be
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
drafted I think it ought to be discussed
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that ought to be done by the
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
this house as a way of keeping its house
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
in order rather than by a memor random
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
of one person to the Attorney General's
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
office um so as I say I'm I'm I'm not
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
taking a position on how we would come
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
out on It ultimately it may be that
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct that we would
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
determine that there uh the risks would
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
be too great if there was a criminal
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
investigation but I think that's a
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
decision that the Full House ought to
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
make and that's why I'm asking that it
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
drafted further
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
discuss sen wman I just going to make
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
the motion to accept late drafting
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
second okay motion has been
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
discussion Willam thank you Mr Speaker I
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the the the motion here uh
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
and and hopeful that this can be a a
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort as we work its way
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
through the committee process into the
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
house floor um you know I think we know
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
that we have a constitutional
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh to make sure that our
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
members meet the
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh for office and uh
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
figuring out you
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
know what we can do moving forward uh to
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
maintain the Integrity of the
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
institution uh would go a long way
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
thanks further discussion sen of not
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I was getting
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
confused and I'm trying to to wrap my
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
head around this because when you first
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
started talking it sounded to me like
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
you want people to be presumed guilty
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
until they're proven innocent but then
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
you said it it has to be investigated
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
first but that's what happened um I
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
wrote down you said something about may
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
they started investigating in May and it
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
was they came out with their letter in
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
September which is what happened so I
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
don't see the need for this right now
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
and I just don't feel comfortable voting
 
01:02:27.559 --> 01:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
and I just don't feel comfortable voting
for

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
discussion General bosor uh yeah so I I
 
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.990 align:start position:0%
discussion General bosor uh yeah so I I
am

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
am
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh I don't imagine that this bill is
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go anywhere and be
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
able to overcome the objections that
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative brought forward but um
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did U very clearly
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
indicate why this was uh new information
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
had come to light and that uh there
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
could be um other circumstances that
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
this would affect over the next year and
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
so it is timely and uh it should be
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
I'll will be honest I'm conflicted
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
one I get I get what you're asking for
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just a little
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
um going back to representative short
 
01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
um going back to representative short
lft's

01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that once that
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
letter came to us which was between 400
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and 4:30 in the afternoon on
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
Monday um even though I was on the phone
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
first thing in the morning telling
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative we I representative mner
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
that he had to resign uh that letter was
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
out you know it was out there and all
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
the information was in
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
it and that that concerns me if there is
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
further criminal investigation in the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
letter that you know was submitted to
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
us um and that's why I'm so
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
conflicted and may I answer
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
um here's the thing um there was no
 
01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
um here's the thing um there was no
necessity

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
for three and a half of those four
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
Pages all the Attorney General needed to
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
have said was Mr Speaker we became aware
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
on X date that this was a fact and in
 
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.950 align:start position:0%
on X date that this was a fact and in
that

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
case the representative had stated to
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
the attorney general where they was
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
living so it was not a near thing or a
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
question of intent or anything else he
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
stated that it was his intention to
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
finish out his term even though he
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
didn't live there and the Constitution
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
says you can't do that so the concerns
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
expressed one of the reasons that I want
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
this drafted is to make it clear that
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General need not put all of
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
that into a letter I mean he did because
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
he wanted to make a particular case to
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
the house and that was his decision and
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
that was perfectly Fair what I want to
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
get at is the fact that that you acted
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
immediately after you received that
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
letter but the the
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge that he was not living in his
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
district was
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
available at a minimum in
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
May and you were not informed of it and
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
the house was not informed of it so it
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
was not available to be acted on
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
and as a result a member who had stated
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
that he was not
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
living in his district had voted
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
multiple times and that's something I
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
really want to avoid for us going
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
forward so all I'm trying to do is move
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the notification
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
Point uh because you're absolutely right
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
once that letter was out there it was
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
out there but what I'm trying to do is
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
both limit what is in the not
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
notification to Simply the fact of where
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
the representative is
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
living and make sure that there isn't a
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
lapse of five months while a whole
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
investigation is going on during which
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
time somebody is voting without the
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
authority of the Constitution because
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
the Constitution says that your
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative ceases
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
immediately and so that Tim
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
flag is one that is
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because in this case
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
just in this case it would be very
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
different in any other
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
case um the member was aware he may not
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
have been aware of the provisions of the
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution but the member was aware of
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
where he was living and and had a
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
particular view on it
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
so the reason that I think we ought to
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
have a buil to explore all of this is to
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
explore how to appropriately limit if
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
possible a
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
notification to whom that notification
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
is sent to the speaker to the speaker
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
and the minority and the majority
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
leaders to the legislative
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Administration committee um to the
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
entire house but I think those are
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
things that I would love to see
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
discussed in public public to see if we
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
can come to a reason
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion that would satisfy and
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
because this situation was allowed to
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
persist for a long time with people
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
knowing that something that was
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
violating our constitution on a regular
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
basis was happening and the house was
 
01:08:53.159 --> 01:08:54.309 align:start position:0%
basis was happening and the house was
not

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
given that information to be able to
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
deal with it and you know maybe maybe
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
there were people who knew things and
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
should have talked to other members of
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
the house about them and you know that's
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
too bad
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't know anybody knew and I I
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't know who knew what and when and
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
and uh in other cases it has usually
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
happened in other cases when a member
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't been living in the district
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has made a complaint to us
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
rather than to the Attorney General's
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
office and the house has undertaken its
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
own investigation which is what the
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
house ought to be doing and I just want
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can get that
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
information as quickly as humanly
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
possible and as I said it it may be that
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that we
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
decide is not something we can draft
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
around and and I'm perfectly okay with
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
that but I think I think I think it's a
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
matter that this house ought to take up
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then you know people can vote
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
however they they feel about the result
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
if if a committee is able to come up
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
with something that they feel is
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate then great if the committee
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
believes and the house believes that
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is in inexpedient to legislate we
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
have a vote for that um which is why I
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr Speaker we're getting
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
way into the weeds of a bill that
 
01:10:30.679 --> 01:10:32.030 align:start position:0%
way into the weeds of a bill that
doesn't

01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
exist the the simple question is as my
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
friend from Walpole said why she needs
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
late drafting she did that satisfies me
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation that can happen
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
so I mean why
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
question l go call a roll the motion is
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
to allow late drafting represent
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
so see we've had such a good discussion
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
or yes
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
um when must I have something to OS
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
buy uh thank you representative
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
typically after this meeting I go over
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
to OS and inform them that uh that the
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
late draftings have been approved um
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
usually we don't have a steadfast rule
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
in this however usually we we try to do
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
it within a week or so oh absolutely
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
any is there any other business to come
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
before us just just to clarify Mr
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker does allow for late drafting it
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
it the same deadlines however for sign
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
offs do apply so that's uh and just a
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
quick reminder uh as we uh undertook in
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
our spring meeting um the late drafting
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
has already been approved uh by statuto
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
 
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.229 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
Speaker

01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
so there have been questions in my short
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
tenure in the house of 12 or 13 years
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
about when part two article seven of the
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution applies that's the one
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
about not taking fees or acting as
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
counsel to advocate for a cause before
 
01:13:01.639 --> 01:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
counsel to advocate for a cause before
the

01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislature it might interest you to
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
know that over a hundred years ago the
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
house had a rule defining this so that
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't actually have to fight with
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
each other about what it actually means
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
and whether or not some group paying you
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
a salary to then come here and file
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
bills for them qualifies I think it does
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
some disagree with me so what I would
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
ask is this is a solution that has to be
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the house and not a political fight
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
if there is any member of the other
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
party that would work with me on
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
drafting a rule such as this to uh the
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
old words from the early 1800s were be
 
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.189 align:start position:0%
old words from the early 1800s were be
fully

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
fully
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
explanatory of Article 2 part 7 sadly we
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't have that rule anymore and then it
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
would have applied to lawyers and then
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know the that was their worst fear
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
then because they didn't know what
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
lobbyists were but yet here they are
 
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.149 align:start position:0%
lobbyists were but yet here they are
sorry

01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
guys so um you don't have to answer now
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
but it would be great if we could get a
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan drafting of when part two
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
article 7 requires you to forfeit your
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
seat it's a very short article and that
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
is the penalty and I believe it I know
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
of at least three cases where it was
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
violated I mean we don't want to get to
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the point right where the NRA or Planned
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
Parenthood or the New Hampshire
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association or anybody even if
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's a group we like decides it's a
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
really good business model so pay
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
someone a salary so they can come on in
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
here and file bills and be in inside the
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
house Advocate that should never happen
 
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion so um I would ask
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
you to consider that thank you Mr
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
Speaker is there any other business that
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
come before
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
come before
us

01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
I
