00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
hereditarily self-appointed or elective
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
may be justly pronounced the very
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
definition of tyranny AR a 440 5 was
 
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
never intended to dive the citizens of
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
this state into a prolonged and definite
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
state of emergency nor was it intended
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
to hand the executive branch unlimited
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
Authority with the ability to suspend
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
statute the Constitution and civil
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
liberties but unfortunately while that
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
was not the spirit of the law the result
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
in this current state of emergency has
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
been just that unlimited Authority
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
delivered to the executive branch with
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
no oversight quote promise pay a
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
constitution defines and limits the
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
powers of the government it creates it
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
therefore follows as a natural and also
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
a logical result that the governmental
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
exercise of any power not authorized by
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
the Constitution is an assumed power and
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
therefore illegal part one article 29 of
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state constitution
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
says the powers of suspending the laws
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
or the execution of them ought never to
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
be exercised but by the legislature or
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
by Authority derived there from to be
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
exercised in such particular cases only
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
as the legislature May expressly provide
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
for RSA 445 does not expressly provide
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
the executive branch with the ability to
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
suspend statute but in this state of
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency it has been an assumed power
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
part one article 37 of the New Hampshire
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
state constitution reads in the
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%

legislative executive and judicial ought
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
to be kept as separate from and
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
independent of each other as the nature
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
of a free government will admit now I
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
fully understand that in times of Crisis
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
a bending of the rules must be made to
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
allow for concise and Swift action but
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
the necessity for such timely decisions
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
that could be made by The Stroke of a

pen has long since passed the handling
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 crisis can and should be
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
made through a constitutionally
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate process that includes 425

May terminate state of emergency by
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution adopted by a
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%

governor's power to renew a declaration
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
of state of emergency shall terminate
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
upon the adoption of a concurrent

resolution under this
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
subparagraph the immediate crisis that
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
precipitated this emergency was that the
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
projected hospitalization rate of
 
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
covid-19 would outstrip Resources by the
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of Summer of 2020 our
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals were better equipped it became
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
evident that we would not exceed
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hospital capacity so much that we chose
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
to shut down our surge Flex facilities
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
indeed we have never ex exceeded 75% of
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
the total impatient bed capacity in New
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the percentage of those
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
with covid-19 peaked at
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
11.6% while covid-19 continues to spread
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
the reality is there is no longer a
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
crisis that prevents the legislature
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
from working nor is there a crisis that
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
requires immediate actions on the part
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
of the executive
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
branch while it has been challenging to
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
figure out the financial situation in
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
regards to the federal funding of the
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
state of emergency I have spoken to
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
other states who have had state agencies
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
do this research uh Wisconsin in
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
particular and I have consulted with
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
lawyers about the Stafford act the cares
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
Act and the Consolidated Appropriations
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
act ultimately it seems that because we
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
are in a national state of emergency we
 
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
do not need New Hampshire to be in a
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
state of emergency to receive support
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
from these
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
acts this resolution is not meant to be
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
a criticism of the covid-19 mitigation
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
Strategies employed by the executive
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
branch nor is it a statement that the
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic is over it is a declaration
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
that we are restoring our Republic in a
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
letter to William Hunter Thomas
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
Jefferson wrote the Republican is the
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
only form of government which is not
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
eternally at open or secret war with the
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
rights of mankind in conclusion it is
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
time to restore our constitutional
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
republic by ending the state of
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
emergency to protect the health safety
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%

37 the towns of Hudson and pelum while
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
Co has been a serious health problem and
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
many have died of it many others have
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
died or been otherwise harmed by the
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
response to co while the covid deaths
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
are before us in the news almost daily
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
the harm caused by Co is less obvious
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
but just as real a study by the National
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau of economic research concluded
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic and recession were
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
associated with 10 to 60% increase in
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
deaths of Despair above the already high
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
prepandemic levels that study as well as
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
the CDC also concluded that opioid
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
overdoses were the highest ever recorded
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
in a 12-month period in 2020
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
while unemployment benefits have been
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
increased and extended according to the
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
US Bureau of Labor Statistics over 40%
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
of those who lost their jobs due to the
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
emergency mandates are not expected to
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
regain them by November 2020 more than
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
100 million Americans were not working
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is up over 9 million from the same

2019 unemployment is associated with a
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
60% increase in mortality and this
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
impact is likely to continue long after
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%

if you believe that the threat from Co

Justified the state of
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
emergency which I believe it it did
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
especially initially when we weren't
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
sure how bad it would be we need to end
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
it as soon as possible to reduce the
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
future harm it will cause to start to
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
recover from its impact especially on
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
those least able to deal with it uh

mental health for minorities was already

I'm representative Leah kushman from we
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
I serve on the health human services and
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee and I'm
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
speaking today in support of
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
hcr2 as a registered nurse health is
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
very important to me as an American a
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire and as a
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislator the rights of individuals are
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
also very important to me when
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
considering appropriate government
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
action in mitigating communicable
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
diseases is vital that a balance is
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
maintained so that policies implemented
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
are as least restrictive as possible in
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
relation to the level of threat to the
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
public after examining the toll of
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 on New Hampshire and the
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
measures taken by government to mitigate
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
it it is clear to me that the state of
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
emergency declared by the governor is no
 
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.590 align:start position:0%
emergency declared by the governor is no
longer

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
necessary every death is a tragedy and
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
the information I will be providing in
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
my testimony is no in no way meant to
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
minim the pain that families who have
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
lost loved ones have endured the
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
forthcoming information provides context
 
00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
forthcoming information provides context
and

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
perspective according to New Hampshire
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
do division of Vital Records a total of
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
13532 people died in New Hampshire in
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
2020 and of those deaths 85 or 6% died
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
with covid-19 according to New Hampshire
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
DHHS 12% of the total population of New
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are aged 70 and older about
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
90% of those who have died with Co 19
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
are in this age group just under 80% of
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire deaths in 2020 with
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
covid-19 were in long-term care
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
facilities additionally 60% of New
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population are aged 0 to 49
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's about 780,000 people within this
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
group there are 15 total deaths with
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 reported or
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
0.002% those 15 were all between the
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
ages of 20 and 49 thankfully there are
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
zero reported deaths with covid-19 and
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyone aged 19 and under in New
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you can see from these
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
numbers the relative risk of dying with
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 in New Hampshire for the
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the population
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
is very small let's put this into
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
context in New Hampshire in 2020 3.5
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
times as many people died of heart
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
disease than
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 3.4 times as many people died
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
of cancer than covid the infamous
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
Spanish Flu of 1918 and 1919 resulted in
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
the death of about 3,000 Granite Staters
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
which is more than three times as many
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
deaths with
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 at a time when the population
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was about onethird of
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
today now one of the main reasons to
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
justify the start of and continuation of
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency in the beginning
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 pandemic was the need to
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
slow the spread flatten the curve or in
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
other words avoid overwhelming New
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals and resources
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
fortunately overflow facilities set up
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
last spring were never needed and were
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
soon dismantled in fact New Hampshire
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals never exceeded 75% capacity
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire period from March
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
2020 through now at its highest point in
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
terms of hospitalizations in early
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
January of 2021 only 11.6% of all
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
impatient beds were occupied by Co

impatient beds were occupied by Co
covid-19

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
patients in conclusion the threat to the
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
general population by covid-19 does not
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
warrant the continuation of the state of
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
emergency DHHS has authority over
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
long-term care for facilities and the
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
ability to focus mitigation efforts
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
where they are most needed without
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
emergency orders the legislature is the
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
proper body for lawmaking not the chief
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
executive it is high time for restoring
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional balance of power I
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
urge the members of the committee to
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
give hcr2 an a to pass recommendation I
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for hearing my
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%

morning I will not be taking any
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions but I will submit my testimony
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
via email to the committee members thank
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%

have um a
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
requested expert from Stanford
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
University um Mr
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
University um Mr
vachera

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
vachera
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
he on
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
the I am on the call uh welcome thank
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
you for getting up earli coming and
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
speaking with us oh thanks for having me
 
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.990 align:start position:0%
speaking with us oh thanks for having me
I'm

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
honored the floor is
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
yours okay thank you for uh thank you
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
all for having me talk uh so in these
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
brief REM Mars I hope to provide some
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
reasons behind my strong support of HR
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
hcr2 which if enacted will lift the
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 state emergency order so I have
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
three arguments first
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh the availability of the covid-19
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines including the newly approved
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Johnson vaccine in effect
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
defangs the virus uh all three of the
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
approved vaccines are incredibly
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
effective in preventing hospitalizations
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
and deaths caused by SARS CO2 infection
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
and it's true even after a single dose
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
of even the fiser and madna vaccines um
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has actually done a pretty
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
good job of vaccinating population
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
quickly to date by the statistics I
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
looked up yesterday 16 and a half% of
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
the population have received at least
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
one dose of the vaccine and 7% of
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
receive both doses even more importantly
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is making good progress in
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinating its elderly population and
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home residents um think
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
something like 19% of New Hampshire's
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
population is over the age of 65 and by
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
my rough projection which I conducted
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday I anticipate that nearly all
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
of them will have been offered a vaccine
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
well before the end of March crucially I
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
believe nearly every nursing home
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
resident in New Hampshire has already
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
been offered a vaccine or is is about to
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
be uh nearly I think somewhere somewhere
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
between 70 80% of Co related deaths in
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have have been linked to
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
nursing homes so prioritizing that
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
population vaccine has yielded already
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
and will continue to yield a great
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
return in terms of reduced morbidity and
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
mortality associated with covid
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
infection it's no accident that the
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
covid death rate in New Hampshire has
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
dropped by a factor of 10 from its peak
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
of one death per 100,000 residents on
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
January 8th to 0.1 death per 100,000
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
resence the end of
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
February a 10 times drop the population
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
over 70 faces a much High higher risk of
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
mortality after infection than does the
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
population under 70 according to data
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
published by the World Health
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
Organization the infection survival rate
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
for people under 70 is
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
99.95% while it's only 95% for people
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
over 70 the older population protected
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
by vacine uh once that happens we will
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
never again see the high death count
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
from the virus that we saw last year the
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine transforms this epidemic from an
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely deadly terrible epidemic and
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
something much much much more
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
manageable second the harms from the
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
lockdown are manifold and devastating
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
including worse cardiovascular disease
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes less cancer screening
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
deteriorating mental health to name a
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
few the social isolation induced by the
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
lockdowns and the and the the state of
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
emergency had led to Sharp rise in
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
opioid and drug related overdoses
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
similar to the deaths of dispair that
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
occurred during the the 2008 Great
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
Recession social isolation of the
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
elderly has contributed to a sharp rise
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
in dementia related deaths around the
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
country for children the cessation of
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
inperson schooling and and the
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
replacement of inperson schooling with
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
with on online schooling or or in hybrid
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
schooling with with severe restrictions
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
has led to catastrophic learning losses
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
with with severe adverse consequences
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
for affected students lifespans
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
according to CDC estimate one in four
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
young adults this past June seriously
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
considered suicide one in three adults
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
worldwide are clinically depressed or
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
anxious as a with clinical anxiety
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
during the lockdown um the state of
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
emergency has had absolutely devastating
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
effects even on populations where covid
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
poses a relatively small LK I said the
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
99.95% survival for people under 70 the
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
harms of the lockdown are unequally
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
distributed economists have found that
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
only 37% of jobs in the US can be
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
performed wholly online and high paying
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
jobs are over represented among that set
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
you I think of now of the of the
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
lockdowns as a as trickle down
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
epidemiology they've served to protect
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
the relatively well off while exposing
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
the relatively poor to the infection um
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
third and finally once the vulnerable
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
population is protected the vaccine the
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
imposition of lockdown on net on net
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
harms the population some of argue for a
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
lock time policy aims at reducing Co
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
spread to zero this is a foolish and
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
shortsighted policy goal that will
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
continue to the devastating harms we've
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
seen from the lockdown while yielding
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
little in terms of population health
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
benefit the SARS CO2 virus has none of
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
the epidemological properties of a
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
disease that can be eradicated it's too
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
widespread in the population worldwide
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
it's not good enough for disease to be
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
eradicated in New Hampshire but we need
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
to eradicate it worldwide or else
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
disease would constantly be reintroduced
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the population and we a cycle of
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
lockdowns like we've seen in New Zealand
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
for so far today week weeks long um with
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
deep uncertainty in economic outcomes uh
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
there are animal reservoirs for virus
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
including dogs cats bats mink and other
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
mammals eradicating human transmission
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
would not be enough to get rid of the
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
disease are we prepared to sacrifice our
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
pets also eradication will require
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
Universal vaccination but the vaccine
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
has not been tested in some population
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
who can transmit the disease including
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
children and pregnant women it's
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
unethical to mandate vaccination
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
populations of the vaccine has not been
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
tested the only human disease that's
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
ever been eradicated worldwide is
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
smallpox and that effort took decades
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
even with the availability of a good
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine SARS kotu eradication is
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
impossible and should not be attempted
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
the best policy is to protect the
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable with the vaccine that is
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
folks in nursing homes elderly people
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and others with chronic diseases that
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
that predispose and the poor outcomes
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
and end the lockdown to stop the damages
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
doing the population at large this can
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
be accomplished within with with at the
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
current rate of vaccination within a
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
month the bill under consideration by
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature would
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
accomplish this purpose and I stand
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor of it thank you I'm
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions if I have time
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
or else if I don't I I've also submitted
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
my testimony on um in written form thank
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
um are there any
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
questions within committee room um
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them on Zoom I have one question
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
um and I was neglectful in the beginning
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh you've been build by the prime
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor as an expert uh do you have uh
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
in in in what area is your specialty uh
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
sure so I am I uh I am a professor of
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
medicine at Stanford University I have
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
published um over the last two decades
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh in peerreview journals on infectious
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
disease epidemiology and infectious
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
disease policy uh I'm a I have a MD and
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
a PhD in uh in economics my um uh area
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
is Health economics extensively about
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
the uh Health economics and in
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
particular about epidemiology and health
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
economics including a textbook I've
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
written on on the subject I've written
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
on HIV policy H1N1 policy uh on uh uh H
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh on a whole series of of of of
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
articles in the pre-co era um on
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
infectious disease I've also during the
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
during uh covid I've written on um I was
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
I wrote the first Sero prevalence study
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
in Los Angeles County peer peer reviewed
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
measuring the extent of the spread of H
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
of of the SARS Co 2 virus in the early
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
Po in the early days of the epidemic as
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
well I've written on evaluating the the
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
consequences and the efficacy of the
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
lockdown again in peer rreview journals
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
so I've been I've doing a lot of work on
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
hi on on um sarov 2 and on on covid and
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
in particular on on on this policy I'm
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
also the co-author of the great
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
barington declaration which is a uh a uh
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
basically it's an argument for focused
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
protection of the of the uh of the of
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
the the people most vulnerable um to the
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
SARS 2
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
infection thank you um one last question
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh did I understand you just say that
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
you were uh supportive of mandatory
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinations no no I'm against mandatory
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
vaccination I think it's unethical to
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
mandate the vacc vaccine in in
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
populations for whom it has not been
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
tested so for instance there are no
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed testing of the vaccine in
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
children you could not you should not be
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
vanting in children and for instance all
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
same thing with pregnant women it's not
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
there's no uh peer-reviewed evaluation
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine in in in you know
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
randomized valuations in pregnant women
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's it would be right
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
to mandate the vaccine that those
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
populations I'm also against mandating
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine more broadly I think the vaccine
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
is an incredibly important tool it's and
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
and has been shown to be effective in
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
some populations and I think Public
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
Health should strongly recommend in
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
favor of the vaccine but I think a
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
mandating the vaccine would harm Public
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
Health in in in ways I didn't discuss in
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
my in my comments but I'm happy to
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate on if you'd like
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh any further
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again
 
00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:39.870 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again
thank

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
you on the list here oh okay um the
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
chair would like to call David Martin
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
hdr2 Mr

uh Mr chair in in recognition of the uh
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
previous comment I will dispense with
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
the credentials
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
first um I I am the founder of the first
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
medical device contract resear research
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
organization at the University of
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
Virginia um IDM Med my background has
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
been in over three decades of conducting
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
clinical trials my faculty positions
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
were in the department of radiology and
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgery in the medical school
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that I have since
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
1999 been an asset to the United States
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
and foreign governments on studying the
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
proliferation and counter proliferation
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
of biological and chemical weapons
 
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.029 align:start position:0%
of biological and chemical weapons
violations

00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
worldwide um something that we have been
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
quite concerned
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
with I am not going to be commenting
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
specifically on any of the interventions
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
per se but I am in strong support of HRC
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
2 and to put it in context my concern
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
comes out of a briefing that we did
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
several years ago when Dr Peter dashik
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
in February of
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
2016 made the following statement
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
published add a National Academy of
 
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.269 align:start position:0%
published add a National Academy of
Sciences

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
Sciences
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
Forum where he said we need to increase
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
public understanding of the need for Med
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
medical counter measures such as a pan
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
Corona virus vaccine a key driver is the
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
media and the economics will follow the
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
hype we need to use that hype to our
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
advantage to get to the real issues
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
investors will respond if they see
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
profit at the end of the
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
process we wrote a briefing at that time
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there was a significant
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
problem with niid n I Aid
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
selecting not only the Corona virus
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
itself but specifically the Wuhan
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
Institute of Urology virus one which has
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
a very close analog to what is currently
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
considered SARS
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
cov2 we're very concerned when we
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
realized that a study
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
conducted by researchers in the European
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
Journal of
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
epidemiology found that as many as 355
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
350 53
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
individuals between September and
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
November of 2019 in advance of any
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
disease in
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
Wuhan tested positive for what was
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
called the SARS cov2 IGG
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
equivalent suggesting that the SARS cov2
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
fragment of what is considered to be one
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the variants of SARS Corona virus was
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
circulating in the population at least
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
by by September of
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
2019 three months in advance at least of
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
China's first
 
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
report we were further troubled by the
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
fact that when the 100 individuals with
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 between October and December of
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
2019 had their blood assay 67 of the
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
blood tests that were available out of
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
the 100 individuals of covid-19 were
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
tested for antibodies for SAR cov2 and
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
there were none found in other words
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
symptoms and SAR cov2 the virus in fact
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
have at best a modeled but not proven
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
Association and that's been the case in
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
France that's been the case in
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
Europe um across Europe that's been the
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
case in China and it indeed is the case
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
here on March 13th 2020 acting on
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
unconfirmed misleading and foreign
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
supplied intelligence Governor Chris
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
tsunu recited false claims to justify
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of the state of
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
emergency with the best of
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
intentions in the preamble to the
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
Declaration he recited the causal
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
statement linking quote a novel Corona
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
virus to a disease with no evidence then
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
or now substantiating that
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
claim at the time several dozen known
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
variants so SAR covt C coov were
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
published and no clinical evidence
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
showed a quote virus end quote be
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
uniquely causing a disease in fact
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
according to research published in the
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
anals of internal medicine as many as
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
45% of individuals testing positive

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
fragments never manifest covid-19
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
symptoms whatsoever while there may be
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
an association
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
as yet unproven linking the virus to the
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
list of symptoms now aggregated under
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
covid-19 designation at the time of the
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
Declaration both the statement of
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
novelty and causality were conjecture
 
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.349 align:start position:0%
novelty and causality were conjecture
not

00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
fact furthermore he stated that the
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
quote State of New Hampshire has been
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
working in close collaboration with the
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
CDC quote since December 2019 to Monitor
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
and plan for the potential spread of
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 to the United states end quote
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
this claim test credibility as covid-19
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
was not identified nor named until
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
February 2020 and the CDC has no record
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the public of any such collaboration
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
so no such action has been
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
documented relying on computer
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
simulations from the United Kingdom he
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
recited unproven allegations about the
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
spread of
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
co9 an erroneous statement as viruses
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
not symptoms can
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
spread and he recited the fact that they
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
spread by respiratory droplets another
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
statement that has not yet been
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
established with any clinical evidence
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
and that is a very important Point while
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
there have been Environmental Studies
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
modeling the spread of how the virus may
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
move across time and space with the
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
exception of a modeled study in a
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
hospital setting where data collection
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
was done at varying proximities to a
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
patient while they did show that a virus
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
in fact did move across time and space
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
in that particular setting no study of
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
transmissivity with infectivity has ever
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
been established with SARS cov2 and that
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
remains the case today in short relying
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
on hearsay rather than on Independent
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry Governor cunu enacted a state of
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
emergency in coordination with others
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
without considering ing the ample
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
evidence to indicate that factors other
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
than public health emergency were at
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
play preservation of the state of
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
emergency serves commercial interests
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
federally under the prep act for limited
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
liability for medical countermeasures
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
but serves no Public Health interest and
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
I have submitted an extensive written
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee um by email
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
yesterday thank you are you willing to
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
take questions I am
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
indeed are there any questions in the
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
Zoom being none thank you very much for
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
welcome we've concluded the 30 minutes
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
set aside
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
for um the sponsors of the plan um of
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
the bill we will now move on
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
to members of the public um you have any
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair will recognize Robert clay uh
 
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.109 align:start position:0%
chair will recognize Robert clay uh
Senator

00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
and all around good guy
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
um Mr thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I just wanted
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
to come on today I'm in favor of house
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh concurrent resolution 2 I wanted to
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
come on and give people a little history
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
of of how we got to where we are back
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
after 9911 um the governor at the time
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
was caught in Washington DC leaving the
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in a unique
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
position of having the Senate President
 
00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.109 align:start position:0%
position of having the Senate President
being

00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
charged what we found out at that time
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
is that only the governor had access to
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management and a whole lot of
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
other um systems that we needed to to to
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
share at the time we worked out a way of
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
getting things done because the
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
government governor was stranded I think
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
for at least a week uh since all the
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
roads were were shut down what we found
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
during uh the 9911 time is that we were
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
being uh threatened with Anthrax attacks
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um we also did some mock drills to see
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we were attacked
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
with chemical warfare and we found that
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
we were um extremely
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
unprepared um for any kind of attack and
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
and any kind of um work that might need
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
to be done so I'm giving you the short
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
version what we did is after we got
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
things rolling and and we started uh
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
gaining some momentum we worked not uh
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
as a partisan group but as a bipartisan
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
group we worked with the governor and we
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
came up with what you see in in
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
445 but the intent was that should we be
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
struck again and the legislature not be
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
able to meet somebody had to take
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
charge before before 911 the governor
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
could just declare an mergency and stay
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
forever so what we said is that we
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't allow the governor to stay in
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
charge for more than 21 days we never
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
fathom that something would happen where
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature could never come
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
together and meet and take control of
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
what needed to be done in the state of
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we we said 21 days but
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
if we were attacked more than once or on
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
a continuous basis we still needed a way
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to lead the state which is
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
why we put put the provision in that
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
said he could renew it but again it was
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
never renew it with the ability of the
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to meet it was to renew so
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
that without a
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislature we continued to do what was
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
necessary for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
what I've seen today uh or or under the
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
Corona virus um emergency act um is is
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
totally opposite of anything we ever
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
fathomed as a group of people a
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group we always figured that
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
a governor would never want to be in
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
total control and the legislature would
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to meet and actually do what was
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
ever necessary so I'm in favor of house
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution 2 we we put that
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
in by the way so that no matter what and
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
no matter who the legislature could come
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
in at any time during that 21 days and
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
say okay enough we're back the Republic
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
the Republic is going to work and we'll
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
take it from here it was never to stop
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
the constant renewal of an emergency
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
order so while I think that we had all
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
the right intentions at the time um as
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
Justice delus used to say if that's what
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
you meant make sure that's what it says
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hopeful that you'll pass house
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution to and that you'll
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
tweak the law as it is to say that the
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
governor can't just unilaterally decide
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
to renew an order that that gives him
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
total control and only allows him to do
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
so in a situation where the
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
legislature can't possibly meet together
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
in a quorum to actually take control and
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
do what's necessary thank you Mr
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I'll
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you have any thank
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
you uh are there questions in the
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
committee room questions on seeing n
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:22.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
thank

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
you uh just so the committee is aware uh
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
there's an additional 10 people that
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
have signed up to speak ranging from 5
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
minutes to zero minutes for some reason
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
um but and we also have one person who
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
has raised their hand that I saw
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
initially um so if the speakers could
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
keep their time um and their comments to
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
items that we have not heard before that
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
would be great um and to be as uh as
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
efficient as possible that would also be
 
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.109 align:start position:0%
efficient as possible that would also be
appreciated

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
axan can you hear me okay now yes we can

very much Mr chairman thank you to the
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Elliot I live in
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
hookset New Hampshire I am a husband a
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
brother a son and an uncle I'm also a
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
paramedic I've dedicated my life to
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
helping others mostly by providing
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
Medical Care to those in need I spent
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
around three years as a young
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
EMT volunteering an average of 30 hours
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
a week to provide medical care to my
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
community only resigning because
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
paramedic school demanded my
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
time I'm a critical care and flight
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
certified paramedic which is technically
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
the highest level of certification that
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
any prehospital provider could attain in
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
the United States I spent spent 10 years
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
in Emergency Medical Services working on
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
an ambulance in multiple M11 agencies
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
and multiple Critical Care transport
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
agencies managing acutely and
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
chronically ill patients on ventilators
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
IV pumps and all sorts of other
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
equipment I've treated over 10,000
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
patients throughout my career my
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
experience also includes working in a
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
coronavirus Hospital in May during the
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic as a member of as a paramedic
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
and a member of their critical rapid
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
response team all of my experience and
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
research leads me to believe that Co is
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
not nearly as contagious as the elites
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
have made it seem all of my experience
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
and research leads me to believe that Co
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
is not nearly as deadly as the elites
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
and politicians have made it
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
seem however even if it were the most
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
contagious and deadly virus in history
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
of humanity the restrictions imposed by
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the governor and his Regulators rival
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
the most tyrannical regimes that I know
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
of in history for some of these
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions to be in effect in the
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
supposedly free estate is nothing short
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
of a disgrace for for this state of
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
emergency to have gone on for a year and
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
that it remains in effect indefinitely
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
with no signs of ever being terminated
 
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.750 align:start position:0%
with no signs of ever being terminated
is

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
unconscionable I believe that the only
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
justification for a governor declaring a
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and acting without
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
input from the legislature is in the
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
presence of a real imminent threat such
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
as missiles literally being in the air
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
fired by a foreign
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
military Common Sense R dictate that the
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
governor could without consulting the
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislature order a defensive maneuver
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
to intercept those missiles because 30
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
seconds could make a big difference and
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
assembling A legislature for a meeting
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
and passing legislation would actually
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a very negative effect and could
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
not defend our
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
state but that's not what happened in
 
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.390 align:start position:0%
state but that's not what happened in
this

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
case in this case it was a virus that
 
00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559 align:start position:0%
initially was thought to maybe be an
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
emergency and I believe the plan
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
initially was for uh 15 days to slow the
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
spread we were all convinced by our
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
governor that if we all clamp down very
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
hard for 15 days we could get back to
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
normal afterwards and that if we did not
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
we would all die and now a year later we
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
are all still alive but we are living
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
under a dictator who has rendered this
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
legislature irrelevant and taken over
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
complete power of the state and it shows
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
no signs of ending if there is one thing
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
that I know it's what an emergency looks
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
like this was never an emergency
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not in New Hampshire and it
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
certainly is not an emergency today
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
using the force of government and police
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
to quarantine even a person confirmed to
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
be contagious with the most deadly virus
 
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.950 align:start position:0%
be contagious with the most deadly virus
like

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
Ebola is difficult violates Liberty and
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
technically is legally and morally
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
questionable at best and it should be
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
used with the utmost caution but
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
politicians have gone far beyond that in
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
this case locking down and restricting
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
the movements and the Commerce and even
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
the breathing of individuals who are not
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
confirmed to have the virus this
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
violates due process even people who
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
test negative for the virus one moment
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
cannot legally breathe in New Hampshire
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
without a mask one second after a
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
negative test result not only is every
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
person presumed to be sick with the
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
virus it is impossible for a supposedly
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
free person to prove to politicians and
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
police that we are not sick even if we
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
test negative we still have to wear the
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
mask even if we had the virus a year ago
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
even if we got both
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines the very basis of a proper
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
justice system in this modern world is
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
the presumption of innocent until proven
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
guilty in the current scenario we are
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
all presumed to be guilty in this case
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
means infected and contagious with the
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
virus and it is impossible to prove that
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
one is innocent or in this case not sick
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
this might be comparable to a justice
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
system in a place like North Korea not
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
only have our most natural rights been
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
violated but this was done not by a
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
legislative body which somewhat
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
represent the people but by executive
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
order of one politician assuming the
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
power of a dictator technically speaking
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
issuing more than 80 emergency orders
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
over the past year and this body has
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
remained silent throughout Mr Mr can we
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
wrap this up yes sir I have one more
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph be 30 seconds making this
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
lockdown even more ridiculous is that
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
the official statistics are inflated by
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
100 to 1,000 fold in my expert opinion I
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
have a few thousand sources and an
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
article to this effect has been
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
submitted to the record already you now
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
have the authority to pass this
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
resolution hcr2 and end the state of
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
emergency while taking powers back to
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
the for the legislative body though this
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
will not make up for the children who
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
missed a year of their childhoods
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
because they were brainwash into
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
thinking they will die if they play with
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
their friends or even lower their mask
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
for an instant you could never give back
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
the months of time the governor took
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
from people who wanted nothing more than
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
to spend time with their parents
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents and other loved ones many
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
of which no longer have that opportunity
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
nor will this compensate every business
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
that has been permanently put out of
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
business by the governor many people are
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
referring to this current state of
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
emergency as child abuse or elder abuse
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it's getting harder to argue with
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
them and I'm starting to see their Merit
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
for the sake of everything cherished by
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%

00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair thank you committee members
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
former representative Jeff olgy I'll be
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
very brief there are a thousand reasons
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
why I hope you support hcr2 I won't
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
review them with you today one of one of
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
your speakers uh by the name of David I
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
believe uh had some very uh good
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
information it was rather technical I
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
would ask if he could give us a one one
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
or two sentence blurb on his summary if
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
he's still available that would be
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
terrific I am an engineer by trade um
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
and I found his his uh dissertation very
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
informative but rather Technical and a
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
little bit overwhelming on on
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
information the bottom line is and the
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
reason I support this is as as Ronald
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
Reagan said I'm from the government I'm
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
here to help and gez that doesn't always
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
work so well our governor in in in his
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
defense he assembled a large diverse
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
team to guide him on this issue uh
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
almost a year ago now and what have we
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
gotten I I'll summarize by saying what I
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
think we got was a mistake this is a
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
mistake this lockdown these these uh
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
state of emergency has been a mistake
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
for many months now as you've heard
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
previous testimony uh this should have
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
been cancelled long ago um I'm a student
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
of Statistics myself and despite all of
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
the experts advising the governor there
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
is no statistical basis uh to conclude
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
that this the state of emergency should
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
have progressed the way it has simply
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
none um so I will end it there I I urge
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
you please support uh ending this uh
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
this problem and I think this is a case
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
study that shows that if we assemble a
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
large group of politicians we all don't
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily get the right answer our
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
governor decided to decided to take the
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
route which was comfortable and
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
favorable to many people under the guise
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
of empathy and protecting you uh as
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to promoting personal
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and asking you to protect
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
yourself if you are an atrisk person
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's it for my comments thanks
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
for hearing me I I will uh I will take

hcr2 my name is stepen axelman and for

rabbi of a synagogue in New York City I

though I do not currently practice as a

psychotherapist over the last year my
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
synagogue has gone through several
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
months of not holding any in-person
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
services including over last year's
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
Passover holiday the most celebrated
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
event of the Jewish year the Passover
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
seder was closed off to almost everyone
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
during the high holidays last September
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the second most observed events of the
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
Jewish year only a limited number of
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
persons were able to attend services in
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
person last July we reopened our
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
synagogue on a volun AR basis with
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
attendees wearing masks and being
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
socially distanced during services with
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
Refreshments available afterwards for
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
those who wanted to stay our attendees
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
range in age from 25 to the upper 80s I
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
am proud to say that not one of our
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
attendees since July has contracted
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
covid my main message is the incredible
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
painful loneliness that people
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
especially the elderly have gone through
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
over the last 11 months many of them
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
basically locked in their own homes
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
without being able to see their friends
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
children grandchildren and
 
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.349 align:start position:0%
children grandchildren and
great-grandchildren

00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
great-grandchildren
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
the saddest part of this situation is
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
known to me through my officiating at
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
funerals I do not deny that many people
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
have and are dying of covid but hearing
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
so many stories of loved ones taking
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
their elderly relatives to hospitals
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
dropping them off outside an emergency
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
room and not being able to be with them
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
in person at any time until they pass is
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
indescribably painful for both sides I
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
do not know how anyone from a
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
psychological or spiritual perspective
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
could make the argument that there is
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
not a severe negative effect on people
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
from being socially isolated banned from
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
touch and even being in the same same
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
room of a Dying loved
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
one all of life is a balance of risks
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
and benefits that should always remain
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the discretion of the individuals and
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
families who are the only ones who can
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
realistically assess their situations
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
and do what is best for each person New
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Live Free or Die State
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
should never be allowed to become as
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
unfree as the state in which I live and
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
it is within yourth authority to make
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
sure that never happens thank you I'd be
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%

wonderful thank you um next the
chair

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
Maslin good morning can you hear me yes
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
we can welcome thank
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
you good morning my name is Ed Mish I
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
was invited to give testimony and
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
support of the resolution by Melissa
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
blasek one of the supporters of the of
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
the resolution I have been a practicing
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
attorney for 25 years and I have
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
litigated constitutional law cases
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
although admittedly I have never
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
litigated constitutional analogous to
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
the issue before the committee today
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's because the issue before the
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee today is unprecedented in
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
American history with the possible
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
exception of the Japanese internment
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
camps before I focus on the individual
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
trees of the forest that make the
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
current emergency order unconstitutional
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think it makes sense to begin by
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
focusing on the forest itself
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
Constitutions are written not for the
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of giving government broad
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
Powers rather Constitutions are written
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of limiting government
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
power in order to promote human
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
flourishing and individual liberty
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
indeed article one and two of the New
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bill of Rights specifically
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
provide that all individuals are born
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
free and independent and have the
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
inherent right to seek and obtain
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
happiness in accordance with their own
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
judgment the emergency order and the
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
reasons offered in support of it
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
contradict those foundational principles
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
of constitutional government one of the
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
foundational principles of a free
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
Society is the presumption of innocence
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
again that presumption of innocence is
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
implied In Articles 1 and two of the New
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bill of Rights people born
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
free and independent with the inherent
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
right to seek and obtain happiness are
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily in until proven guilty
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
indeed if one studies the history of the
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
American Revolution it was fought as
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
much over the opposition to taxation
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
without representation as it was over
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
the Crown's use of General warrants
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
known as rits of assistance articles
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
article 2B of the New Hampshire
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution codifies the protection by
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
providing that an individual's right to
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
live free from government intrusion in
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
private and personal affairs is natural
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
inessential and inherent but the
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
emergency order does not treat all
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
individuals as free and independent it
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
does not start with a presumption that
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
individuals have a right to privacy what
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
they right to seek and obtain happiness
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
according to their judgment nor does it
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
start with a presumption of innocence
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
instead the broad emergency powers
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
exercised by the executive under this
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
emergency order presumes all individuals
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
either have covid or are spreaders of
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
covid for the first time in American
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
history we are quarantining not just
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
people who have been specifically
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
identified as having a contagious and
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
communicable disease instead the
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
emergency order serves as a general
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
warrant limiting the freedom of all
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire including
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
those for whom there is no evidence of
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
Co infection further even those who
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
prove that they do not have covid are
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
treated as though they have covid this
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
is completely different from the
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
quarantines that took place at Ellis
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
Island with regard to immigrants who
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
were inspected and found to have a
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
communicable disease is also completely
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
different from De side a more modern
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
example the quarantine of individuals
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
who contracted the Ebola virus
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
quarantining the sick is different in
 
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind from quarantining everyone
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
including those For Whom the government
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
has no specific evidence of infection I
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
challenge any supporter of the emergency
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
order to articulate any private conduct
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
that is immune from restriction by the
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
governor should the governor simply
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
assert a connection between the conduct
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
and stopping the spread of covid does
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
the governor have the power to order
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
under the order to send the National
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
Guard to people's homes to inspect and
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
confirm that all individuals in the
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
dwelling do not have covid and are
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
practicing social distancing does the
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
governor have the power to send the
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
National Guard to private dwellings and
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
compel individuals to be vaccinated more
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
generally can the supporters of the
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency Powers articulate
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
any limiting principle to the executives
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
power under this emergency order I do
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
not see any such limiting principle
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
turning quickly to the trees here is a
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
brief list of the Constitutional
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions I believe the emergency order
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
violates from the New Hampshire Bill of
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
Rights Article one's guarantee that all
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
men are born free and independent
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
article two is guarantee that all
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
individuals have the right to acquire
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
property and seek and obtain happiness
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
according to their own judgment article
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
2B is a guarantee of the individual's
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
right to privacy article 5's guarantee
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
that no man shall be restrained in the
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
exercise of his religious worship
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
article 15's guarantee of among other
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
things the presumption of innocence
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
article 19's prohibition on the use of
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
General warrants by the executive
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
article 29's requirement that any
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
suspension of law be exercised by the by
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature not any other branch of
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
the government in article 37's guarantee
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
of a separation of powers between the
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
legislative executive and judicial
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
branches the emergency powers exercised
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
by the Executive also violate the
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
provisions of the New Hampshire
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution set forth in part two
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
relating to form of government
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
specifically the emergency Powers
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
violate Article 2 which vests all
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
legislative power in the House of
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
Representatives and Senate not the not
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
the executive Article 5 which likewise
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes only the legislator
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
possessing the power to exercise
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislative powers article 41 which
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
grants the executive only the power to
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
Faithfully execute the laws not to make
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
laws and the latter half of article 83
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
which guarantees free and Fair
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
competition in trades and industries for
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
all people I note further that the
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
provisions of article 51 strongly
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
suggest that the emergency Powers
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
currently being exercised exceed the
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
Constitutional grant of authority to the
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
executive article 51 states that even in
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
times of insurrection and Invasion the
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
governor as commander-in-chief still
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
must exercise emergency Powers
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with all rules regulations
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the constitution of the state thus
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
even in so far as a statute delegating
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
emergency power from the legislature to
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the governor purports to Grant the
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
governor power to violate separation of
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
powers and support and suspend
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional guarantees such
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
delegation itself violates article 51
 
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
not to mention articles 2 and five of
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
part two of the State Constitution
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
furthermore there is little doubt that
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
as bad as Co May
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
is certainly not a greater emergency
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
than Insurrection or Invasion the
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
emergency powers exercised by the
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
executive here also violate Pro
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Federal Constitution
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
including article 4 section 4's
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee of a republican form of
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
government as well as analogous Federal
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
guarantees as set forth above in the New
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution but because my
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
time is limited I won't get into those
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
thank you if you have questions I'm here
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%

citizen I submitted a written testimony
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
to you by email uh last night um I'm in
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
favor of passing hcr2 and ending the
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
state of emergency immediately For
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
Better or Worse the people's Authority
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
that you represent has been usurped by
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and this state of
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
lawlessness has persisted well beyond
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
any reasonable time period as such many
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and organizations who have
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
been harmed the most by the owner of
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and authoritarian restrictions
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
have been fined and threatened with
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
fines assuming a degree of normaly as
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
they attempt to survive I want to focus
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
on the word survive it's a term that has
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
not been used in well over a hundred
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
years in the state of New Hampshire it's
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
imperative that we restore our
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic and the old
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
normal immediately to ensure that these
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
businesses can operate with a fair and
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
balanced rule of law as they were
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
accustomed to before which protects the
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
minority from the majority what this
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
Governor has instituted is a state of
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
lawlessness there is no no law being
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
followed whether you or not you agree
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the content of the copious
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
emergency orders passed by the chief
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
executive since March or the persistent
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that has well
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
surpassed an expectation of the writer
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
of RSA 445 which you heard earlier Bob
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
CLE uh the fact of the matter is that
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
your legislative body ought to be
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
writing State policy the courts ought to
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
be adjudicating disputes and the
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
governor ought to be enforcing law
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
rather than assuming all three of the
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
duties for himself one might argue that
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
the ideas in some of the governor's
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
emergency orders might not pass if left
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature but that is precisely
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
the point of having a separation of
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
powers in our government no one man or
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
woman should be writing policy for more
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
than a million people with without any
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
checks on his power the Constitutional
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
process ensures that policies are for
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
the public good and others that do not
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
measure up to the body's consensus ought
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
not to be law this isn't about one
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
Governor but about any Governor at any
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
time we have a legislature and a
 
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional process for proposing and
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
adopting State policy after has been
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
fully vetted by the public to make sure
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's constitutional and useful for
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
building up the people's Liberty and
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
securing their rights it's now time for
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
you to ensure this power is restored by
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
ending the state of
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
emergency uh many people have commented
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
about the governor's popularity is a
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
rationale for not ending the state of
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
emergency um but I would remind you that
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
we don't live in a democracy where the
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
majority rules or the most praised idea
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
wins the day even the best ideas ought
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be vetted and held up to a standard
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
of law written into the Constitution to
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the minority's rights are
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
protected if 99 people for example out
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
of a 100 think that the one person's
 
01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
land that he purchased and developed
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
under the law is better suited to
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
another private purpose it doesn't
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
matter we have a constitutional
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
provision that prohibits the majority
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
from taking the land because that one
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
person has rights that matter the point
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the example is that we have laws in
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
this state that you may have even helped
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
write and these laws are being
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
disregarded by our governor right now
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be as the Constitution
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
makes clear only the legislature or the
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
people have the authority to suspend or
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
create laws the governor and other
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
executive branch officials do not have
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
that Authority uh even in a state of
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
emergency under RSA 445 and related
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
statutes the governor May suspend rules
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
or regulations passed by the executive
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
branch of government
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
but by no means me may he suspend law or
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the Constitution or write new law
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
himself however he's doing just that
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
under the color of law with his
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
emergency orders and it has to end now
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
there is no higher priority than making
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh hcr2 uh into a adopted resolution as
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
of today if if it's at all possible I
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
have nothing to gain by making these
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
statements or this request of you and
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
everything to lose I simply want to get
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
back to the way of life I know to be
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
best suited for for providing the most
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
people with the best chance of a
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
fulfilling life I want that for my
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
children my wife my church my clients
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
and the people of this state I want to
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that no Governor could ever do
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
again what this Governor has done for
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
there is no emergency that warrants the
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
total control of one man the idea is
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
anathema to this country I ask you to
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
stand together Republicans and Democrats
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
in boldness and end this onean rule in
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire restore our constitutional
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
republic without fear and know and know
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
that well Messi a free Society does more
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
good for more people than any other
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
system that has ever been tried please
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
patch HCR to so we can get back to it
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and um I I don't think I'll take
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for your
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
again CH
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
Tucker just so the committee knows we
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
now have uh five people additionally
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
raising hands and we

for letting me speak as a New Hampshire
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
citizen I cannot believe that we the
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
people have been living under the orders
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
of one person for 11 months without any
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
representation or input this is not how
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
a representative democracy
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
works this is how a dictatorship works
 
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
you we have elected you the legislator
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
to be our the people's Representatives
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
so I certainly hope you will support
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
hcr2 especially giving the medical facts
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
that have come out over the last 11
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
months these orders have shown
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
themselves to be arbitrary and have had
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
a great impact on us We the People our
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
ability to earn a living have input in
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
the Democratic process gain access to
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%

normal I haven't seen my father in
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
months he's 91 because he's locked up
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that these rules do
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
anything to stop the spread of covid-19
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerous precedent that is
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
being set and one that should not be
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
allowed in any free Society again we
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%

welcome well thank you thank you for the
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity I want to bring up something
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit different I agree with
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
everybody about constitutional rights
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff but I just want to
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
bring something up about this emergency
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think we ever had an emergency
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
and if you do some research on the germ
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
theory of disease versus the terrain
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
theory of disease uh the terrain theory
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
is what everything is based on and it's
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
unproven and this whole thing is based
 
01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
on PCR tests which again the inventor of
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
the PCR test Nobel Prize winner Carrie
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mullis said you can't use it to diagnose
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
any disease yet we're diagnosing this
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 non-existing virus with this
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
thing in healthy people they've never
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
isolated this virus they've never proved
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
it exists or causes sickness that's the
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
science at least my opinion so where are
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
we at now we can't even breathe in New
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under these crazy Emperor
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
edicts businesses are being destroyed
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
spending is reckless federal and
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
state uh the real virus is governments
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
federal state and local it's also the
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
medical industrial complex which is
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
greatly profiting off this whole
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
scamdemic and continues to push this
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
thing and of course they want to push
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccines on us so they can make $50
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
billion a year so in conclusion I would
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
ask what some other people have asked
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the Live Free or Die
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
State let's let the people live freely
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
forget these emergency nonsense orders
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
from the emperor and let's not live in
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
fear of dying from this covid sniffle
 
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.270 align:start position:0%
fear of dying from this covid sniffle

enabled by this state of emergency last
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
year the school district approved a
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
district budget without a public Hearing
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
in violation of state law we have the

second largest District in the state and
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
the budget's over 100 $150 million a
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
year the school board refused to meet in
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
person and did not allow public comment
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
for 10 months no public comment during

all of its virtual meetings virtual
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
meetings are it just means we have no
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
self-government and it violates the
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
right to to no law I was personally
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
slapped with a restraining order for
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
taking a picture of a board member at a
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
local post office to prove that she left
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
her house even though she claims she's
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
unable to do so and meet other than in
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
Virtual meetings the government state of
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
emergency allowed the court to deny me
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
the right to face my accuser in public
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%

welcome that'd be great um chair

coners I hope I pronounced that right
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
Conor so sorry about that I was having
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
some connectivity issues I apologize um
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
no worries welcome to legislative
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you for the
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the committee
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
today my name is James Conor a resident
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
of Amherst and I'm testifying as a
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
member of the public in support of hcr2
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
I prepared a written testimony by email
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh but I'd like to just
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
highlight a few brief points at this
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
time about some of the data available
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
regarding overall mortality in 2020 um
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
so to put to sidestep debates we hear
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
about case counts and testing methods
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
one objective method to gauge the
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
severity of widespread disease is the
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
total number of people who have died in
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
a given state in a given year uh so
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
using data available from New Hampshire
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
Department of States division of Vital
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
Records and applying a typ typical age
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment methodology to account for
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
demographic and population changes
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
year-over-year the 2020 ended up being
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
the ninth highest year of overall deaths
 
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years lower than most of
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
the first decade of the 21st century um
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
when you break down the data into age
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
specific rates uh all age brackets
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
showed no discernable change from uh the
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
last several years except for the age 85
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
Plus bracket which has the highest
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
observe rate since 2002 and this makes
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
sense as New Hampshire DHHS reports that
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of all reported deaths with
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 in New Hampshire are from those
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
over 80 years old all other age brackets
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
which is to say those under 74 years old
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
saw no discernable change from recent
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
years so what that means according to
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's own published numbers is
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the overall rate of death for those
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
under age 85 was essentially unchanged
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and on a More granar Level if
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
you compare the all cause age adjusted
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
death rate by month in 2020 to the
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
maximum minimum range going back about
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
15 years it reveals another interesting
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
Trend we did DC a spike in May of 2020
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
it had an abnormally High rate of death
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
above the maximum oberved range in
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
recent past but the rest of the year
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
range from average to a little above
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
average but all within the range of
 
01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:36.990 align:start position:0%
average but all within the range of
recent

01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
experience so all this um all this is uh
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know while there' be more statistics
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and data sets to examine over time it's
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
clear from looking at the data available
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
11 months into the state of emergency
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
that for all but the extremely elderly
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
and those with significant underlying
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
conditions Co is not a uniquely fatal
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
Disease by the data that that that's
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
available and it reinforces the plain
 
01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:02.639 align:start position:0%
fact that children are at in incredibly
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
low risk with not a single recorded
 
01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
covid death of anyone under the age of
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
20 in New Hampshire so this is all not
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
in this focus on mortality is not
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
intended to downplay the seriousness of
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
a respiratory disease that has claimed
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
the lives of hundreds of grand Staters
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
over the last year but we do need to
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate situations like this and our
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
response to them through the lens of
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
History common sense and available data
 
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
the overall mortality for 2020 combined
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
with weekly published data from the
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
national HHS shows that the hospitals in
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have not been at risk
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
being overwhelmed and this demonstrates
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
the entire basis for governor andun
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
continuing this state of emergency is
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
wrong we have real world data that shows
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
how risky and deadly this disease is to
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
the general population so we have no
 
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
excuse to continue to act as if this is
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
still march of 2020 when we didn't have
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
a good idea of what was going going on
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislature must reclaim their governing
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
authority to put an end to the
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
government by executive order that has
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
gone on for far too long I urge this
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
committee to support hcr2 and end the
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
state of emergency thank you for your
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
attention thank you for your testimony
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh will you take questions if there's
 
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.110 align:start position:0%
uh will you take questions if there's
any

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
anyone uh seeing none uh thank for your
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
perelli need to unmute Mr
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
pelli there you
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
go welcome toar Administration yes we

can hear you yeah thank you hi good
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
morning everyone just wanted to speak in
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
support of this bill U just Echo the
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
comments they already made made great
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
comments All in support of the bill
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the reasons for the emergency
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
order in the first place I just to
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that hospitals weren't
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed um and we've seen an
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
improved situation in Co in the
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
state and
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me um the uh the lockdown
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
seems to have done real number on our
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
society it's caused a lot of uh
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
separation uh issues of mental health
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
job losses um and uh
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
cause people to be separated when onside
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
communities um I think that we have uh
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
We've W our 16th renewal of the
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
emergency order and the next one's
 
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
coming up on Friday and I'm hoping that
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
the governor sees it as a issue for
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to deal with I hope you all
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
see it that way as well perhaps decides
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
not to renew the order um but as regards
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
the hdr2 I think it's a great bill of
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
support um I think that we need to
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
understand as been mentioned before um
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
that uh we're in a better situation than
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
we were initially and it was very common
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
for governors in the
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
beginning see this as a state of
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
emergency and decide to
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
um you know act in you know
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
understandable haste um and they
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
recently preferred looking back and
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
saying that they overreacted over the
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
alternative um and now that we're
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
looking back though we could see that
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
there were some more reactions and how
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
we responded um and now we're at the
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
situation we have vaccines available and
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
we really can't get control over
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
this and as we look forward uh I
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully we all remember that uh while
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
the state has broad police powers to
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
respond to emergencies that threaten
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
public health and safety they're still
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
limited by the US Constitution our own
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
state constitution and laws we have in
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
place um and uh we should all do utmost
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
to avoid abridging citizens rights and
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh with that I'll close my comments
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have any written
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
comments to submit but uh I will get
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
something on an email to all and thank

you thank you uh you don't lose points
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
for not having written testimony
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
you're will you take
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions unfortunately not I'm I'm

you Tammy Clark um chair recognizes
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
unmute there you go good morning can you
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
hear me uh we can thank you and welcome
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I was invited
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
to speak today by representative uh
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa BC and um I just wanted to offer
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
some expert um testimony on the whole
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
issue regarding face masks and the
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory wearing of PPE I am by by
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
career a credentialed OSHA credentialed
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
environmental and occupational health
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
and safety compliance expert I'm a court
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
approved legal expert subject matter
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
expert on all things health safety
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
compliance and PPE related when this
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
when these mandates first came out it
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
was people like me industrial hygienists
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
environmental occupational health and
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
safety professionals that really started
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
speaking up because what we are doing in
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
mandating the forced wearing of face
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
masks really flies in the face of Osha
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
standards for
 
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
example in the workplace in the work
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
environment when there is a known Hazard
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
when there is a risk of Hazard exposure
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
an occupational health and safety expert
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
will do a risk analysis to determine
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
what the employee or what the people are
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
exposed to from that point they follow
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
what is called the hierarchy of safety
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
and controls PPE is always the last line
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
of defense we never ever mandatorily use
 
01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
of defense we never ever mandatorily use
a

01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
one-size one-size blanket one-size
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
fits-all mandate to put people in any
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
type of PPE especially respiratory
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
protection this is the reason OSHA
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
created the respiratory protection
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
standard and the PPE standards in
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
1979 by covering the mouth and nose
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
exerting energy and going about our work
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
tasks we were giving people heart
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
attacks it is very taxing on the
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
cardiopulmonary system to cover the
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
mouth and nose forcibly require someone
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
to go about their their business their
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
work exert energy without controlling
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
the environment temperature humidity and
 
01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:43.719 align:start position:0%
implementing what's called work rest
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
Cycles in other words the covering of
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
the mouth and nose inhibits oxygen
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
intake by up to 20% this is proven and
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
documented by Nash and OSHA's own
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
studies going back to
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
1970 what OSHA has done and what the
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
government has done has bypassed all of
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
the hierarchy of safety and controls and
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
they have completely swept decades worth
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
of Science and data on the wearing of
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
face masks on the use of PPE and they
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
have swept it under the rug as if it
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
does not exist those in my career field
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
have been trying to sound the alarm but
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
we have been silenced there is not one
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienist environmental
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
health and safety professional or
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
occupational health and safety
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
professional or an occupational doctor
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
for that matter on any of these covid-19
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
task force why is that because they
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear from us what we are
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
saying is we are taking the absolute
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
wrong approach and we are creating a
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
greater Hazard for the population not
 
01:27:54.109 --> 01:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
only for working in individuals but also
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
for children the forced wearing of masks
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
is extremely dangerous we know this we
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
have the tests we have the data we have
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
the science we have randomized control
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
tests which is the mother of all
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
scientific tests with meta analysis
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
going back to the early 1970s on all of
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
this and yet they're telling us just
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
cover your mouth and nose with whatever
 
01:28:21.639 --> 01:28:22.590 align:start position:0%
cover your mouth and nose with whatever
cloth

01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
cloth
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
surgical masks homemade face mask it
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter they're telling you that
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
will protect you and it is absolutely
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
false we have test after test after test
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
that show not only does a surgical mask
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
or a cloth mask not protect you from
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
respiratory viral transmission but it
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
also creates a greater
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hazard this is why in a hospital setting
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
doctors nurses and healthcare workers
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
when they wear surgical masks which by
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
the way are not designed or rated to
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
protect against a virus they are only
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
rated to protect against bacterial
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
splashes this is why there is rampant
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
infection among healthc care workers in
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals with respiratory illnesses
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
like influenza flu and things like this
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
they have studied this why is it that
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers are wearing surgical
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
masks yet they pass the flu respiratory
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
illnesses pass like crazy well that's
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
because the PPE that they're wearing is
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
not designed or rated to protect against
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
viral transmission of respiratory
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases so we know we know
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
through testing we know through studies
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
which is very well documented and I will
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
submit in my written
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we cannot use anything
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
that is homemade cloth s surgical masks
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
Etc to protect the wearer or somebody
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
nearby the wearer from the spread of an
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
infectious disease through a viron the
 
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
viruses are so tiny they will pass
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
through the membrane of that material
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
the only PPE that is rated and tested
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
that will what that will knowingly
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
protect the wearer or those nearby the
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
wearer from the spread of infectious
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
disease through Von is what's called a
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
cap APR or a PPR these are the Big
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
Spaceship looking hoods
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
anybody working on an infectious disease
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
Ward you will see them working in these
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
big self-contained
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
respirators they are not wearing
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
surgical masks on infectious disease
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
Wards there's a reason for this so to
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
take this approach that we're just going
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
to mandate everybody wear a face mask is
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
so irresponsible it is so unethical and
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
it drives me crazy because I look around
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
and I see all these kids that are very
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to oxygen saturation and
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
I see all these children wearing face
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
masks I see everyday people walking
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
around in face masks and yet their their
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
um environment is not a microcontrolled
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
environment such as a surgical center or
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
a hospital and this is this is why
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses work in a carefully
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
controlled environment because they are
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
wearing face coverings so the
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
temperature is lower the humidity is
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
lower the oxygen output is higher there
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
are increased additional air cycle
 
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.430 align:start position:0%
are increased additional air cycle
exchanges

01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
for a reason because they're working
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
with their mouth and nose covered even
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
then they have to stop and take work
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
rest Cycles they are trained on how to
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
properly done and do that mask are we
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
all trained in the public no so people
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
are touching these Mas we have to wrap
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
this up a little bit
 
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
this up a little bit
okay

01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
so overall I just wanted to offer my
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
expert professional um testimony because
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
because what these government officials
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
are doing is putting the population at
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
Great risk there's no training for the
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
for the public they are we are seeing
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
the infectious diseases like bacterial
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
pneumonia staff uh perioral dermatitis
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket and that is a direct result of
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and irresponsible
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
mandating of PPE wearing without
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
following the OSHA
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
standards thank you uh will you take
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.510 align:start position:0%

welcome to legislative Administration do
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
you have testimony for us uh yes yes I
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
do I moved here to New Hampshire in 2012
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
for many reasons um one of them was at
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
one time we were considered the state
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
with the most personal Liberties and to
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
me um someone who follow the
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution I like the idea of that um
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
I like what everybody else has said and
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
I would like to talk about what I see um
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
first of all we are live for your die
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
and what I see is uh people are dying in
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
order to be safe but I feel that safety
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
is an illusion I wonder what the
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
statistics are for people who get in
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
their car and drive on the highway
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
what's your what's your uh your sta
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
sorry your chance of being killed while
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
you're in a car anytime you walk outside
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
of your house the the chances of you
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
being killed are much greater than the 0
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
one% I believe from this um virus and
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say I'm a retired teacher
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
from Florida lived there for a while and
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
I think about all those kids I work with
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
special needs kids I I wonder how they
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
are managing to deal with having to have
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
their faces covered these are children
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
already are medically very fragile
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
emotionally very fragile um and that's
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
the thing that makes me the most sad is
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
I see kids I hear about kids harming
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
themselves cutting themselves wanting to
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
kill themselves because they are so
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
socially isolated and they see no future
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
for themselves and and I can understand
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm a member of allanon for quite a
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
few years we are not allowed to get
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
together and have meetings now I know
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
when I was a first time member if I
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't have been in that room with
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
those people holding their hands and
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
getting comfort for them I wouldn't not
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
have made it I probably would have taken
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
my own life things were really bad and I
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
needed those people to be around them
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
and be able to hold their hands and get
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
hugs that's what helped me to recover
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
myself from living with an
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
alcoholic um that's the thing I keep
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about all the kids that are
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
dying the people who are alcoholics who
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
do not get the help I I know of somebody
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
who very on in this uh early on in this
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um took their own life they suffered
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
from depression and they were unable ble
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
to talk to someone in person they took
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
their own life this was a wonderful
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful human being that could not
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
deal with not having anybody to talk to
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
for for how long I I think the governor
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
has gone way too far beyond um it was uh
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
safety under color of law I remember
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
looking that up in the in the very very
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
beginning um and the censorship on
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
social media when you try to find
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
statistics about who's actually dying
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
you can't find it Facebook um was just
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
in Facebook jail for sharing about this
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
virus I don't believe that it's nearly
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
as dangerous as they say that it is um I
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
think that New Hampshire needs to stand
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
up and be an example so the rest of the
 
01:36:37.229 --> 01:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
world can get back to normal perhaps a
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
different kind of normal because I feel
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
we've all learned something um during
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
this we've learned how to be kinded to
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
um but the the kids are suffering kids
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
are are taking their own lives kids are
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
cutting themselves and and I'm not okay
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
with that as a former teacher 15 years
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
the thought about a child killing
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
themselves because they have no future
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
because of this overreach of our
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
governor I I think it needs to stop now
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to be an example for
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country almost 300
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
businesses last I knew had failed in New
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I lost my job as many other
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
people do because of the fear what we
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
need to tell people is that there is
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
nothing to fear so we can get back to
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
normal I'm afraid that if we just say
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay it's over without telling people
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
that it was greatly overinflated the
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
risk like you said you going to drive in
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
a car on the highway in a big city
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
what's your chance of getting killed
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
there I I think it's much greater than
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
the chance of being killed from um a
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
virus and I also concur with all the
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
other statements that I've heard I thank
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
you and I urge you to pass this and let
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
us get back with our lives again thank
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you um are you
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I see no questions um
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimon thank you
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:12.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
Daniel chair would recognize Donald
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you uh my name is Donald
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
McFarland I am a member of the public
 
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
from orange New Hampshire uh and I'm
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
also an experienced professional in risk
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
management and Emergency Management and
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
was an EMT for about a decade while I
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
was living
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I had thought of making a
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
number of points today and many of them
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
if not all of them to some extent have
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
already been
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
covered um so I will appreciate if the
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee would just take note of a few
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
other points that I will throw in that I
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
think amplify some of what has already
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
been said
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
the resolution before
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
you although it does speak to facts that
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
are in evidence as well as uh clear
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
conclusions that that can be drawn with
 
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
really high uh
 
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
probability uh as to whether or not
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
covid constituted an emergency last year
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
constitutes an emergency now uh and
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh Mr sununu's orders
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
were appropriate or not the resolution
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
nevertheless is not about that the
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
resolution is about whether or not we
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
should at this juncture be operating
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
under a
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
monarchy chrisen unu has chosen to
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
ignore the will of the people ignore the
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
will of the
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislature and continue to operate
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
unilaterally for an extraordinarily long
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
period of
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
time and I think when you look at the
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
the fact facts that are in
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
evidence uh from a personal standpoint I
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
was somewhat concerned in the very early
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
part of February uh when the first
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
reports of this virus and this disease
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
started to come in and I started to pay
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
significant attention to it in
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
mid-February and I think anyone else
 
01:40:13.229 --> 01:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
that had been paying attention to what
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
was publicly available without even the
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of whatever additional
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
information may have been available to
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
the governor would have known by the
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
time if not of making his first
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
emergency declaration but certainly by
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the time of making his first extension
 
01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.629 align:start position:0%
the time of making his first extension
to

01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
it that what existed at the time was an
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
emergency that was not what it was
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
claimed that the numbers the statistics
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the epidemiology did not bear out many
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
of the actions that were being taken
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
nevertheless he chose not not to bring
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
it to the attention of the legislature
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
to to make decisions but to make them
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
unilaterally and let's just hypothesize
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
for a second had this been a much worse
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
disease than it is uh and it clearly is
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
a real
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
disease had this been a worse disease
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
had this been everything that it was
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
hyped to be in in February and even into
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
the beginning of March of last
 
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
year the time for the general court to
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
come together and to agree on remote
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
working procedures to agree on how we
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
could continue to have a citizen
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire was then was
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
as early as possible before the disease
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
spread and we see that he chose not to
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
do that either so I think when we look
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
at the circumstance
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
today and we consider the facts that
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
have been set forth already by I think
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
I've agreed with almost every other
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
person testifying uh in the largest part
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the the comment that you
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
just heard about mosqu being ineffectual
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
was something that even as late as May
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
or June of last year I hadn't had
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
occasion to do much research into and I
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
just assumed that they made a modest
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
difference although I was not frankly
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about it because my point of
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
view from the evidence that was clear uh
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
by then was that the spread was
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
predominantly feal oral and feal
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
junctive or not respiratory as the
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
primary mechanism nevertheless if you
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
did believe that respiratory was the
 
01:42:27.719 --> 01:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
did believe that respiratory was the
primary

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism when you do research as I then
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
did on the efficacy of
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
masks what you will find if you choose
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
to actually do the research and look at
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
the randomized clinical TR trials that
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
have been done and and the research
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
papers that have been published well
 
01:42:43.599 --> 01:42:45.310 align:start position:0%
papers that have been published well
before

01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
covid uh and and even as far back as 40
 
01:42:48.159 --> 01:42:48.910 align:start position:0%
covid uh and and even as far back as 40
years

01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
ago is that
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
masks may not even be uh a sop they they
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
may be counterproductive we can see with
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
a Spanish flu that people in some places
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
were being asked to wear masks for years
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
after the flu had
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
circulated and the incidence of various
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
bacterial diseases such as pneumonia
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
increased substantially we have a report
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the UK in 1981 a research paper and
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
a clinical trial a series of clinical
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
trials in fact
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
that was done by Dr Neil or that
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
demonstrated and I will quote from it
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
the conclusion is that the wearing of a
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
mask has very little relevance to the
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
well-being of patients undergoing
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
routine general surgery and it is a
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
standard practice that could be
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
abandoned that's in the surgical theater
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
never mind in the street or in your
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
local donut shop ladies and gentlemen I
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
put it to you that that the you the the
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
testimony you've re you've heard here
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
today has been unanimous and that is
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
quite remarkable but it demonstrates
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
quite how absurd the current situation
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we find ourselves in is and I ask
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
all of the committee to support and to
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
make clear the strength of their support
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
for house concurrent resolution to thank
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony um are
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions yes of
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:22.470 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions yes of
course

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
yet we have no questions um thank you
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
very much for your
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%

behind I ne
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
ne anyo
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
Neo there's

someone willing to
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
accept the chair recognizes someone
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
named Neo
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.070 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes Daniel Richard you

01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
unmute good morning ladies and gentlemen
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
how are you today fine thank you uh
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative Administration
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you let me be
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
brief and get to the points excellent
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
let's look at the scope of the delegated
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
powers the statutes themselves
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and non- delegation
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
Clauses of the Constitution of New
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prohibit the executive from
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
exercising the power of the legislature
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
a closer look at the EMP the Emergency
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Management power statutes is warranted
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
to examine the language and the scope of
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
the EMP statutes in light of the public
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
health laws which has been ignored
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
throughout this crisis were were was
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
this panel aware that New Hampshire has
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
years I'll take that as a no uh we do
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's codified in title 10 New Hampshire
 
01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.790 align:start position:0%
it's codified in title 10 New Hampshire
RSA

01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
141c so let's look at at that and uh and
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
go from there um the emergencies New
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been managing infectious
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
diseases for its entire history our
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
constitution mentions distemper in its
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
in article 43 of part two of our
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
constitution we survived small po fo
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
which was a ruthless killer that killed
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
at a rate of 30% we survived the Spanish
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
flu and many other provision provisions
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
of infectious disease and so including
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
this uh unfortunately the Spanish Flu
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
which was another ruthless killer and so
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
through hundreds of years New Hampshire
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
has codified its Public Health policy
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
for two major reasons number one public
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
health and Public Safety are two
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
different events
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
and they're different for this specific
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
reason a public health event is
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
different because of the cause of action
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
in other words how it how it causes the
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
injury and two the duration and scope
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
which tends to be a long running event
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
and this is why our Public Health policy
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
under 141 has a very has two critical
 
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
elements that have that New Hampshire
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
has been robbed of the governor has
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
taken this from the people by
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
invoking invoking emergency orders where
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
there was already Public Health policy
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
in place and it did two critical things
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
it provided the obligation of the state
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
to protect its citizens in other words
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the probable cause requirements of
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
the state to prove that there's a virus
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the first place and secondarily the
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
due process rights of its citizens so
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
under title 10 the public health
 
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
department is already charged the
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
director of of of our health Public
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
Health already has the ability to
 
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
quarantine people and to manage the
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
virus why why the governor went to the
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
went to the board excuse me went and
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
claimed to the court that he was going
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
to invoke the emergency statutes he
 
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
could have still invoked 445 and
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
declared an emergency and then invoked
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
141 as his authority but he didn't do
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
that the reason he invoked 447 is that
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
he was able to basically tell the the
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
court uh your honor your honor there's a
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
public potential Public Health crisis
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
coming our way but the public health
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
laws that have evolved over hundreds of
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
years they don't matter we're going to
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
throw them out and I'm just going to
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
make up new rules and new guidelines and
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
we've been living with them
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
since the next thing I'd like to say is
 
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
also that the original intention of the
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
emergency statutes Provisions were
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
Justified I'm not going to quibble over
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that no one knew when this
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
virus was first announced what the
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
damage and how it would spread and what
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
the consequences would be so stalling
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
temporarily for a few weeks to get
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
enough PPE in place to uh make sure that
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
our medical infrastructure was was uh
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
not going to collapse on itself was all
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
warranted that this was all legitimate
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
at the at the very first few weeks but
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
moving from there we now have the
 
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.870 align:start position:0%
moving from there we now have the
following

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
consequences so uh let me let me make
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
this point the continued and unlimited
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
renewal of the Emergency Management
 
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
Powers called the EMP statutes have been
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me by the executive branch have
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
caused a constitutional crisis now
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
before this committee as such continued
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
renewal has been used to justify the
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
following State actions separate from
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
the stated purpose of emergency orders
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
the plain excuse me I I'm writing a
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuit here is now deprived of the
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
following constitutional rights and
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
continues to suffer irreparable harm and
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
here's what's going on now we're now
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
being deprived of due process of law
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
we're we've abolished all effective
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
means of redress of grievance we're
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
amending our constitution we're changing
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
our laws changing our voting laws
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
changing our form of government changes
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
to our representation at state and
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
federal level changes to our taxes all
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
these changes are being achieved without
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
the consent of the voters in direct
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
violation of the due process of laws
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution required to
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
amend our
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
constitution so that that's really where
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
we're at now it it I believe that the
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
the concern of an emergency is long
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
passed and now we're causing more damage
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
than than can be justified thank thank
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%

01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
hcr2 my testimony is concerning the
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
closing of the general court or the
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
state house to be
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
for this to be seen we look at calendar
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
House calendar number 12 in a statement
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
made by the last speaker of the house
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
step shirtliff to close the general
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
court this was not lawful in his
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
statement he and the president of the
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
Senate Don ausi were historically I'm
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
quoting them suspending New Hampshire
 
01:52:45.119 --> 01:52:46.830 align:start position:0%
quoting them suspending New Hampshire

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
activities he did not use
Article

01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
Article
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
19 from part two of our Constitution
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
which was to adjourn the house nor did
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
the governor use article
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
43 which was to progue the state so the
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and our house were closed
 
01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
unlawfully this is uncons
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
unconscionable I almost finished here
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
secondly if we the public had our
 
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional redress of grievances
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
back and had a committee to do so it is
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
very likely that the closing of the
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
state would not have gone on for this
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
long we need to open the general court
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
for the people and for our legislators
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
there and we need to do that Pronto we
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
need to re regard our government from
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
here forward as constitutionally sound
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
and in order to do that the voice of the
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
people must be recognized that can only
 
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
be done by by petition or remonstrance
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
as the general court was originally set
 
01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
up and we need once again a redress of

01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any most
 
01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.310 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any most
certainly

01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
I see none in the committee room any on
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%

01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
that you'll think about the public and
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
pass HCI
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
to thank you uh last person testifying I
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
see representative Timothy haran has
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
raised his hands I would include
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aran to keep it short so
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
that uh we can stay on schedule and
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
still have somewhat of a
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
b okay thank you very much Mr chair so
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
I'm president Timothy Horan I represent
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
straford County district 6 which is the
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
town of Madbury home of your
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
distinguished uh ranking uh well home of
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
one of the members of your
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative wall and Durham which
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
actually did eventually get to host uh
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
several sessions of the legisl so I was
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the legislature last year
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
and I would certainly uh disagree with
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker a of
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
characterization of what speaker
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
shirtliff and Senator Susi were doing
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
they very much wanted the uh house and
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
send continue meeting it was not safe to
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
do so in rep Hall rep Hall was uh closed
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
the governor essentially locked us out
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
of the building and actually probably
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
terms of Public Health for good reasons
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
so took a while to figure out how to do
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
it um i Frank Frankly don't think that
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh governor cunu was perhaps terribly
 
01:55:58.589 --> 01:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
help helpful to us or the members of his
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
party in the legislature but I mean
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the past we are where we are
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
now um it we did manage to meet UNH and
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
it was reasonbly successful actually
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
there were some members who uh guess
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the expectations of unh
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
behaved in ways that uh other people on
 
01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
the UNH campus are not allowed to do um
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
but um I certainly we were caught off
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
guard with this nobody expected this but
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
um I state of emergency was very uh
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely Justified um I think uh I
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
think we still haven't processed just
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
how bad it is um like there's common you
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
know we've had at least half a million
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
dead but that's the biggest catastrophe
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
in US history but I think um we still
 
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
haven't quite process how bad it is
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of comment says I'm a
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
person in my 60s so I'm not that old but
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of older where they talk about
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
these death rates and so like
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
99.9% and you know 75 you know like like
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
in my age bracket it's
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
99.5% which I guess the idea is so
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
trivial we shouldn't be doing it now
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's one in 200 um I
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
I I would like to think I have more than
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
one to 200 chance of uh you know
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
surviving surviving through the next
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
next year or so so that's so
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um it's just very it's just very
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
serious and frightening thing and the
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
legislature had a hard time dealing
 
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with it but I don't think this
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
resolution is at all helpful and the
 
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
state of emergency it was absolutely was
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
justified do I support how senu went
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
about it um for the most part no on the
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
one hand I thought he was didn't inde I
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
agree with those who said he acted
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally although I personally
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
think he probably should have been even
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
tougher and had even um more
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions um at least at least terms
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
of more not really restrictions but more
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
precautions should have been taken so
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
that and they should have been more
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
strictly enforced so I would uh I just
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
say this resolution is uh so I would
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
just advise you U vote against this uh
 
01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
vote against this resolution so I don't
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
endorse houseu did it but or nor I
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
endorse everything he did but I think um
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
I think on balance the governor should
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
have that power and certainly it's not
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
fair to blame the legislature for the
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
fact that we um met only sporadically
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
last year um well one other thing I will
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
say is that we did attempt to pass a uh
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative continuity and
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
it never met but that was uh partially
 
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
was introduced a little bit late in the
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
process but I think um revenue shirtliff
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
and Senator Su made very much of a good
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
faith effort to keep the institutions
 
01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
running and U Know un balance uh
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
unbalance um I was surprised by how well
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
we coped so um that's Bas my testimony
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you I have to take any
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
questions anybody wants to but I
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
definitely think this res resolution is
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
is totally it's just a very bad
 
01:58:55.069 --> 01:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
resolution and it should be ited
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously in my opinion so have to
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you uh seeing
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
No Hands raised I appreciate your
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh with that I will close
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
there are no other hands we good to
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
go no that's
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
didn't quite catch the numbers on the
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
support and oppos what was that again
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
295 to what
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
295 in support and 85 against Great
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think we have a couple
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
minutes before we open the hearing on
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
the next bill so I just wanted to let
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
anyone that is
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
on line and
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
listening to know that the calendar I
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
wrote this little blurb the plan is to
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
listen to the introduction of each of
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bills at the time stated in the
 
02:09:09.390 --> 02:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
calendar each bill will have 15 minutes
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
of time to be introduced by the sponsors
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
and post sponsors at the end of that 15
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
minutes the hearing on that bill will be
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
continued until after lunch at
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
1:00 beginning at 1:00 members of the
 
02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.709 align:start position:0%
1:00 beginning at 1:00 members of the
public

02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
will testify on any of the continued
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
bills they will be called upon and they
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
will state the particular bill they are
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
testifying about is expected that due to
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of people testifying we will
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
be limiting the testimony to as few as
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
two minutes per speaker I'm not sure if
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's true based on what I see already
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
on signing in I I'm not not sure that
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
there will be a limit um we will be
 
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get as many folks to give
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
their verbal testimony giving us their
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony as possible but I would
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
suggest that to everyone that written
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
testimony will always be accepted and
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
read by the committee members up until
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
midnight tonight and the address for
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%

legislative

02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
Administration I am Andrew Prout
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro County District
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
37 the towns of Hudson and
 
02:11:12.549 --> 02:11:12.559 align:start position:0%
pelum the intent of this bill is to
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that the legislature is not
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
unable to utilize its power to declare
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
or terminate a state of emergency do the
 
02:11:22.589 --> 02:11:22.599 align:start position:0%
inability to gather 400 members and meet
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner nor the chair's
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to do so the bill would
 
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
allow members of the legislature to file
 
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
a petition with the clerk of their
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
chamber in a like manner to the petition
 
02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:36.559 align:start position:0%
authorized by RSA 16 to call for a
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
special session of the
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislature if initiated by the required
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
number in composition of members it
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
would be balloted by mail and assuming
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
that a majority of members responded
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
responded in the affirmative be the same
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a resolution passed pursuant to the
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
statutory authority of RSA 445 or 490
 
02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
6-a these sections permit the
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
Declaration or termination of a state of
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
emergency or the termination of a
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
Judicial emergency order under a state
 
02:12:06.599 --> 02:12:08.229 align:start position:0%
Judicial emergency order under a state
of

02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
emergency while I do think that some of
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
the emergency planning that has been
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
done in the past has considered the
 
02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
possibility that the legislature may be
 
02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
unable to meet in saying that I'm
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
thinking both about RSA 445s lack of
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
limitation on renewals of states of
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
emergency and the Constitution's part
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
second article 5A related to enemy
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
attack I think the state of emergency we
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
are wrapping up just now was quite
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
different than contemplated by the
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
Crafters of those
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
sections there was no nuclear attack as
 
02:12:41.549 --> 02:12:41.559 align:start position:0%
I think article 5A feared and no mass
 
02:12:43.069 --> 02:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
destruction of the Civil infrastructure
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
as I think RSA 445
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
contemplated the male still works
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
a bit a bit slow in some places for
 
02:12:50.239 --> 02:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
a bit a bit slow in some places for
unrelated

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
unrelated
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
reasons we have zoom fax machines and
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
scan PDF documents
 
02:12:59.069 --> 02:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
now I also want to ensure the committee
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
is aware that several be bills are being
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
heard this morning in Edna that would
 
02:13:04.990 --> 02:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
limit the executive authority to renew
 
02:13:06.549 --> 02:13:06.559 align:start position:0%
states of emergency
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
indefinitely these bills would require
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to act a continuous
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
state of
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
emergency this bill HB
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
277 would provide a process for the
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislature to act without assembling in
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
one place to meet the new Duty that
 
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
these bills would
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
impose I already mentioned RSA 16's
 
02:13:26.589 --> 02:13:26.599 align:start position:0%
process for calling a special session as
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
an example of the legislature doing
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
business without meeting but I also want
 
02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:32.599 align:start position:0%
to draw the committee's attention to the
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution part second article 49- a
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
which has a provision for the
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
legislature acting by and I quote
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
written request of at least one quarter
 
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the members end
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
quote we may not have any constitutional
 
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions for meeting over Zoom
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
but the Constitution does already
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
contemplate us acting remotely by
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
written request like in this
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your time
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
consideration I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
have thank for your testimony
 
02:14:06.549 --> 02:14:06.559 align:start position:0%
um you are submitting written testimony
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
I assume I I can I I can submit the same
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
I I uh just gave in written form as well
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
perfect um are there any questions by
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
any question up representative
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
Le uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking the
 
02:14:27.149 --> 02:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
question I just want to be sure I
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
understand the the the purpose or the
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
the goal of of HB 277 so it is simply
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
that um a following the standard
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
procedure for a petition if the petition
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
is then voted on uh remotely you know
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
via the mail or whatever balloted that
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
way and the petition is supported by a
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
majority of the chamber then it is to be
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
considered as equivalent to passage of a
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
resolution ending the in this case
 
02:14:54.549 --> 02:14:54.559 align:start position:0%
probably ending a state of emergency is
 
02:14:54.559 --> 02:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
probably ending a state of emergency is
that

02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct that was correct it is uh would
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
apply to both declaring ending and also
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
the other section ending a Judicial
 
02:15:05.069 --> 02:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
emergency order so any of the three
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
statutory ways to statutory triggers for
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
resolution okay thank you yeah I just
 
02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understood it
 
02:15:11.079 --> 02:15:12.990 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understood it
thank

02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
questions

you

02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the interim I will say that if anyone
 
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
signed on at 11:15 waiting to hear House
 
02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:05.270 align:start position:0%
signed on at 11:15 waiting to hear House
Bill

02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
280 that the plan is for the prime
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors to introduce the bill and then
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing um on that bill
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
until 1:00 when members of the public
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
Haven all the same
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
top never done they just it may it's
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
hardest on the clerk right I mean she
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't know at that point when
 
02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't know at that point when
someone's

02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
testifying which Bill they're testifying
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
on so that's going to be the hardest
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
part that we try to do but otherwise
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're getting all of similar testimony
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.519 --> 02:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
same

02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
top of bills
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
simar bill and the public speaks and
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
speaks then they say the same thing to
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
the next bill so this is better this way
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
because it's more efficient you get the
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
hearings and everyone gets to you know
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
if they have someone say we all speaking
 
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.830 align:start position:0%
if they have someone say we all speaking
on

02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
HC speak such such saying similar things
 
02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
it's even more complicated because Edna
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
is having similar bills as well so it's
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
um trying to just give a broad amount of
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
time that someone could raise their hand
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
and speak from one o00 on yeah and not
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
have an issue I think I may have
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
misspoke I think I closed I bill 277
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
when I should have
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
o' just recess
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%

which is relative to termination of an
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
emergency order issued by the governor
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%

02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Andrew Prout representing Hillsboro
 
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
County District 37 the towns of Hudson
 
02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
County District 37 the towns of Hudson
and

02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
pelum this bill would give the
 
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
legislature statutory authority to
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
determinate any specific emergency order
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
or any part of one by the resolution
 
02:20:48.670 --> 02:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
process in RSA 4
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
45 current law allows only for the
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
termination of the entire state of
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
emergency and every emergency order
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
issued thereunder in an All or Nothing
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
fashion this bill would allow for a more
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
nuanced approach to address things the
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislature May disagree
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
with I'd like to draw the committee's
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
attention to RSA 490 colon 6A which
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
deals with judicial emergency orders
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
issued during a state of emergency under
 
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
that existing law the legislature
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
already has the ability to pass nuanced
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
per order concurrent resolutions
 
02:21:24.270 --> 02:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
terminating judicial emergency
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
orders this bill would simply extend
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
that concept to Executive emergency
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
orders as
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your time
 
02:21:33.389 --> 02:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
consideration I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%

02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
comfort to know how many people spoke in
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%

of emergency by a simple resolution I

recognize FR sponsor no the one of the

the record I am Andrew Prout
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro County District
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
37 the towns of Hudson and pelum
 
02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
standing in for the prime sponsor
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tony lickus who is
 
02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
attending to his committee this
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
morning this bill would change the
 
02:30:33.269 --> 02:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
authority to terminate a state terminate
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
states of emergency or judicial
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
emergency orders from a concurrent
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
resolution passed by both chambers of
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature to a simple resolution
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
passed by either
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
chamber The Authority for the
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to declare a state of emerc
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mercy would remain a concurrent
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
resolution part 2 Article 2 of our
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
constitution says the supreme
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislative power within this state
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
shall be vested in the Senate and House
 
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
of Representatives Each of which shall
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
have a negative on the
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
other in short it takes both chambers of
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature to agree to do
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
something conversely it should only take
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
one of the chambers saying
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
no to stop
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
something during the State of Emergency
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
the executive and judicial branches have
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
vast authority to act under RSA 445 and
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
490 col
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
6-a however we should not forget that
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
this Authority is not theirs it is the
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislator's authority that we have
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
delegated to them to manage the
 
02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
emergency situation in a more realtime
 
02:31:41.550 --> 02:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
manner than we customarily
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
operate the House and Senate should
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
still have a negative upon each other in
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
regards to this delegation of authority
 
02:31:50.269 --> 02:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
and this bill would restore
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your time and
 
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
consideration I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have thank
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um any questions within the committee
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
room I'm seeing none any I do see a hand
 
02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
raised representative
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um you mentioned the the
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
two legislative Chambers uh having a
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
negative on each other I'm curious how
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
operating under this
 
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um one chamber could disent
 
02:32:25.389 --> 02:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
from the other if what like if the
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
Senate decides that they want to end a
 
02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and the house
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
that so uh there's I guess a couple
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
different aspects to what you just asked
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
um first the way I view the delegation
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
of state of emergency power that we have
 
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
in exist law is it's the legislature has
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
basically given its Advance approval
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that it can't act in a
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
timely manner during an emergency or a
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
timely enough Manner and therefore the
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
other branches of government may take
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
certain actions approved in advance um
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
you asked about how the house or one
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
chamber would descend from the other in
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
continuing state of emergency which
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
almost implies the authority to to
 
02:33:13.269 --> 02:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency which would
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
under this remain a concurrent
 
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
resolution therefore require both
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
Chambers voting yes what this
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislation would do is say the
 
02:33:24.269 --> 02:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
authority to end a state of emergency is
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
either chamber saying no and I would an
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
an analogize what this bill does to
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawing consent so either chamber of
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature withdrawing consent to a
 
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
state of emergency continuing would stop
 
02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
it that if that answers your question it
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
does thank
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%

02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
go we have nothing going until one
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock so you have an hour for lunch
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
at yes do we have any do you have any
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
sort of sense of how many people are
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
planning to testify I mean is it a lot
 
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
is it on on these four the only only
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing I have are the um are the sign-ins
 
02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
and and so far there have been none my
 
02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
my suspicion is my suspicion is that
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
um that when the other when Edna stops
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
their hearings that um there'll be a a
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
migration of people testifying on that
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
side because they're going into a work
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
session I think this afternoon and so so
 
02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
it was kind of designed so that we could
 
02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
then go to they would be able to testify
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
on any of these where they were
 
02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
testifying on those in the morning I see
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you does that sound Reon I mean I
 
02:49:32.229 --> 02:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't have any way of knowing obviously
 
02:49:35.950 --> 02:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
other than that so um it may be an early
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then we start right in at
 
02:49:42.030 --> 02:49:42.040 align:start position:0%

extended

03:58:53.710 --> 03:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
recess so far we have one
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%

03:59:11.439 --> 03:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:49.389 align:start position:0%
 
something

03:59:49.389 --> 03:59:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%

101
 
04:01:52.269 --> 04:01:52.279 align:start position:0%

04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%

am representative are you there here I
 
04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
am I put on the tie at lunchtime so I I
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly don't plan to use the
 
04:02:21.389 --> 04:02:21.399 align:start position:0%
full two hours I have better things to
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
do with the two hours than uh listen to
 
04:02:26.110 --> 04:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
my self talk and you probably feel even
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
more so that way so I continue to be
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Oregon I
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
represent straford County District Six
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
the towns of Durham and Madbury so I'd
 
04:02:38.590 --> 04:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
like to uh speak in opposition to the uh
 
04:02:40.710 --> 04:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
bills that we heard uh bills of this
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee heard heard this morning like
 
04:02:45.070 --> 04:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh all three or four of them I've lost
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
track of how many there are can you um
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
can you limit for the clerk for the
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the clerk making notes here
 
04:02:58.269 --> 04:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
can you late your comments by by
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
Bill sure oh that's that's doable let me
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh P up the uh agenda here to see which
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
was which okay
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:09.389 align:start position:0%
was which okay
uh

04:03:09.389 --> 04:03:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
I've got print outs of some of them
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
so so the first 277 then we went to 280
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
um problem with 277 is I think this was
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
um 27 with 277 I guess is one of the
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
ones allow just one branch of the
 
04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to terminate the state of E
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
emergency and that's unwise because uh
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
that effectively gives 13 Senators a
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
veto over the Govern the policy to
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
terminate the state of emergency and
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's a problem with some of the others
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
um especi well the spend and especially
 
04:03:56.590 --> 04:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
the small bodies with thetically it's 13
 
04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
the same could happen in the uh same
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
could happen in the house especially if
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
we do it during the current emergency
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
where we still really haven't figured
 
04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
out how to meet we had what I I think we
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
all agree is a pretty chaotic two days
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
session last year so there's no
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee that uh that who shows up so
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a possibility you
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
could have a group that's large enough
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
that more than the 200 needed for a quum
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
but still like not really like represent
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
a cross-section of the of the house
 
04:04:24.750 --> 04:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
showing up to terminate a state of
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
emergency that might actually still have
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh might actually still have broad
 
04:04:29.279 --> 04:04:30.469 align:start position:0%
uh might actually still have broad
support

04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and that's uh also a problem with 325
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
so that's big flaw with big flaw with
 
04:04:44.110 --> 04:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
IG fall with both of those see um in
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
hoopersville the last one which nobody
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
all came to speak and that requires a
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution that's a little
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
bit more problematic but even then and
 
04:04:53.950 --> 04:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
of course that want to also the state of
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
emergency expires after 21 days which is
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
an unreasonably short time um even when
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
there isn't a pandemic even when people
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
aren't scared for their lives you know
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
even when every aspect of our life
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't been turned upside down so
 
04:05:08.030 --> 04:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
especially now those are all um un
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
realistic expectations and I
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
U also like to go ahead and uh once
 
04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
again defend I think the leadership of
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
the last uh legislature they've been
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh they've been kind of given rather
 
04:05:23.149 --> 04:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
shabby treatment in retrospect you know
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
they've been accused of just walking
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
away from their job and nothing can be
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
farther from the truth so I I know for a
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
fact that they both worked very very
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
hard to keep the institution going um
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
with and frankly with no help from the
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
governor's office at all as far as I
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
could tell I'm sure there's more going
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not privy to a lot of what was going
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
on just but what I could see is a
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
veteran member um who's fairly involved
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the legisl who at least uh tries to
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
stay involved in the legislative process
 
04:05:51.149 --> 04:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
I saw very little support coming from
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
the uh from the governor so it was
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
mostly uh the uh the majority leadership
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
especially of the house trying to keep
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
things going and they uh they did keep
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
things going but it took a it was a
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
struggle and we're still not back up to
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
capacity so uh I uh I I think all all
 
04:06:10.590 --> 04:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
three of these are bad it's very
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh it's very dangerous to give
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
one house of the one chamber of the
 
04:06:17.070 --> 04:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislature the chance to over you know
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
terminate a state of emergency uh
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
for for not necessarily any good reason
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
at all the state of emergency that we're
 
04:06:26.189 --> 04:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
all still living under we've been living
 
04:06:28.110 --> 04:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
under for almost a year I don't
 
04:06:29.710 --> 04:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with everything of it
 
04:06:32.189 --> 04:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't disagree with I
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly don't agree with every aspect
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
of how the governor handled it but I
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
think um I think the precautions if
 
04:06:40.349 --> 04:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
anything were have not been strict
 
04:06:43.469 --> 04:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
enough so even though um it's also worth
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
noting that you know the great mass of
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
the people the people who don't pay any
 
04:06:48.670 --> 04:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
attention to what we're doing here in
 
04:06:50.429 --> 04:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
conquer or Bedford or wherever it is
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're located at the moment um most of
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
them they're they seem to be
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh they seem to be you
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
know appropriately scared by what's
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
going on they see they're taking you
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
know appropriate precautions to go to a
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh like for example you go in any store
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
people are staying six feet apart they
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
are messed up they are even fing the
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
little green arrows on the floor of the
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
Market Basket so for the most part the
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know the people are taking this
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
very seriously so the people who we
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
serve I think they almost seem to
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
understand it more than those of us in
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature do to a certain extent
 
04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
so I I I so I think uh so I think uh
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
this is not I think this is not a good
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
idea to uh you know make it too easy to
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
terminate a state of emergency I me I
 
04:07:36.429 --> 04:07:36.439 align:start position:0%
could imagine certainly a governor could
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
could abuse it and
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
think there's we don't need to pass
 
04:07:42.030 --> 04:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
these bills we still have also plenty of
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
other tools in Arsenal in case some
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
future Governor to totally abuses it but
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's the situation to
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
here and I certainly speak of someone
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
who's not at all a fan of Governor cunu
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I definitely U you know I I'm not a
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
big fan of how he's been handling things
 
04:07:59.550 --> 04:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
but I do think uh I do think the state
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
of emergency was was appropriate and um
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
and uh I Al once again I'd like and I I
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
do think uh I think these bills are a
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
bad idea so I'd be happy to take any
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you for your
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I will ask if there are any
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
questions in the committee room for
 
04:08:18.439 --> 04:08:21.389 align:start position:0%
questions in the committee room for
representative

04:08:21.389 --> 04:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.670 --> 04:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
par Mr represent par you said all three
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
of these are B does that mean you're not
 
04:08:27.550 --> 04:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
speaking on the other two that you
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
spoken for everything or what oh well
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly how to do we're
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
hearing all three so I'm I'm not opposed
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
to passing uh any of those bills that we
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
heard this morning so I don't know uh
 
04:08:42.149 --> 04:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
like I'm not sure exactly how to go
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
about saying it but we're having a joint
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on the four
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
bills so all four you are you are
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
registering opposition yes exactly guess
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully that's an adequate
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
answer thank
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
you um any further questions any
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%

circumstances and uh try not to freeze
 
04:09:19.149 --> 04:09:19.159 align:start position:0%

here we've still not heard from
representative

04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative

representative
Hopper

04:09:33.550 --> 04:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
Hopper
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor of
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
559 me I think his own committee is
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
meeting today so that could be where he
 
04:09:43.229 --> 04:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
is but I don't I'm just
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
speculating he's in criminal justice now
 
04:09:48.269 --> 04:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
right yes are they meeting
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
know they are they are
 
04:10:00.479 --> 04:10:03.389 align:start position:0%
know they are they are
meeting

04:10:03.389 --> 04:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
meeting

forward in part because of my
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
constituents I had people all during
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
this this epidemic calling me and saying
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
what are you doing why why aren't you
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
people legislators doing anything about
 
04:25:00.640 --> 04:25:02.590 align:start position:0%
people legislators doing anything about
the

04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um what a lot of people see are very
 
04:25:08.590 --> 04:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
oppressive Decisions by the governor I
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
think uh um executive order
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
76 where
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
he um ignored State Statute and created
 
04:25:22.269 --> 04:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
a database for people getting
 
04:25:25.630 --> 04:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinated which went against
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh um article 2B of the State
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution which is a right to privacy
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
which we we voted in by an 80% majority
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
just District in
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
2018 and he ignored rsas which say
 
04:25:47.830 --> 04:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
people can opt out of being in a vaccine
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
um registry so he he basically discarded
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
the law and ignored the Constitution and
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
there was another uh executive orders my
 
04:26:01.469 --> 04:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
uh voters had problems with and it
 
04:26:05.309 --> 04:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
seems not necessarily now but if you if
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
you look around the country and look at
 
04:26:11.469 --> 04:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
California where the the uh governor of
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
California is creating uh Draconian
 
04:26:17.710 --> 04:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
executive orders then having a dinner at
 
04:26:20.109 --> 04:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
a fancy restaurant with dozens of his
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
rich friends without masks on so telling
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
the people of California you have to do
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
this and he does whatever he
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
wants um it seems to me that that type
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
of behavior could easily happen in New
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the way executive
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
orders are in place
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.680 --> 04:26:47.469 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:52.030 --> 04:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
um 559 five that's a good number
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
559 is intended so that if we have a
 
04:26:59.109 --> 04:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
governor that oversteps his bounds we
 
04:26:59.119 --> 04:27:00.030 align:start position:0%
governor that oversteps his bounds we
the

04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
legislature have the ultimate say on
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
whether to to uh continue or discontinue
 
04:27:09.630 --> 04:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
so in this case when he signs an
 
04:27:12.429 --> 04:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
executive order in a certain amount of
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
days the legislature would have to
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
convene and vote to continue or not
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
continue through through a concurrent
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
resolution and if there is no vote of
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature then the executive or
 
04:27:27.070 --> 04:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
order dies
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
a a timely death that's basically it so
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature that because you we all
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
know our voters we all know that they
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
you know they feel comfortable talking
 
04:27:40.149 --> 04:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
to us in the
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
supermarket and if they're really
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
upset we should have a an opportunity to
 
04:27:49.269 --> 04:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
chime in on executive orders and if the
 
04:27:50.910 --> 04:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
governor believes that an executive
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
order is absolutely necessary then he
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to convince us as
 
04:27:58.750 --> 04:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
legislators that that's the case so that
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
when our uh a constituent comes up to me
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
says why aren't you doing acts I can say
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
well the we had a discussion with with
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
about that in the legislature and the
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
government made this compelling argument
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so we're extending it for another 28
 
04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
days so that's the intent is just so
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
that um the people still have a say in
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
government even during an executive
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
order because right now I know uh
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
constituents who have called the
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
governor tried to talk to the governor
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
and they get zero response so I think
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
this um allows them to people of New
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
say in these uh very difficult times
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
because I think one of the the um some
 
04:28:48.189 --> 04:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
of the Fallout of
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 is the
 
04:28:55.469 --> 04:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
um people's inability to have control
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
they feel like they've lost control of
 
04:29:01.389 --> 04:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
their government and that's not an
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable condition in a to Live Free
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
or Die State I'll give I'll give you a
 
04:29:09.070 --> 04:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
simple example when the governor signed
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
the I believe it was the first executive
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
order that um had churches all shut down
 
04:29:18.910 --> 04:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
one of the consequences of that was that
 
04:29:21.790 --> 04:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
every 12-step meeting in the state shut
 
04:29:25.630 --> 04:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
down you had an ENT you in in a crisis
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
situation we have
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
now it is very very difficult for people
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
who are struggling with addiction and so
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
when the one form of support that isn't
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
government supported it's all volunteer
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
that that entire swap of help that was
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
out there was killed instantly because
 
04:29:50.830 --> 04:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
all of almost all of those 12 step and
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh 12-step type meetings AA na ha
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
all of those meetings or almost all of
 
04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
those meetings take place in churches
 
04:30:03.149 --> 04:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
and they were all killed all at once the
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
number of people relapsing we talk about
 
04:30:07.109 --> 04:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
about the the number of people dying
 
04:30:09.070 --> 04:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
from covid I don't know what the number
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
of people dying from overdose right now
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
but it's really high I also know that
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the number of people relapsing and and
 
04:30:18.590 --> 04:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
um having you know suicide and
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
everything else has gone through the
 
04:30:19.960 --> 04:30:21.309 align:start position:0%
everything else has gone through the
roof

04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
roof
 
04:30:24.990 --> 04:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
so by Intro by passing this law where
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
the legislators can hear from their
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
communities come in and um support or
 
04:30:36.670 --> 04:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
reject a uh an emergency order
 
04:30:39.109 --> 04:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
I think will give um make the governor
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
more account the governor more
 
04:30:44.590 --> 04:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
accountable to the people and the people
 
04:30:46.590 --> 04:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
more uh us more accountable to the
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
people also which is kind of the point
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
of um what we do for work really I think
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you for your testim that
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
was that an hour and
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
15 minutes um has uh you have any time
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
for questions sure
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
anyone in the committee have
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions anyone on Zoom have questions
 
04:31:14.950 --> 04:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
I have
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
one um you stated in your testimony that
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
feeling like they're not being heard or
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
they have no opportunity for for being
 
04:31:34.109 --> 04:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
heard um we have five bills here on
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
Solutions all the dealing with emergency
 
04:31:37.080 --> 04:31:38.630 align:start position:0%
Solutions all the dealing with emergency
Powers

04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
Powers
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
um in total of the five we have
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.399 --> 04:31:50.109 align:start position:0%
 
testifying

04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
um either four or against total of four
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
so so does that not apply the the idea
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
that people want to have their voices
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
heard or are they requesting for you to
 
04:32:08.229 --> 04:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
be their
 
04:32:11.830 --> 04:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
voice um no I I uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe that is particularly
 
04:32:18.189 --> 04:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
relevant in in criminal justice we get a
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony we had a bill a few
 
04:32:23.469 --> 04:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
minutes ago where 400 people chimed in
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
not they didn't talk but they right but
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's because those are well publicized
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
bills there's advocacy
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
groups um that uh Jin up support or Jin
 
04:32:35.239 --> 04:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
groups um that uh Jin up support or Jin
up

04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
people to fight back against a bill ab
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
and C in a little while we got a
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill I know there's a lot of
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
people who want to speak on
 
04:32:51.109 --> 04:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
that how straight they will be when they
 
04:32:53.590 --> 04:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
speak is another question but anyway
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of advocacy groups for for
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
different things that we hear up here in
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature I don't think there's um
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
the same kind of infrastructure for
 
04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
bills such as this that
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
um um to talk about uh
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
um emergency orders and things like that
 
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a new phenomenon so there's
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe there's that kind of
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
support to notify people things and I
 
04:33:22.439 --> 04:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
support to notify people things and I
certainly

04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
didn't uh did not do a good job telling
 
04:33:30.269 --> 04:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
anybody about this so it's partially my
 
04:33:30.279 --> 04:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
anybody about this so it's partially my
fault

04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
fault
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
I as a followup these all have indicated
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
support for um somewhere close to 200
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
people have have signed on to
 
04:33:52.269 --> 04:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
support um these five bills yeah but yet
 
04:33:56.590 --> 04:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
only four wanted to
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:03.869 --> 04:34:03.879 align:start position:0%
Shan yeah I I don't know I have a heart
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I it was just asking for your
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
impression or or your idea of whether
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
you think that there is a low minority
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
or whether you think that um your bill
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
is necessary because there are so many
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
people wanted you to represent them in
 
04:34:25.000 --> 04:34:27.109 align:start position:0%
people wanted you to represent them in
this

04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:27.119 --> 04:34:28.709 align:start position:0%
this
action

04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure it's
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
relevant if if the you know it's like uh
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
in a and the Declaration of Independence
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
says we hold these truths to be
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
self-evident I think that the need for
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
self-evident the idea that
 
04:34:45.561 --> 04:34:47.070 align:start position:0%
self-evident the idea that
um

04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:49.629 --> 04:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh that we could end up with a governor
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
like Nome who could just keep hammering
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
us with executive orders and the
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislature has no
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
recourse to uh to put a put a put the
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
breakes on I think it's self-evident
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
that we need to do something
 
04:35:07.709 --> 04:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
all we have to do is look around the
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
country today and we know we need to do
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
something now if the E executive orders
 
04:35:15.551 --> 04:35:15.561 align:start position:0%
are legitimate and there's ample uh
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
reason to uh maintain them or to to uh
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
resubmit them then the legisl
 
04:35:25.230 --> 04:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
legislature will vote to support it
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so it doesn't do any harm it only
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
um um allows the people to have more of
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
a voice in what's going on in their own
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
State because right now under an
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
executive order like I said the governor
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
specifically has ignored
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
law basically you know just wiped it out
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure that's the place for
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
an executive order and and if he had to
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature and say and and
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
we ask why are you doing this why is
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
this necessary at least he would have a
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of justification for
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
it so I I think this is self evident I
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't think I need five million people

that I speak to and see around that's
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%

04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
what is our legislative doing what is
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%

about how it works how it doesn't work
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people just feel that our
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights in in the granite
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%

04:43:44.430 --> 04:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the game Gary no one knows where the
 
04:43:46.830 --> 04:43:46.840 align:start position:0%

04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
we go to the store and
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
someone po before this pandemic and
 
04:44:42.910 --> 04:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
someone was coughing or sick we would
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
steer away from those people just like
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
our grandmothers used to tell us if
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
someone has a running issue or they're
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
coughing stay away from those people we
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
know how to to protect ourselves and
 
04:44:54.990 --> 04:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's not that we want you to do
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
something we want you to do the right
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
thing which is not to trample on our
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights on our state
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
rights that's really what we're we're
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
after we're just we're we're kind of
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
appalled we're like what are these
 
04:45:09.868 --> 04:45:09.878 align:start position:0%
people doing and then it's day after day
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
after day it seemed at the beginning
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
there was just more mandates More
 
04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
Everything happening and we're like when
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
is this going to stop and now that we I
 
04:45:20.830 --> 04:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to say we fully know about
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
covid but uh we have a greater
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
understanding now these things need to
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
be um we need to open our state back up
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
we really do we need to follow the
 
04:45:32.270 --> 04:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
example of Ronda santis in Florida and
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
just do what he do he does I'm I'm I
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
like uh Governor sonunu I really do I
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
obviously voted for him um I believed in
 
04:45:42.030 --> 04:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of what he's doing but then when
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
this happened it's like what who is he
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
getting counsel from who who is who is
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh having him think these would be good
 
04:45:53.470 --> 04:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
measures to take and we're we're just
 
04:45:55.150 --> 04:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
all sort of Blown Away scratching our
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
head saying we live in the Live Free or
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
Die State and we can't go to the store
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
or go to church or or if we do we have
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
to stay six feet away from people and
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's really odd it really is
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
we'd like it to be all reversed and just
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
go back to the way it
 
04:46:17.550 --> 04:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
was I think we all agree on that um
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%

langa Lang thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:59:23.190 --> 05:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
commit members for taking my testimony
 
05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Tim Lang I uh
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Tilton and S hton
 
05:59:30.990 --> 05:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
bellnap 4 um presenting before you House
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 389 House Bill 389 is a response to
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
the uh state of emergency I understand
 
05:59:38.830 --> 05:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
you've been listening about that all day
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
long so I won't go into to the details
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
of RSA 445 so I'm sure you're probably
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
more conversent at this point than I am
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
um what this bill seeks to do is uh
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
create a little check and balance uh as
 
05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
we saw in this latest state of emergency
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the legislature played almost zero
 
05:59:57.150 --> 05:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
role in what happened with the state of
 
05:59:58.990 --> 05:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
emergency and this is the first time the
 
06:00:00.750 --> 06:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
state of emergency law has been put into
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
effect and basically I'm you know we're
 
06:00:05.230 --> 06:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
doing a Lessons Learned here uh one of
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
the things we learned is that the
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislature should be involved in these
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
processes and have a little bit of
 
06:00:11.310 --> 06:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
oversight over what's going on in the
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
governor's office um to that end I
 
06:00:15.868 --> 06:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
created this bill and what this bill
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
does is it creates a legislative
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
emergency uh executive orders oversight
 
06:00:23.070 --> 06:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee at the beginning of each term
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
10 members of the house or 10 members of
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature four from the Senate six
 
06:00:29.310 --> 06:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
from the the house would be appointed to
 
06:00:32.590 --> 06:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
a a committee that committee will if in
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
the case of a state of emergency uh the
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
committee's responsibility is to review
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's and approve the renewal
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
of emergency orders so we recognize that
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
the governor needs to be able to manage
 
06:00:46.030 --> 06:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
the process especially when things are
 
06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
moving fast so the first 21 days he gets
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
a pass um he gets to be able to write
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
his executive order and and and have and
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
take action but after the 21 days the or
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
or before that expire is if he wants to
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
renew that order he must bring it before
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh legislative emergency uh
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
oversight committee executive order
 
06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um and the committee
 
06:01:08.868 --> 06:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
will review the order and decide whether
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
or not it should move forward or not in
 
06:01:13.270 --> 06:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
the case of a TI Vote or a majority vote
 
06:01:15.548 --> 06:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
it would uh move forward the the the
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
order would stay in place in the case of
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
a a vote to override or veto if you will
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
the governor's emergency order that
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
would be in place the governor would be
 
06:01:27.788 --> 06:01:27.798 align:start position:0%
able to reissue the emergency order if
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
it substantially changes so the order
 
06:01:30.868 --> 06:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
would have to be could be on the same
 
06:01:32.350 --> 06:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
subject matter would have to be a little
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
bit different um or if he wants to bring
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
the same order back 10 days after it
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
expires for whatever reason he can go
 
06:01:39.510 --> 06:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
back again in front of the committee and
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
asks to renew that um that executive
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
order again um there's a second half of
 
06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
this uh law after the uh creation of the
 
06:01:51.590 --> 06:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh committee and this was in response to
 
06:01:53.868 --> 06:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
some when I originally was floating this
 
06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
idea we had a working group as as I'm
 
06:01:57.070 --> 06:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
sure you heard working on a bunch of
 
06:01:59.468 --> 06:01:59.478 align:start position:0%
these bills and there was some concern
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
about just having 10 members a super
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee if you will without that what
 
06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
happens if the house or the Senate don't
 
06:02:07.628 --> 06:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
agree with what they did and so if you
 
06:02:10.510 --> 06:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
look on page two starting at line six
 
06:02:13.070 --> 06:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
going all the way through line 30 that
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
was my attempt to create a check and
 
06:02:17.788 --> 06:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
balance against the committee um however
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
I I you might have gotten an email from
 
06:02:20.830 --> 06:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative proud that talked about
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
some constitutional issues and I think
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
he's right um and I think that he that
 
06:02:27.670 --> 06:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
this these sections espe especially
 
06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
starting with number one and going
 
06:02:32.270 --> 06:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
through number five um are not
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate they probably do violate the
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
constitution or at least an
 
06:02:37.628 --> 06:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the Constitution
 
06:02:39.948 --> 06:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
however I think letter C is still an
 
06:02:42.468 --> 06:02:42.478 align:start position:0%
accurate measure and what letter C says
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
is that under um chapter 16 which is how
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
we call a house in the session if if a
 
06:02:49.590 --> 06:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
members wanted to call a house in a
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
session you get 50 uh representatives
 
06:02:53.230 --> 06:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
and eight Senators to sign a petition
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
and submit that um that process could
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
still apply and what this would allow to
 
06:03:01.708 --> 06:03:01.718 align:start position:0%
do is extend it to allow us to have um
 
06:03:04.030 --> 06:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
the same veto Powers as the house on
 
06:03:05.708 --> 06:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
those same executive orders so I do
 
06:03:08.948 --> 06:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
think letter C is appropriate um however
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
numbers one two three four and five are
 
06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
probably unconstitutional I'd be happy
 
06:03:14.750 --> 06:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee to draft an
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to strike those um I I again
 
06:03:20.670 --> 06:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
it was my attempt to try to work um and
 
06:03:22.270 --> 06:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
create a check and balance against the
 
06:03:24.590 --> 06:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee um and I think letter C on its
 
06:03:28.270 --> 06:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
own using chapter 16 does that
 
06:03:30.750 --> 06:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
um again the rest the rest of the bill
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
is relev to process and procedure just
 
06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
talking about emergency executive orders
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
as compared to regular executive orders
 
06:03:37.628 --> 06:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's clear that we're
 
06:03:40.628 --> 06:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
talking about any order issued as a uh
 
06:03:43.230 --> 06:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
as relative to the uh underlying
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
emergency order uh declaration is what
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and I'm happy to
 
06:03:49.230 --> 06:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
take any questions I know there's a
 
06:03:51.868 --> 06:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
whole lot of information really
 
06:03:55.708 --> 06:03:55.718 align:start position:0%
fast thank you uh representative you
 
06:03:58.110 --> 06:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
will take questions to say
 
06:04:01.468 --> 06:04:01.478 align:start position:0%
and go ahead thank you Mr chairman you
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
have the effective date January 1
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
2023 that's two years away how why did
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
you decide on that thing so again the
 
06:04:13.868 --> 06:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
reason was we wanted to make sure we
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
didn't impinge upon it I think that
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
everyone is of the opinion will probably
 
06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
be out of this existing emergency order
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
by that date and I didn't want the run
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
the risk of bumping up against this
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
current executive order uh or state of
 
06:04:28.510 --> 06:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
emergency being in play and and we now
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
have conflicting law we got to deal with
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that so my idea was push it out far
 
06:04:33.868 --> 06:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
enough that by no way shape and form can
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
we impact this state of emergency and
 
06:04:38.190 --> 06:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
the idea is to fix the law going forward
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
as I said this the first time we
 
06:04:41.230 --> 06:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
implement it we kind of have a couple
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned on this situation thank
 
06:04:45.150 --> 06:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
you very
 
06:04:48.670 --> 06:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
much uh any other questions inside
 
06:04:52.110 --> 06:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
committee inside the committee room any
 
06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah representative L uh thank
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
and I really apologize I came in late uh
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm at work um what are the
 
06:05:04.030 --> 06:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
sections you said you think are
 
06:05:06.070 --> 06:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or you would probably
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
delete well so if you look at uh page
 
06:05:11.910 --> 06:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
two of the bill starting
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
at so page two of the bill starting um
 
06:05:23.548 --> 06:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
section uh 3 C line 11 line L all the
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
way down to line 30 I think kind ofes is
 
06:05:30.788 --> 06:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
what chapter 16 says and talks about uh
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
compensation to the legislature which is
 
06:05:34.390 --> 06:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
in this which is in the Constitution and
 
06:05:36.510 --> 06:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
I try to rewrite it here to include that
 
06:05:38.350 --> 06:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
but I think there's a possibility it
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
could be deemed uh unconstitutional so
 
06:05:42.430 --> 06:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
I'd rather strike it and have a nice
 
06:05:44.350 --> 06:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
clean bill and then if we decide we want
 
06:05:45.948 --> 06:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
to approach that I'm happy to look at
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
that next session next term or next
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
session um and see if maybe we can put
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
that check and balance in but I do think
 
06:05:54.270 --> 06:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
it muddies the water and I think it
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:58.868 align:start position:0%
should be
struck

06:05:58.868 --> 06:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
struck
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow sorry thank you I appreciate you
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%

06:06:04.468 --> 06:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
missed that very I came in at the tail

[Music]
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
you I don't see
 
06:06:55.920 --> 06:07:00.910 align:start position:0%

06:07:00.910 --> 06:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
there are any members of the public that
 
06:07:03.670 --> 06:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
would like
 
06:07:07.628 --> 06:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
to shim in um now it's the time to raise
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
know give it
 
06:07:16.510 --> 06:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
a few seconds to see if anybody's
 
06:07:22.230 --> 06:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.240 --> 06:07:23.788 align:start position:0%

06:07:23.788 --> 06:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:27.070 --> 06:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
yes um representative wall thank you m
 
06:07:29.590 --> 06:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
chairman again my only concern with the
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
effective date is technically we're not
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to commit a future legislature
 
06:07:41.708 --> 06:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
to any like this so right that'll come
 
06:07:44.830 --> 06:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
up in in executive session I think
 
06:07:44.840 --> 06:07:46.468 align:start position:0%
up in in executive session I think
[Music]

06:07:46.468 --> 06:07:46.478 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:07:49.590 --> 06:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
um we're getting a nodding of the head
 
06:07:52.788 --> 06:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
from representative le as well so and
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
actually representative Smith's picture
 
06:07:58.190 --> 06:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
is nodding I think
 
06:08:01.510 --> 06:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:05.310 --> 06:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
indeed so with that being said we don't
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
questions who
 
06:08:19.230 --> 06:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
is oh uh yes so Claire representative R
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you know this question
 
06:08:23.070 --> 06:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
probably should have been for the
 
06:08:26.948 --> 06:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor um on page two of the bill um
 
06:08:30.350 --> 06:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
line three uh it states that a majority
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
or a tie vote shall be required to renew
 
06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
the order and I thought I heard Tim say
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
well the the sponsor of the bill say
 
06:08:42.310 --> 06:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
that if it's TI vote then it gets
 
06:08:45.750 --> 06:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
extended um I I am concerned where you
 
06:08:48.788 --> 06:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
have a committee with an equal number
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it would seem to me that you would
 
06:08:53.670 --> 06:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
want to have an unequal number so there
 
06:08:56.948 --> 06:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
is never a situation of a tie vote so
 
06:09:00.670 --> 06:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
either approve it or you don't and um
 
06:09:04.030 --> 06:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
that's all I had is that a question for
 
06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
the sponsor you it would have been it
 
06:09:08.590 --> 06:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
would have been had I got my hand up
 
06:09:08.600 --> 06:09:09.628 align:start position:0%
would have been had I got my hand up
quick

06:09:09.628 --> 06:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
quick
 
06:09:13.590 --> 06:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
enough to answer it still here so you
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
still great great thank you Mr chair
 
06:09:19.030 --> 06:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rard for the uh
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
for the question so um this was a
 
06:09:22.868 --> 06:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
struggle when I was when I was writing
 
06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
this bill about having an even number
 
06:09:26.910 --> 06:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
the idea behind is an equal number of of
 
06:09:28.910 --> 06:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
the majority party and the largest
 
06:09:32.468 --> 06:09:32.478 align:start position:0%
minority party um that the T the the uh
 
06:09:35.230 --> 06:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
membership is broken up to and I guess
 
06:09:37.628 --> 06:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
what I came down to was the idea being
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
that if you were going to override the
 
06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order you better be
 
06:09:43.468 --> 06:09:43.478 align:start position:0%
able to convince at least one member of
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other side that is the right thing
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
to do and if you can't then we should
 
06:09:49.468 --> 06:09:49.478 align:start position:0%
renew the order um that it has to be
 
06:09:51.670 --> 06:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
such an egregious order that people
 
06:09:55.030 --> 06:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
agree even across party lines otherwise
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a it could be used for
 
06:09:59.230 --> 06:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
political purposes is you know if you
 
06:10:02.350 --> 06:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
have a republican majority and a and a
 
06:10:04.350 --> 06:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
Democratic governor the Republican
 
06:10:05.708 --> 06:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
majority just ride all over the
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
Democratic governor and erase every one
 
06:10:10.468 --> 06:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
of the every one of the emergency orders
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
um just out of spite um and so or the
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
inverse and so I was trying to avoid
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
that my way of doing that was to make an
 
06:10:19.708 --> 06:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
equal number and to say that a tie goes
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the governor and um otherwise you
 
06:10:24.628 --> 06:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
have to have a majority vote to veto out
 
06:10:28.510 --> 06:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
an executive order follow up
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely the the then my next question
 
06:10:35.948 --> 06:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
would be um if there is not a majority
 
06:10:39.948 --> 06:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
vote then why would there be a renewal
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be uh a no it is not
 
06:10:45.468 --> 06:10:45.478 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:10:47.628 --> 06:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
renewed yeah I think it's the inverse of
 
06:10:49.230 --> 06:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
the question but yes I could see it I
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
could see it written that way as well I
 
06:10:52.430 --> 06:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
guess my point was if it's anything
 
06:10:54.590 --> 06:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
other than a majority or a tie it's
 
06:10:57.990 --> 06:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to be um veto
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a majority if you vote a majority I
 
06:11:02.430 --> 06:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit ugly worded but
 
06:11:03.708 --> 06:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
um and again I'm happy to bring an
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment in if you can come up with
 
06:11:07.270 --> 06:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
better language or I want me to revisit
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
that and just say on a majority
 
06:11:10.558 --> 06:11:12.628 align:start position:0%
that and just say on a majority
vote

06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
um to veto to Governor's executive order
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you want to word that
 
06:11:19.628 --> 06:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
but I I could look at that it was kind
 
06:11:22.510 --> 06:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
of an ugly phrasing trying to get to it
 
06:11:22.520 --> 06:11:24.350 align:start position:0%
of an ugly phrasing trying to get to it
okay

06:11:24.350 --> 06:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:11:27.390 --> 06:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Le
 
06:11:29.070 --> 06:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and just a comment
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
on that I think the um it really depends
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
on what the question would be how the
 
06:11:35.910 --> 06:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
question would be put to this committee
 
06:11:39.430 --> 06:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
so for example if the question were uh
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know shall the state of Emergen or
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
the emergency order whatever it is uh be
 
06:11:48.910 --> 06:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
ended um then a TI vote would mean it
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
continues because the motion would be
 
06:11:54.468 --> 06:11:54.478 align:start position:0%
defeated by a Tha vote so if I so it
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
really depends on how you want to set it
 
06:11:58.030 --> 06:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
up in terms of what should be brought to
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
this committee that would sort of
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
determine how you want to go with that
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's all it's just a point so again so
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
this doesn't talk about the end of the
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
State of Emergency the end of state of
 
06:12:10.350 --> 06:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
emergency still only has two processes
 
06:12:12.510 --> 06:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
the government the emergency we do the
 
06:12:14.430 --> 06:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
special session and we do a a joint
 
06:12:16.910 --> 06:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
resolution or a concurrent resolution so
 
06:12:18.670 --> 06:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
this is relative only to the emergency
 
06:12:21.548 --> 06:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
orders themselves so the motion would be
 
06:12:23.868 --> 06:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
shall we renew emergency order number
 
06:12:25.830 --> 06:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and the answer is yes or
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
no and depending what the majority is or
 
06:12:30.070 --> 06:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
shall we veto either one doesn't really
 
06:12:31.868 --> 06:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
matter I guess it's the idea is that you
 
06:12:33.350 --> 06:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
have to have at least a majority to
 
06:12:36.430 --> 06:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
renew it or TI vote to renew it um if
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
you have less than that then you
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't R do
 
06:12:43.468 --> 06:12:43.478 align:start position:0%
it that make sense my backwards well
 
06:12:45.350 --> 06:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
again it depending on the motion a TI
 
06:12:48.150 --> 06:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
vote could have different results
 
06:12:50.430 --> 06:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
correct um depends on what the motion is
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay because again a TI vote defeats the
 
06:12:55.910 --> 06:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
motion um so it depends on what the
 
06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
motion is that's all I think we're agre
 
06:13:00.430 --> 06:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
the motion is if the motion is to renew
 
06:13:03.868 --> 06:13:03.878 align:start position:0%
a TI vote defeats the the renewal but if
 
06:13:07.110 --> 06:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
the motion is to end the emergency order
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
then a TI vote allows the order to
 
06:13:13.190 --> 06:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
continue okay I'll be happy again to
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
address that yeah you just may want to
 
06:13:18.030 --> 06:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
clarify on that that's all right sorry I
 
06:13:19.910 --> 06:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
think we're agreed uh there's another
 
06:13:22.590 --> 06:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
hand raised by representative
 
06:13:27.030 --> 06:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
Smith yep thanks um is your
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
looking for the right way to phrase this
 
06:13:31.468 --> 06:13:31.478 align:start position:0%
would would you imagine that if if this
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
passed um there probably need to be uh
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
an accompany an
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
accompanying um change to the house
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
rules to to lay out some of the
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
procedure for this um or or would you
 
06:13:50.190 --> 06:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
expect the the statute to kind of stand
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
alone so I'm not sure we would need
 
06:13:56.590 --> 06:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
rules uh again you know the idea behind
 
06:13:58.990 --> 06:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
is if the governor is not going to if
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
he's going to let the executive order
 
06:14:02.788 --> 06:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
die then he's he's not he's not going to
 
06:14:03.910 --> 06:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
bring it before the committee for a
 
06:14:05.628 --> 06:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
renewal the thing the governor is going
 
06:14:06.990 --> 06:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
to be bringing for the committee is a
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
renewal you know I want to renew
 
06:14:11.868 --> 06:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
executive order number two um I mean
 
06:14:14.750 --> 06:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
emergency executive order number two um
 
06:14:16.110 --> 06:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
and then the vote would be shall we
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
renew it or not um it's not I guess
 
06:14:20.310 --> 06:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's where I get a little bogged down
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that would require
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment amending the rules because
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
we're not ending the state of emergency
 
06:14:26.750 --> 06:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's still in statute that's
 
06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
completely different this is just
 
06:14:29.830 --> 06:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
oversight on the governor's emergency
 
06:14:29.840 --> 06:14:31.150 align:start position:0%
oversight on the governor's emergency
executive

06:14:31.150 --> 06:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
executive
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
orders follow
 
06:14:37.110 --> 06:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
up um not not a question I'm I'm just
 
06:14:38.670 --> 06:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
um the way that I I think when when I
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
see something like this I'm just
 
06:14:45.190 --> 06:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about the what the procedure
 
06:14:46.868 --> 06:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
would look like on the floor in order to
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
get that question in front of the
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee um but I I suppose that's
 
06:14:52.590 --> 06:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
something we can try and figure out
 
06:14:55.468 --> 06:14:55.478 align:start position:0%
later so again if I may again the idea
 
06:14:57.070 --> 06:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
is that it would is a standalone
 
06:14:59.670 --> 06:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee that would be uh would would
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
meet once a state of emergency was
 
06:15:03.868 --> 06:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
enacted once the governor signed and
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
invoked RSA
 
06:15:08.510 --> 06:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
445 um then this committee would be
 
06:15:10.310 --> 06:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
constituted and then once he starts
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
issuing emergency orders any emergency
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
order he wants to renew he has to bring
 
06:15:20.150 --> 06:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
basically do I understand that this
 
06:15:26.190 --> 06:15:26.200 align:start position:0%
committee would be set up at the begin
 
06:15:27.868 --> 06:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
beginning of the legislative session
 
06:15:30.270 --> 06:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for the emergency
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
order be taken correct I'm a big
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
believer to time to plan for emergencies
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
before the emergency so the idea is to
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
establish the committee at the beginning
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
of each term have 10 members assigned
 
06:15:41.270 --> 06:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then if a state of emergency is
 
06:15:42.390 --> 06:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
declared you already know who's
 
06:15:44.190 --> 06:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
06:15:46.230 --> 06:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:56.788 align:start position:0%
 
anywhere

06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
06:16:00.548 --> 06:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
I think we're up another hand represent
 
06:16:03.150 --> 06:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:16:05.830 --> 06:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
for taking the question just and again I
 
06:16:07.868 --> 06:16:07.878 align:start position:0%
think I know the answer to this but the
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
only thing that can come before this
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee would be um the governor
 
06:16:14.830 --> 06:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
requesting to renew or continue an
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
emergency order is that correct that's
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
correct okay so the committee itself
 
06:16:22.350 --> 06:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
followup um the committee itself could
 
06:16:24.670 --> 06:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
not for example say okay we think the
 
06:16:26.510 --> 06:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
order should be renewed the governor
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
disagrees but we're going to override
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
the governor on that I'm sorry can you
 
06:16:31.830 --> 06:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
rephrase that question on not sure I
 
06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
followed you oh sure um if the governor
 
06:16:36.270 --> 06:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to renew an order could the
 
06:16:38.430 --> 06:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
committee override him
 
06:16:40.910 --> 06:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
no about the renewal of the emergency
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
order so the governor would have to

testifying um so we have a uh from for
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
the committee purposes uh in organizing
 
06:17:50.430 --> 06:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh your schedules it looks like Tuesday
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
I've not yet heard back from the chief
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
of staff whether that's Tuesday was to
 
06:17:56.878 --> 06:17:58.030 align:start position:0%
of staff whether that's Tuesday was to
meeting

06:17:58.030 --> 06:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
time uh I
 
06:18:03.830 --> 06:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
agree um and that's why I sent out the
 
06:18:06.830 --> 06:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
message early saying does anybody have a
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
06:18:13.150 --> 06:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
this so um I don't see it in the
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
calendar no it's it's not but that is
 
06:18:20.110 --> 06:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
the day that they gave us um and again
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
we're up against the the March 11th
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
deadline here on the good news um the
 
06:18:30.150 --> 06:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
only thing we have to do on that day
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
is um that one bill that was my
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
oversight from last time that one
 
06:18:40.468 --> 06:18:40.478 align:start position:0%
hearing 186 yeah um which should be
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
quick I mean I don't see does anyone in
 
06:18:44.310 --> 06:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
the committee have a reason to think
 
06:18:49.110 --> 06:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
that that is in a quick um hearing and
 
06:18:52.990 --> 06:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
and vote um it seems to me it would be a
 
06:18:57.030 --> 06:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
a 15 to 20 minute
 
06:18:58.548 --> 06:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
I can't say it's going to be longer than
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
that it's a bill we've already had we've
 
06:19:03.670 --> 06:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
already approved it unanimously I think
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
I think we were fine um that being the
 
06:19:09.788 --> 06:19:09.798 align:start position:0%
case beyond that the only other thing we
 
06:19:14.350 --> 06:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
have is the is the executive sessions on
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
the bills we heard today so um that's
 
06:19:21.628 --> 06:19:21.638 align:start position:0%
what would be in front of us if you need
 
06:19:24.310 --> 06:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
to do it by Zoom that's fine we just
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
need to see the whs of your eyes
 
06:19:30.628 --> 06:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
so um that's the only thing I the only
 
06:19:33.270 --> 06:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
rep that I think had a problem with
 
06:19:37.070 --> 06:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays was Brett Richards um and I'm
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
doing my best to get an answer for her
 
06:19:41.468 --> 06:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
whether it's morning or afternoon I
 
06:19:43.310 --> 06:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a preference the committee
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:19:48.190 --> 06:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
preference yes
 
06:19:50.868 --> 06:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
represent uh probably morning I'm only
 
06:19:53.548 --> 06:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
thinking that um I may have exec also in
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
the education committee at the same day
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know when you know
 
06:20:00.390 --> 06:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
nothing's been scheduled yet so I I
 
06:20:03.190 --> 06:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't know hopefully maybe he can ask
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
chairman lad tomorrow what his thinking
 
06:20:08.910 --> 06:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
is okay um because we have hearings to
 
06:20:12.430 --> 06:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
do there yet too so yeah well I think
 
06:20:15.070 --> 06:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we were given the day that
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
you know it was the choice of Tuesday or
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so but I'm not sure if it's the
 
06:20:23.510 --> 06:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
question of Tuesday morning or Tuesday
 
06:20:25.868 --> 06:20:25.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon I think we just have Tuesday
 
06:20:29.468 --> 06:20:29.478 align:start position:0%
at this point and and we can decide
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves okay so a
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
preference we
 
06:20:38.110 --> 06:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
ac well just that one
 
06:20:40.270 --> 06:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
bill we're hearing that one bill and
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
acting that one bill
 
06:20:48.070 --> 06:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
back what we today yes and then we're
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
done for the 11 oh yeah um I would from
 
06:20:52.920 --> 06:20:54.628 align:start position:0%
done for the 11 oh yeah um I would from
morning

06:20:54.628 --> 06:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
morning
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
earliest morning early do I hear
 
06:20:59.830 --> 06:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that no I I agree I mean I'm in
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester so it doesn't affect me but
 
06:21:07.430 --> 06:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
if anyone's got a town meeting to go to
 
06:21:09.548 --> 06:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
um you know we can probably oblige them
 
06:21:12.750 --> 06:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
if we finish up by midafternoon I don't
 
06:21:18.030 --> 06:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
I it's more voting day than to meeting
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:27.868 --> 06:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:31.910 --> 06:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes um I wish You' see why I wish it was
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
in the morning morning so it sounds like
 
06:21:36.788 --> 06:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
morning is the consensus if that's what
 
06:21:40.190 --> 06:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
we can push for and would that be excuse
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
me Mr chair this is would that be a 9:00
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
am start
 
06:21:47.868 --> 06:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
again um that's Up For Debate as well I
 
06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
don't I don't care that would be my
 
06:21:52.990 --> 06:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
preference as early as possible would be
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah all right that would be
 
06:21:55.320 --> 06:21:58.110 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah all right that would be
fine

06:21:58.110 --> 06:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.868 --> 06:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
I've never known what to do between 9
 
06:22:02.708 --> 06:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
and 10:00 anyway and that's so I'm just
 
06:22:05.708 --> 06:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
as happy to make it nine o'clock
 
06:22:10.788 --> 06:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
this I'm up from 5:30 anyway course so
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so let's for right now unless um I
 
06:22:15.510 --> 06:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
tell you something different um we'll
 
06:22:18.510 --> 06:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
say nine o'clock on Tuesday that's what
 
06:22:21.390 --> 06:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
we go in the calendar it didn't go in
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
last week because because it's a Tuesday
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
we have the requisite four four days if
 
06:22:30.670 --> 06:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
I goose it to this calendar so that's
 
06:22:34.590 --> 06:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
why I was hoping back before in order to
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
get it in on on
 
06:22:40.390 --> 06:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um good then then we'll be
 
06:22:42.868 --> 06:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
wrapped up I have not heard or seen a
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
single bill that will be coming our way
 
06:22:50.548 --> 06:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
for the next half um if that's any
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
consolation that's not to say they won't
 
06:22:55.910 --> 06:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
find something else for us to do but um
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm seeing so
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
far and that's all I have in front of me
 
06:23:04.628 --> 06:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
right now um any other questions anyone
 
06:23:08.948 --> 06:23:08.958 align:start position:0%

06:23:08.958 --> 06:23:09.990 align:start position:0%
