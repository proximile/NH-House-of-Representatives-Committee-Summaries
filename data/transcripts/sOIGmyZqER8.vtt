00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay I I guess we'll get started with
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
our first
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh meeting of the morning
 
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
which is uh related to House Bill 437
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
relative to a reading assessment in
 
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.270 align:start position:0%
relative to a reading assessment in
Intervention

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
Intervention
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
Program um I think pretty much uh the
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
entire subcommittee is here and um a few
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
um uh Spectators as well
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
um uh so I I think where we left off
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
last time um there was a couple of
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
things um that were mentioned at the end
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the last meeting um and one was that
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
we were going to have another conference
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
call with um Dr uh Carol Tolman who is
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the authors of the letters
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
program um and um an
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
international um uh
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
leader in terms of literacy she's been
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
to I found out China and
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
Australia um leading discussions about
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
literacy um so um we did have that
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
conversation and um Melissa white of the
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
department who was here was was part of
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
that call um and I think uh I think it
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
went well um generally supportive of of
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
what's in this document and Dr Coleman
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
um was um glad to see the addition of um
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
the uh assessment for uh teachers um
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
renewing their certification so that um
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
they also get uh up to speed in terms of
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
um uh the evidence-based
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
literacy um direction that um we are
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
headed um and I think we also um I think
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative luno also you mentioned
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
um going through uh this the bill
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
section by section uh pretty much and um
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
so this current handout and I've
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
got um more copies for those in the
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
audience um I've labeled some of the uh
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
areas you know one through I think nine
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
um so we can go through each of those is
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between what you
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
distributed last week
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh just one minor one um the only
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
addition you'll see it uh with an arrow
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
there um uh local school district and
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
chartered public school on um right by
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
the number one on the first page
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
oh um that's pretty much what's what's
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
being done now but um I think the
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to uh specify it in here
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
okay so um the uh first
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
section um is related to the uh um
 
00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.230 align:start position:0%
section um is related to the uh um
Universal

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
screener um and the major change there
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
is that um two that uh this would be a a
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
state supplied uh screener and that it
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be given three times times um a
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
year um which is
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh recommendations from a number of
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
experts and people in the field here in
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um as well um and we had
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
it discussion that um this state
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
screener um could be supplemented um I
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
know a number of teachers who talk to
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists um give more
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
frequent um
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
assessments um based on the individual
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
student and where they are so this is
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
not um one and done type of uh uh
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
requirement um that there just be three
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
assessments um and we've also talked to
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
the department and the feeling is that
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
um there might be funds available for
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
the purchase and training and support of
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
ace Statewide screener for all the
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
districts uh but probably not more than
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
that um so if the uh if we wanted the um
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
Department to provide the screener um
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
you know there would probably be only
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
one um one uh that could be funded um
 
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
and this would probably be from uh
 
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
and this would probably be from uh
federal

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
funds

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
so can I ask it a question
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
we're rolling on this when you say that
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
one could be funded what what does that
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
mean and what does that limitation imply
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that um one universal screener could
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
be funded um probably through federal
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
funds by the department because of the
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
cost they they would probably not have
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
funds available to provide more than one
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh screener for the districts especially
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to um include um the
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
training in the field and support for
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.509 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just mention that a lot of
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
the um areas you'll see um have uh
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
sections included in
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
italics and those are uh specifically uh
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations that uh came from um
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
from the department and from Dr tol in
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
terms of um what we should be um looking
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
at so that's what the uh difference is
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
for the areas in
 
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
for the areas in
italics

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
italics
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um if we go over to page
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
two um you'll see a Roman 3 section I
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
labeled number two um and this um uh
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
requires or this um
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
uh is geared toward uh the um progress
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring and instructional Services uh
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
to be provided um when there is a
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
deficiency um identified in the
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
Universal screener or another uh
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
screener uh locally used um in the
 
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.389 align:start position:0%
screener uh locally used um in the
district

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
um and um that the progress that the
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
student is making should be monitored on
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
a fairly regular basis uh to see if um
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh interventions that are being put in
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
place are actually um having the desired
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
effect um also in this section in um f
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
um we say that the three queing method
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
that is currently being used in a number
 
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
that is currently being used in a number
of

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
districts um should not be re be used
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
and they should be moving toward the
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um reading um and I'll
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
mention here that um this this whole
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
thing really is a follow on to what the
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
department has already been doing over
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years in terms of um
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
I think the program um Melissa correct
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
me if wrong if I'm wrong but is it
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
right um plus the um letters training
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
that is being uh offered um and um last
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
I heard it was over 3,000 people um
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
including teachers parents and even
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
grandparents who are um getting involved
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
with that training in um this
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based science of reading um
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
literacy um uh
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
program which I which um the people from
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
letters u even um mentioned that uh New
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is far ahead of other states
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of um getting people involved
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
in the letters training um especially uh
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
parents and uh others um beyond the uh
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
School staff um we're far ahead of other
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
states in that regard
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
Glen yes sir uh I'm not even sure I'm on
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but I could ask that's
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
okay sure uh where you are on F under uh
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
three uh second page that talks about
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
the uh 3 queing system of reading and
 
00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.549 align:start position:0%
the uh 3 queing system of reading and
visual

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
visual
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
memory I'm I'm uncomfortable with a
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
group of legislators who have no
 
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
background in Reading making decision
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
for people who actually have information
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
about this and I that one I see is a
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
local control local school board
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
decision to make uh so I've been I've
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
been there for a long time I've been
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
really really open about that I'm
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with with us saying to a
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
local school board or system you should
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
do this I'm more uncomfortable with
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
something like this is where says you
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
shall not do this uh I think it's an
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
inappropriate role for this committee to
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
to uh take that particular stand and I
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not cognizant of of uh all
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
the details around the various
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
approaches but just seems as a report as
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
a way of getting at this I I just have
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
problems with the concept that's all I
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh I wouldn't be interested in other
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee commenting on
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
that oh let me mention that um this has
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
been reviewed by
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
um experts around the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
country um and um we would not be the
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
first state to say no more uh three
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
queing um method of instruction of
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
literacy because um it doesn't we've
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
seen that it doesn't work it doesn't
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
work it doesn't reflect um how uh kids
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
learn to read um and um states around
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
the country I think it's something like
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh 18 states in the past few years have
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
moved away from this type of reading
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
instruction to the evidence-based
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
science of reading um method of
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
instruction because it's based on really
 
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.630 align:start position:0%
instruction because it's based on really
research

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
on how um the brain functions in
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
learning how to read
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that um it's important
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
that we uh
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
um uh if you want to say put a stake in
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
the ground and say we have to move to
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
something that evidence has shown will
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
work you know when our state average for
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
um uh Ela proficiency is uh below 50% um
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think we have to go in a different
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
direction and I think here we are moving
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
in a proven um Direction um by experts
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
um here in New Hampshire
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
um as well as around the country have
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
said um you know this is the direction
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
we should go if we want to improve
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
literacy okay thank you so Glenn yes
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
sir so thanks I I I'm not sure that's
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
what what um what art was really getting
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
at here it's not so much a um a a debate
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
or an objection of of of of
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
um you know one you know the the the
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
letters program or evidencebased reading
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
but but but more of the we're now
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
placing the state in a position where
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
we're where we're mandating a certain
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
form of of instruction um uh you know so
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in instruction but but
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
I've I've um you know hung around people
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
that that are and and for example in in
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
mathematics there's a um there's you
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
know you know there's a thing called
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
intuitive math that helps people become
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
better at doing math so should we
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
require intuitive math instruction at at
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
the second grade level to improve our Ma
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
I mean where where does it end I guess
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
is is is is the question I think that's
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
what what what art was was saying here
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
and and that and that we do have um
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
experts um um you know such as Dr
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
cascaden um you know leading the the
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
Berlin School District um um uh you know
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
in hopkington it with Steve Chamberlain
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
when I was on on the school board and
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
then uh of course you've got certified
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
teachers credential teachers that uh
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
that are experts in these areas too and
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the concerns I would
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
have in in in
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
um Part F which I think is what art was
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
looking at so so this is a shall not so
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
what if a what if a teacher
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
does um you know does does that you know
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
what's what's the enforcement mechanism
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
that the department would use to um um
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
to apply right U you know in paragraph
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
that and U yeah thank thank you for that
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
question um yeah there is no um uh
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
penalty or enforcement mechanism in here
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's more of a statement of
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
Direction um there's no um uh date set
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
that as of um you know December 1st U
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
you shall not use um this uh system of
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
of reading um it's a a statement that we
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
want to uh move in this direction and um
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
District should be moving in this
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
direction anyway based on all the
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
efforts of the Department of of
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
education um and this is just putting it
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
into statute that um we need to move
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
away from this this method there is no
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
penalty involved so so thanks for that
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
clarification but in section three um
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom of of paragraph Roman I uh it
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
says the Department of Education shall
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
adopt rules 541a concerning reading
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
interventions which is which is that
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
that exact thing and and those rules
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to include things such as
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
um um as disciplinary actions uh against
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
against teachers wouldn't they um yeah
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure if we have rules that
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
include um uh disciplinary actions um
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
but um those all um I I see someone uh
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative yeah I'm not on
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
the committee either as AR alluded to he
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
may not be on it either
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
but but you know where I'm coming from I
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
I think the the whole idea this this uh
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
methodology for instructing and teaching
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
reading has a place in our
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
schools I I tend to still go back to who
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility for curriculum
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
and instruction we clearly state in
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
statute that that's a local
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
decision um so when we when we say that
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
you shall not do
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
something it's like when we had this hot
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
debate years ago when it came to Modern
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
math or common core math there are
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
really Divergent groups on on on both
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
the sides of the coin and um it to say
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
this is how we're going to Mary is
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
reading along and all of a sudden doing
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
a great job all a sudden bang she
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand the word there so
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
then the teacher then tries to identify
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
and offer some uh instructional skills
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
or ideas of how that what that word may
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
be um I I think that is a decision that
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
has has to be made based upon the
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
instruction they've learned in the prep
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
schools and all that you know
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
Preparatory colleges on on uh how to
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
teach reading as we're staying within
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
saying in this bill that's good but
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other ways too and I
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
saw too many times in the past where
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
we've been told no classrooms going to
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
have no walls no they're going to have
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
walls no we're going to teach inquiry
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
oriented science with skiss and ESS and
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
all the other programs that came out at
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
that time and then we're going to go
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
into modern math and then we realize oh
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
the kids can't identify a difference
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
between a number and a numeral we're
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to go into Common Core MTH and the
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
pendulum swings so much in
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
education that um sometimes we we let it
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
get out of control and we end up our
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
teachers end up becoming managers not
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
instructors and so I I I app applaud the
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
bill I think we need to go that
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
direction however I don't think we
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
should say no to any particular way of
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
teaching um so that's where where I'm
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
coming from I I think there is a measure
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
of local control and responsibility for
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
that that lies with the specific
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
district and with that classroom teacher
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
classroom um Melissa would you like to
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
come up and talk
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
about the uh direction of the department
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
regard oh right you repeat
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
yes um yeah shall not uh employ the
 
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
yes um yeah shall not uh employ the
three

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
Q queing from the way I read that I can
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
turn that on if that helps from the way
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
that I read this is in regards to the
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
students that do not pass is that
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
correct the screening so we're talking
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
at the most at risk students the
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
students who are flagged as needing the
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
most Intervention which would normally
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
mean that we would want to give them a
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
intervention that is reliable and proven
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
to work with students um so when we look
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
at that we're looking at longitudinal
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
data that shows that it has worked in
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
variety of school settings to make sure
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the students can improve and Excel
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
in learning how to read so the way in
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
which I'm read I don't read it that it's
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
removing it from all schools but
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
removing it from the students who were
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
flagged most at
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
risk which is a different type of of
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
level we're talking about kids who are
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
not breaking the code in reading and
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
phenology spelling does that help answer
 
00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:47.389 align:start position:0%
phenology spelling does that help answer
the

00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
lak even the person who first came up
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the 3 queing system has
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
more recently said it doesn't work
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be doing it and there's
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
evidence that if you're trying to te do
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
both 3 queing and other methods the 3
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
queing is even harmful in conjunction it
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
not only doesn't work it interferes with
 
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.149 align:start position:0%
not only doesn't work it interferes with
actually

00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
learning and that doing both should not
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
be an option because doing both is still
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
harmful that's right and I think you're
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
refering resarch says yes is um uh
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
Columbia University um School of uh um
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation um has uh um
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
terminated the uh division that uh used
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
or was based on the Lucy cins method of
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh instruction which is um basically the
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
three queing
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
method so and and as was pointed out um
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
um section three which is where this is
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
the intervention where there has been a
 
00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:09.870 align:start position:0%
the intervention where there has been a
deficiency

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
identified uh many
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes so you know and I I I I I apologize
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
for always leaning on my time on the
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
school board but and I can see Becky
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
sort of you know laugh on on that a
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
little bit because um she we worked
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
together at Hopkinson when I was on the
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
board um but um but you know I'm I'm I'm
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with the term you know um you
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
know response to intervention RTI and
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
intervention um
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh and and I I I seem to recall a lot of
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
professional development being directed
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
towards uh towards this area um for um
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
for you know for teachers and I guess we
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know we've got we've got credential
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
teachers in in all of our
 
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.029 align:start position:0%
teachers in in all of our
schools

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
um that would know I think about about
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
the the differences and the interactions
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
between the queuing system and and um
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
and a a and I'm I'm missing the term not
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
phonics but uh but a um awareness what
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
is it phic awareness phic awareness type
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh type system but are are we you know
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
is the concern that that that we don't
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
have trained Professionals in our
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
classrooms that need to have statute
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
direct how they provide instruction
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
or I I mean I guess is that the concern
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't have trained teachers in
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
in classroom so we need to have statute
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
that directs instruction uh I I think
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
that there are many um uh teachers and
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists who are trained in
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
the new um evidence-based science of
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
reading um based on letters and based on
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
actually um uh newly certified or uh
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
licensed teachers um take an assessment
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
called knowledge of reading um which is
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
based on this new method of reading um
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why in here we also add for
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
teachers renewing they should have that
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
assessment um under their belts also um
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
so that we know that they are um all
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
moving in the in this Direction that's
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
the the idea is in this is to move in
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
that direction because we need to do
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
something to improve our literacy so
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
aren't you just saying that we're
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
already moving in that
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
direction uh I think that's the
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
Department's uh Direction
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes and and our and our districts are
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction some not all is
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding from from talking to
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.909 align:start position:0%
 
field

00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
field
okay

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
um well I'll leave it at that I don't
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
want to get into the the money angle of
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
things um but do you have any further uh
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
comments on that no I think that's about
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
right the districts are all over the map
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
some of them are switching some of them
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
are still in um different program we did
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
conduct a survey that showed that a
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
variety were using um fondon panel and
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
Lucy ckins and so I know that there's
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
been a shift and we did offer the
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
Leaning into literacy Grant um and
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
provided schools with resources and
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
apply thank you um
 
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.590 align:start position:0%
apply thank you um
uh

00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
anticipate what happens going forward if
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
if this legislation were to
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
pass and I think we probably can all
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
agree that education is ongoing and how
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
children learn whether it's learning to
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
read or learning math or whatever what
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
we think today is different than what we
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
thought at various different times in
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
the past and the programs for different
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
curriculums keep changing so if we were
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
to put this in place and then we learn
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
differently about
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
reading we are saying to districts you
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
can't change until we legislate another
 
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.109 align:start position:0%
can't change until we legislate another
state

00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
imposed approach to teaching
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
reading as opposed to respecting that
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
license trained education professionals
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
care so much about kids that they will
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
continue to evolve and Implement what is
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
the current understanding of how
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
children learn it's not
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
static so the question part of that is
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
what what would a district do if this
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
were in place and it no longer made
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
sense in the knowledge of the
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
day well what we're talking about here
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
with evidence-based science of reading
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
is based on decades Decades of
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
research um it's not something that has
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
popped up in the past uh two or three
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
years um um there's been brain studies
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
done as looking at sections of the brain
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
and how children actually um comprehend
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
and uh develop comprehension and
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
identification of um the words that
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
their reading um so this is not um
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
something that's uh just sprung up this
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
is Decades of research that um has not
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
been um
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
really pushed forward until the past um
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh you five 10 years maybe
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
um for various factors one is because of
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
the publishing industry
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
um um so I I think that we're not we're
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
doing something here that is based
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
solidly on evidence and um scientific
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
evidence um in terms of brain research
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
um so um will there be more research
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
done um in the future uh probably um but
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
also one of the um things in this Bill
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
also is that the uh department is to
 
00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
also is that the uh department is to
provide

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
guidance to um local districts in terms
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
of instructional materials that um uh
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
should be used so we're we're trying to
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
leverage um Everybody into this process
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
um from the Department to the districts
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the parents to the communities to
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
libraries um we need U everyone to try
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um move forward in terms of
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
improving literacy um in this state and
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's being done around the country
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know we're not uh we're not
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
leading the pack on this um uh um you
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
know maybe we should have been but um
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is uh move it
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
research follow
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.470 align:start position:0%
research follow
up

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.150 align:start position:0%
up
thank

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm trying
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
language there are Decades of research
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
in I think any aspect of brain function
 
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.470 align:start position:0%
in I think any aspect of brain function
and

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
Science and we keep
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
learning and when we learn if I fall
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
back to my roots in dietetics nutrition
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
work people would complain you keep
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
changing your mind eggs are good eggs
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
are bad eggs are good which is it it's
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
not changing your mind it's learning and
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
responding to the
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
new ongoing studies and reflecting that
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
in the recommendations that are
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
made so I'm uncomfortable with
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
saying this may I don't know I'm not a
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
reading expert this may well be the best
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
way to teach reading
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
today but putting it into law means
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
we're saying it's the best way to teach
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
reading in perpetuity and that doesn't
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to me fite your thoughtful
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
explanation um I would just comment that
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
we're not mandating any
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum um and even the department is
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
huh I'm sorry I didn't mean to blur out
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
but I said yes we are because it looks
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
to me like we're mandating a curriculum
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
what what is this if it isn't a
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum it's a method of instruction
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
um we had disc with the Department about
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh curriculums and um instructional
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
materials and we decided the best course
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
of action was for the Department just to
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
recommend instructional materials not
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
mandate some states actually have a list
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
of curriculum that is allowed to be
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
taught in um in schools in their state
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
um and we're not we didn't want to head
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
in that direction because of local
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
control we just want a curriculum um
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
instruction materials that are based on
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
this new um or decades old research that
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
has been done um that's that's only
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
where we're going it's not mandating any
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
specific curriculum we purposely um
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
avoided going down that
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
path representative
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
lakas yeah I just wanted to respond to
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
about what rep luno said and and in the
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
more recent conversation
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um yes teachers are certified and
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
trained the problem is what they were
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
certified and trained in because 3
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
queing was big for a long time and there
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
are a lot of teachers that's what they
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
were taught and that's what they're
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
teaching and as the doe
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
found some schools are still using it in
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that it's been shown
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't work and in spite of the
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
fact that even the person who developed
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
it said it doesn't work and she has kind
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
of recanted what she was doing because
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
she realizes it doesn't work we have
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
lots of evidence now years's worth that
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work so that's why we're
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
saying not to use it but yes there are
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
still school districts that are using it
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're saying you can't
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
but the other
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
part it says evidenced based reading
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
instructional program it doesn't that
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
the evidence changes that will change
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
not use this book use this curriculum
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it's
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
use use a curriculum that's based on
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
science and evidence so if the evidence
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
changes that should change as well we're
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
not specifying what to give it that
 
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to say as we learn more we
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
will change what we're doing
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
and as we learn more well what have we
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
learned we learn three queing doesn't
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
work so we're saying we're not going to
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
do that we're saying we're going to use
 
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.470 align:start position:0%
do that we're saying we're going to use
evidence-based

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
materials well that will change as
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific repres I'd like to ask Melissa
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
you're sitting there listening to all
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
this I do have a question for you that
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
uh from your perspective of working at
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
doe and interacting with school
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
districts um in the amendment that I'm
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
looking at it's a little different but I
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
think it's the same language and
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
everything that you're talking about
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
here upon doing the screening in grades
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
K through three or grades 1 through
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
three kindergarten grades 1 through
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
three and if a child is identified as
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
needing support in
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
reading the it says shall be given
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
intensive and I need to know what
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
intensive means means and general
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
education reading intervention I need to
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
know what general education means in
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
terms of does it mean at the local level
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have a remedial
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
reading teacher get involved are you
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to have the classroom teacher now
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
having another group are you going to
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
break kids up into high middle low like
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes we do in
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
mathematics um and that intervention
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
must start within 10 days uh so there
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
there's three things there which I'm
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
really concerned about I need to have
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
what you mean by
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
intensive who intensive you know might
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
be different in District a and certainly
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
different in
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
C um but we're mandating that this
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
occur yeah so what we're thinking is
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
what we would call mtss or the three
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
tier system so once a student is
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
identified they will get additional
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
support in reading and you're correct it
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
will look very different depending on
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
the school systems some school systems
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
have pair of professionals who are
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
trained to do that some school districts
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
have Title One teachers which is a
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
federal program some school districts
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
use their reading teachers depending on
 
00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
um the way that the test results come
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
out so once the test results come out
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
schools should have data meetings to
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
discuss what levers do we have inside
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
the school to provide that support for
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
that child and it can look very
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
different but the idea is that the top
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
gets um so when you asked about General
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
ad that's the teacher in the classroom
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
so the top gets the teacher and then
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
they get an additional layer and you
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
could have groups um that has been done
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
where a kid will rotate to different
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
teachers um inside the classroom to get
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
different levels of support but you want
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
to use the data to guide the support
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
right if the students don't know their
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
letters and sounds that's where you want
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
to start a group that targets that skill
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
if the students don't have phic
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
awareness you start a group for that if
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
the students need help and comprehension
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
you start a group with that way so
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
you're meeting the needs of the students
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
in front of you um tier two can even
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
occur inside the general classroom
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
depending on how that classroom is set
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
up so a teacher could take a group right
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
and give them extra help inside their
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
classroom as well so you're right
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's a varied landscape across um New
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Educators and it really
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
depends on how the schools um can use
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
those levers inside their school and may
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
I follow up sure and and does it depend
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
Melissa upon of course there are a lot
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
of variables you know we have rural
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
schools very small we have City Schools
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
which are very large and may have some
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
support internally in their curriculum
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
departments um are we talking yes
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
there's Grant programs but we've seen
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
grants are here today and gone tomorrow
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then when we hire folks to uh teach
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
these areas and the grant disappears
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
then you have this uproar internally
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
within the district oh you're going to
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to lose Mrs Smith here who's
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
excellent teacher but there's no no
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue coming in to support
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
that salary so then you either looking
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
at local property taxes going up um my
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
concern is I guess a number of issues
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
right here that you know the the
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers I know are very
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
effective in to a degree that are some
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
students as we see even in special
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
education where the kid needs to be
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
pulled because there is a specific IEP
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
need we're going to start seeing that
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be some costs
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
associated with that and the small
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
District certainly is not going to have
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
a small school of 70 kids in it k
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
through eight may not have that support
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
system internally within the school so
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
how do they how are they going to be
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
able to uh comply with this all
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislation um where you're going to
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
have to get this reading intervention
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
and it's going to have to be intensive
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
well I don't think that that's any
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
different than the recent legislation
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
law that you guys just passed for the
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
dyslexia screener because technically if
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
the students are flagged in the dyslexia
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
screener the school must provide um
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
intervention that is
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so it actually does not
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
change um that in any shape or form
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
because the current dyslexia screener
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
says You must provide that EV
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based instruction so our
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
schools are already working on plans to
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
support kids who are struggling reading
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'm getting lots of calls on that
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of different ideas
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
that they've come up with but they are
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
really trying to support the students um
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
flagged I don't doubt that they're
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
trying to support I I know they're
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do that that I I I guess my
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions go to you know where's the
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
wherewithal coming to do that and what
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
kind of organizational changes are they
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
having to do with their staff internally
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that this occurs with that
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
class of 20 kids now you have maybe five
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
kids or three kids that need this
 
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.470 align:start position:0%
kids or three kids that need this
intervention

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
um there's only so many hours in a day
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
and there's only that much of a teacher
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
that can be split apart and so um that
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
that's a concern okay if if I could just
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
um read from 377 which we passed last
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
year the student School District shall
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
provide age appropriate evidence-based
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
intervention strategies to begin by
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
January 1st of the school year for any
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
student who is identified as having
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
characteristics that are associated with
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
potential indicators or risk factors of
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
Dyslexia and Related Disorders so that's
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's in statute now as as you point
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
out it doesn't say
 
00:48:56.589 --> 00:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
intensive strategy so this says intens
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
ensive and that that's a word that I I
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
dream so Glenn yes I'm glad you brought
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
up um um uh House Bill 377 that was
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
passed earlier this year uh it it
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
literally just went into effect four
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
weeks ago so I don't think we've got any
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
data coming com from this and and makes
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
sense to me at least that that we should
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
we should see how how
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
377 um you know takes off you know over
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the next you know 12 24 months and um
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
and and we should see some some positive
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
you know you know fruits from that fruit
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
from that work that uh that this
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee uh did recently on that but um
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
my my my question to you though really
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
sort of I think you know tails off what
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
what Rick was um was asking and
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
something you mentioned ear earlier that
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
um that did you say that the department
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
has a grant right now um to help
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
districts um we better trained and we
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
did have a grant they are looking at
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to reinstate that
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
um we used essr funds to um provide 25 I
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
believe maybe even 35 schools um funding
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
for materials it was
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
um you had to submit we had there was a
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
whole rubric involved and so they are
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether that might be another
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity again in the future to
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
continue to provide um some materials
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
for school systems so so um do you
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
recall how much um in the aggregate that
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
that S Grant was and and did you say it
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
was for 35 districts received I can tell
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
you right away as I'm writing a report
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
no that'd be great is there another
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
question in the meantime well well yeah
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
I mean so the the um the the the
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
question I'd be getting to is is um is
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know are would we be better off um
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
using this bill as a vehicle to um to
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
help continue that Grant and rather than
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
it being a competitive Grant be a grant
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
that's really directed to the schools
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
that we now know um uh are um maybe need
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
additional support to to to move off um
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know a queuing method towards
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
towards new methods um that was the
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
direction my original bill was headed um
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
but I felt that after the bill did not
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
get passed last year when we had the
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
budget available to us to try and
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
Implement um um a grant related to um
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
children with uh
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
deficiencies based on children number of
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
children deficiencies and a plan for
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
addressing those facilities I thought it
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
might be uh too much of a cost to try
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
and put forward in a non-budget year so
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we decided to go with the
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
compe competitive Grant scenario but um
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
we put in a time frame for that t uh
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant so that in the next
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
budget we could revisit that and my hope
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
is that we could move to a um a larger
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
Grant process um uh um that I had in the
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
original bill so that's why um this was
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
the competitive Grant was an interim
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
step to getting hopefully to something
 
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.470 align:start position:0%
step to getting hopefully to something
more

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive the competitive Grant had
 
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.230 align:start position:0%
comprehensive the competitive Grant had
a

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation in here of I think 1 a.
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
half million uh for 24 and 2 and a. half
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
million for 25 something along those
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
lines where um the original grant
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
program would have been considerably
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
so what what was the what did the Esser
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
like

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
so so it it would would be in the
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
ballpark of about a a million doll type
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
type Grant not A10 million type
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
well 51 schools are 51
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
districts and when when we when we do
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
grants at the school level uh I forget
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
how many schools Manchester
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
has 40
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
some

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay okay
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
um well I I mean I I I guess I'm I I
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
would put it out there for consideration
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not this it would be an
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to use this bill as a
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh even in an off-budget year to
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
to extend a a to replace the the Esser
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
Grant which I which has completed
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
correct um with a with with state grants
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
in with a state Grant in in that sort of
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know $1 to2 million
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh thing this could go to finance and uh
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
and then go to um joint fiscal for uh
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know final appropriation if you want
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
to take a look at um the bottom of page
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
four um Roman five y um is the
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated amount um for the next
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
couple of fiscal years um and the um
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant would be up to
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
$75,000 per
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
school5 million in the aggregate yeah
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you know if we wanted to bump
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
up that total I have no problem with
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
that um but um you know with the
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
original Bill scenario we were thinking
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
more in the um uh $10 million and up in
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the cost per
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
year would it be would it be more
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
effective for for the Department to be
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
able to direct the grant where it's
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
where where you've done data collection
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
and and know that schools are not doing
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
it or would it be better to do this as a
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant I'm not sure it really
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
matters it would be about how they would
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
fill out the grant so you would rate it
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
right they would have we would look at
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
criteria whether it was evidence-based
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
so that's what we did in the literacy
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
Grant they had to State how they found
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
that it was evidence-based which is on
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
various websites um that rate programs
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
what works Clearing House evidence for
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
Essa they also had to write how they
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
were going to help their staff um get
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
trained in how to use use the program
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
right so that that was the second piece
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then what was their data to show why
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
they chose that PR program right looking
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
at that data again so it really would
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
depend yeah yeah no I I I appreciate
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
that I also appreciate the fact that
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
that that you know filling out Grant
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
applications requires a that's a
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
commitment in and of itself it too so so
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than putting up
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
barriers for schools to receive the um
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
the the development funds that they
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
would need to to um uh to train their
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
their professional faculty in this this
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
direction maybe that it's something that
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
the department could uh could could
 
00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:46.670 align:start position:0%
the department could uh could could
direct

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
um if I could I I just mention in that
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
regard I I wouldn't want us to see us
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
get into a
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
scenario um which we had with the
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for um third grade
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
reading where we just gave out a flat
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
amount of money for each student who was
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
um below proficiency um in that regard
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
with uh with no accountability or or
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
Direction um coming from the district on
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
how those funds um would be used or were
 
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.710 align:start position:0%
how those funds um would be used or were
being

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%
 
used

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
about $75,000 can I ask meliss question
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
U Melissa the other day I believe you
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
were there with the
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
provos okay okay well when I when I was
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
meeting after the trustee meeting I
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
think it was last week on on Friday
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
afternoon the commissioner was there oh
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
yes meeting with the Provost of Keane
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
and uh Plymouth and
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
UNH um they indicated that they in their
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
Departments of Education are moving
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
forward forward with instruction in this
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
area of literacy for all their new
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
teachers coming out of those
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
institutions so I'm I'm reassured that
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
that you we have some cooperation from
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
our postsecondary institutions in the
 
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.549 align:start position:0%
our postsecondary institutions in the
state

00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
here um however you know I'm I'm I just
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
and and where I'm concerned is uh
 
00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:19.039 align:start position:0%
several of Words which you know really
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh to me are kind of you
 
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh to me are kind of you
know

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
ambiguous but I I I'm concerned that the
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
the program that we have here is another
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
one of those Grant programs like we saw
 
00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
with a math learning communities where
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
we had 36 high schools very involved
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
starting to show great growth and then
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
Finance stopped the funding of that
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
program and the Community College had to
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
pull out um and and uh that hurt in the
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
high school level that was a very
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
similar type program where we saw real
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in math understandings and
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
skilled knowledge um so um if we don't
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
have really concurrence here in terms of
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to make this a long-term effort
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have another statute on
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
the books which is not going to be
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
funded and with that it's going to be
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult for districts to comply
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
with some of the terminology we have
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
within here that they can go ahead and
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
be using this as a method of instruction
 
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
but when we were use words like in
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
intensive and and the general education
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
I take that to be exactly what you said
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
that's the classroom teacher MH and
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to be just another ask of
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
the classroom teacher which they should
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
be doing this they should be working
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
with remedial kids and and but they they
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
may have other methodologies going on
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
and and then it comes Arts local control
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
issue on curriculum and instruction so I
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
think there are some issues here which
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
we have to uh recognize I do support I
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
do support what we're doing here uh but
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be some red
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
flag to go up as we go along the path
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
here to get this thing in place and
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
working I don't know how to address
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
work and yeah Melissa white would have
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
to speak on the financing part of it um
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
because I oversee the professional
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
development the reach out to the schools
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
and the support and that front Melissa
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
would control the finances do you have
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
any more uh title 2 monies that have not
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
been used I believe so I work closely
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
with the title 2 department but I again
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
I don't have the finance I know that
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
they've been supporting training um and
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
they brought in the Brett Conway um data
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
driven decision-making three-day
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
conference but again I don't see the
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
finance side of of the department I'm
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
more of the boots on the ground
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
supporting the teachers
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
okay if if the subcommittee feels that
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
um the 1.5 million in the next two years
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
um should be bumped up and let Finance
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at it you know I have no
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
problem in submitting um the amendment
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
with uh increased dollar numbers
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
there um so I so Glenn I I was only
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting that in um you know by
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
essentially replacing the bill to to
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
provide an ex uh uh uh you know
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
financing extension to the to the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
Department's grant program I you know I
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
would I would take out I I would really
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
take out everything else and um and and
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
let House Bill
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
377 have some time on the on the
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
screening side and and you know extend
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
some support through the department to
 
01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
schools that um that you know need the
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
um need additional you know uh training
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
in professional development in this area
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
that that's all I was suggesting thank
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.109 align:start position:0%
that that's all I was suggesting thank
you

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
um maybe in time we have remaining
 
01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:04.510 align:start position:0%
um maybe in time we have remaining
touch

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
what let 377 do its work since it just
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
went into effect this is the dyslexia
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
screening just when to affect the indic
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
P um and use this as a vehicle as a
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
potential vehicle to to um to support
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
in its in its um in a in a grant
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
program to support professional
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
development in this area and take out
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
all the prescriptive um stuff that that
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know that I think probably does need
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and sort of reads against you know other
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
places in statute like you know 193e
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
that says local districts are
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
instruction I I think we would be
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
missing a huge opportunity um half of
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
our students are not proficient in
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
reading and just to prolong that um
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
penalty or that uh chain on our students
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of learning how to read I think
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
would be a huge huge mistake um 377
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
um was targeted to dyslexia and Related
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
Disorders this is targeted to a much
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
broader uh audience of students
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
um um and
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
addresses um the uh teacher prep
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
programs we do take a look and require
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
an addition uh a report each year from
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
the Department as to what's going on in
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
those teacher prep programs because um
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know we've seen it from studies
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
that National studies that have been
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
done with three of our universities
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
getting D or Fs in terms of their move
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
in this direction and I've heard it from
 
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
um a reading specialist whose daughter
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
um is attending one of those colleges
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to teach
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
both the evidence-based science of
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
reading and the three queing method and
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
um her daughter is just confused about
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
what what's going on um so we we address
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
that um we try and make sure that
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
there's more parental involvement
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
Community involvement U parental
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
involvement is key um in um making this
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
work I think so to just um have a bill
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
um related to funding and to delay um
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
the rest of it I think would be a huge
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
part um let me just touch on a few few
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
more things um I just mentioned a couple
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the uh annual reports
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
based on um uh the teacher prep programs
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
and Survey of the those programs um I've
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
talked with uh uh Dr applebe about that
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
um and they're um uh on board with that
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
um annual reports from um the department
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
as to progress of coming back to um our
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh committees in the house and the
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
Senate um is all included in this um as
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
well as um what I mentioned in terms of
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
the certification renewal process um and
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that those teachers um had
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
been through uh the knowledge of reading
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
assessment so that they are up to speed
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
and uh on the last page that requirement
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
is only in place for certain teachers
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
and not everybody would have to go
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
through this assessment um and it was
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me that um even with the
 
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.029 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me that um even with the
initial

01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
initial
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
certification um I don't think that
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
special education teachers um go through
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of reading assessment um
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we include that in here um because I
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
think that's uh very important because
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
um as part of this um if after a certain
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
period of time uh the deficiencies
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
um are not being um uh there is no
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
improvement let's say um there would be
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
a call for referral to special education
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
so special education teachers also have
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
believe

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so any you know we're a few minutes
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
past our time encroaching on the next uh
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and subcommittee but are there
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
any further um comments I'm sure we'll
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
have uh uh I I will be putting this in
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
for drafting um so if there's anything
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
else please let me know but um you know
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
we will I'm sure we'll have a further
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on the 13th about
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
it yes I would love it thank you I was
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
just waiting for you to be
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
done um you know I mean I've been in the
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
field long enough I'm licensed as a k
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
to8 Elementary ed teacher I've taught
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
reading um to keep up those reading
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
skills over the last 40 years just
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
because you need to um I'm also licensed
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
as an English for speakers of other
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
languages and have to teach them L you
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
know L uh language skills and reading as
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
well um and testing them and been
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
through this evidence-based reading um
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
quite a long time
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
ago and um it seems like historically
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
every time there's um a nape score or a
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
state score that comes out it creates a
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
rise in people like nobody's been doing
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
anything and now we need to put the fire
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
out and nap scores are only for those
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
participating districts right it's not
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
everybody it's only grades four through
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
eight and traditionally we don't do as
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
well in the nape scores a better valid
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and reliable measure is our state
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
assessment which measures reading and um
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
and math and that's what from my
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
experience school teams will use to look
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
for um instructional areas of weakness
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
that they need to beef up on and
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
specifically which kids need something
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
different so it's not new and of course
 
01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:45.070 align:start position:0%
different so it's not new and of course
after

01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
coid kids were responsible to learn
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
their basic reading skills at
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
home and unless they've got somebody
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
there to teach them they're going to
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
come back to school and be a year or two
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
behind which obviously has happened I'm
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that within five years maybe
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
sooner that will balance out again so we
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
get back on a
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
Continuum um but we have to think of
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
that part we also have to think about if
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
kids come to kindergarten without all
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
their pre pre-reading skills or language
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
development which many in poverty don't
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
have those skills they can swear at you
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
they know how to manage
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
money but you know what they might not
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
be able to tell the difference between
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
Bic sounds or not um so we have to think
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a big piece on reading
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
success so then when they get to
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
kindergarten you get the gamut and the
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
range of academic abilities on where
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
kids are in reading and so that's when
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
the three- tier model of instruction
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
became more formalized I mean when I
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
started out at College we were doing uh
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
ability grouping and leveled reading
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
groups right and then we called it uh
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
response to intervention which was more
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
defined um you know and it's been a some
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
districts then over time called it the
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support so that
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
you do Universal instruction all kids
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
get the same instruction and then
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
through assessments screenings then you
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
start divvying out who's mastered that
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
and who has not um and then you have a
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
second tier of intervention it might be
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
a small group within the classroom or it
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
might be a title one tutor or it might
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
be a reading specialist and if the
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
students who are screened after those
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
skills are presented again then they may
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
have to go in a the a tier three which
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
is an individual instruction which might
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
require them to have a totally different
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
approach to reading uh Wilson
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
foundations reading recovery slingerland
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
was you had to write in the air cuz kids
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
didn't hear sounds you talk about 3
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
queing I honestly until I came to this
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee had never heard that term but
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
in learning what it is it has to be a
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox if you have a
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
student with frequent ear infections who
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
can not hear sounds and can't put those
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
blend those sounds together they must
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
learn through site so you have to have
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it it's there's no one
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
method that's going to work for every
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
student but somehow you have to teach
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
them those five components in whatever
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
way or learning style they have so
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
teachers have to be very um they have to
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a toolbox they have to have a
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
variety of materials there's no one
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
basil program's going to work for all
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
kids but you have to start with
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
something for all kids um I I was glad
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
to hear the child study team or the data
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
data flowchart so we've been abiding by
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
this and the child study team questions
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
on when to progress from tier one to
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
tier two to tier three it's pretty
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
scripted and then um the flowchart for
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
it really is dated 2006 and comes out of
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
the Rochester school district I mean the
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
stuff is just not
 
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.110 align:start position:0%
stuff is just not
new

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I wonder is um so
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of components to get kids
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
to learn how to read and you can't kids
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
are not clones they aren't all going to
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
hit that proficiency Mark at the same
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
time and unfortunately some kids can
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
only learn up to fourth grade level some
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
kids can only read up to sixth grade
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
level or eighth grade level but you have
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
to give them your best
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
shot um
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
I think that this reminds me of what's
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
in a local curriculum guide for teachers
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
to follow step by step within a district
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a method of
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
instruction you want a certain
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum to meet that instruction and
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
that's local control unless we are all
 
01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:13.790 align:start position:0%
that's local control unless we are all
reading

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
Specialists I don't think we should be
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
handing this down to the teachers fact
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
if I was a teacher I'd say this is
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
pretty insulting how dare they I've been
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
using a screening for 10 years
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
um we progress monitor one of those
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
tools that was used widely in New
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was nwaa and then they came
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
out with uh progress monitoring progress
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring is a very common
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
term amongst Elementary School
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
teachers um the other piece on part
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
five um on page three where there's
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
mention of um the special ed process
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
process I would caution about that
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
because every single district is
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
required to have a procedures and
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
process manual for children with
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities and it's mered from the
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
state so within those manuals
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
locally there is process and procedure
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
on what has to be followed and it comes
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
down there are specific questions that
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to be asked you know I mean I was
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
talking to a parent yesterday I saidwell
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
kids needs are not being met well how
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
are they not being
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
met well they're not identifying kids
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
the way we want them to be well there
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
has to be a discrepancy between the
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
achievement testing and the cognitive
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
testing and if those are within a
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
certain point span then it creates the
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
potential for a disability and then the
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
team has to decide does the child need a
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
different program as a result of that or
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
can their needs be met and so it's very
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
very prescriptive and the teachers are
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
very trust me they go to lots of Ip and
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
special ed meetings um and they're very
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
well vered in
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
it um so handing this
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
down you really I mean I feel it insults
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
the teachers I
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
mean it's they know what they're doing
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
they do it every single day we're not
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
doing it every day and we're not meeting
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
with kids every day but teachers
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
are um and I
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
guess I'd want to know I mean I know
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the North Country
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
schools but what's going on in your
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
district schools representative do you
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
know what Effingham and Crescent Park
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
and do you know what those schools are
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
doing Carpenter schools do you know what
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
they're doing for reading no no um
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
because I think especially in the wilbo
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
area my my colleagues there um have
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
always had the financial resources to be
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
able to stay up with the most Uh current
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
training and whatnot and really my
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
experience with the Department of Ed
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
they've always had strong people in the
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
field that have been very helpful and
 
01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:21.870 align:start position:0%
field that have been very helpful and
resourceful

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
resourceful
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
um but we're talking about something
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's been out there for a long time um
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that you need to trust the
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
system and my other problem with this
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned this the last time as a
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislative body we should be concerned
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
about all kids learning to read and this
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
does not address all
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
kids and who's going to submit yet
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
another report to the Department of Ed
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really makes sense nobody's
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
got time to submit their beginning
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
middle and end of year data it's already
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
in their software so somebody wants it
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
here it
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
is um so you don't want to add more jobs
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
to the district it's really it's really
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
government overreach in my opinion um
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
because there are so many factors that
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
go into teaching kids to
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
read um so I I would definitely like to
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
see the department
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
continuing to provide those trainings I
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
mean as I said before I was trained in
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
letters uh 10 years
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
ago um so it's not new I mean it reminds
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
me of the
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
competencies I mean Vision 2.0 for New
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was developed under the
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
directorship of commissioner Barry when
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
all school districts had to develop
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
their own competencies in all the main
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
subjects that's not new either um so I
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
think we need to let the people in the
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
department who are The Specialist to
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
support our school districts to ensure
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
kids no matter how they're educated or
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
where they're educated get get the skill
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
set that we want out of a productive
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
student can I just you any questions
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
could I ask one yeah um how do you think
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
this does not address all
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
kids because it talks about um wait a
 
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
minute looking at the wrong one is it is
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
it designed for local school districts
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
and charted Public Schools
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes well there are kids out there in
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
Learning Centers and nonsectarian
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
schools aren't there or am I thinking
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
that all kids are here right I'm I was
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
trying to address public education in
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
this only public education yes okay well
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I say we're we're missing
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to be
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
Equitable I've had no problems you know
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
addressing public school kids in this
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
without getting into non-public school
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
kids I have one more comment myself um I
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
administered the nape for the state of
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
Vermont prior to getting on board and
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
coming in the legislature here and the
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
results you see in the nape I wouldn't
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
give a whole lot of uh consideration
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
I saw students in there taking this test
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
just because they had to be there the
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
test wasn't written in a fashion that
 
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
you were going to get anything out of
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
the child yeah uh learning style
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
teaching style wasn't even thought of
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
there uh so we we see those types of
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
scores so I I throw the naatee right out
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
the window I do the same thing with our
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment in terms of it's
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
not a diagnostic test no and it doesn't
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
do it it shows perhaps in terms of what
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
what we Norm reference and what we're
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
assessing it shows growth from one year
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
to another in that particular area but
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't glean from or for the
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
teacher where I need to aim some of my
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
instruction in order to see uh a better
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of the part of the skills
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
and knowledge on on the part of the kid
 
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
so I I I I I think that there's a lot
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's going on within School right now
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
that you don't see any statistical data
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
on because they're doing it individually
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
within schools I was teaching a lot of
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
this stuff dealing with phonemics and
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
and phonemes and and fluency and
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
vocabulary and comprehension when I was
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
a teacher in grade four in the
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
1970s and and and I remember what was
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
going on with Paul leather and Jenny
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
Barry uh on this as well I I I support
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
the idea here that we have to get our
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
reading literacy I don't buy into the
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the concept that 42% of our kids in
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
the state are not proficient in Reading
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
I don't buy into that I don't think the
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
assessment really assesses properly
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's a lot more to this
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
I think we always should be striving to
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
improve our reading to improve our
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
mathematics uh yes we have to do that
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
and uh uh but you know I I I I like a
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the stuff in here don't
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstand me but I just don't know
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
if we're if it's the right way to do it
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
know I got a lot more thought to give to
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
this you know part of the um data
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
flowchart is also using faded measures
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a number you're
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
not going to get a statistic from it but
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
if you do a running record what we call
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
a running record on a student you're
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to get some fluency yeah and
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to compare it or um if
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
you're drilling on uh site words you're
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
not going to necessarily score that
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see how many site words
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
do they know and then send the list home
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
that they don't know or need to practice
 
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
kids need to practice reading they can't
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
just have a reading instructional lesson
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
without all the other parts you know as
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
you know and you have to practice
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
anything that you're going to get good
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
at and unfortunately some kids only get
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
it in one place um and I was concerned
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
also you had mentioned about a
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
progressive spelling
 
01:22:27.719 --> 01:22:30.510 align:start position:0%
progressive spelling
inventory

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
driven I don't know what what that is
 
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.590 align:start position:0%
driven I don't know what what that is
spelling

01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
spelling
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
inventory is it doing
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
spelling I don't know I mean spelling is
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
taught in conjunction with cursive in
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
conjunction with you know so do they
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
keyboarding in first grade to do now
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
they got to give up keyboarding right
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
because there's no extra time and you
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
got to add cursive but yeah this is like
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
a local Pro this this is all good stuff
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
this all should be done I just
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
question where is it not being done
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
because to me it should be pretty
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
rare Rosen
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
lakus I think in your last comment you
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
just answered my question
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
is you said it was
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
insulting and I'm trying to understand
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
is it insulting because they should
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
already be doing it and a lot of places
 
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
are I know you ran I mean the thing is
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
you ran your schools very well I know
 
01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.709 align:start position:0%
you ran your schools very well I know
you

01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:41.470 align:start position:0%
you
did

01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
and not all school systems are run as
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
well as you ran yours right right and
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so if they're already doing this
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
can't they just say cool we're already
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
doing this we're all set but there are
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
school systems that aren't doing this
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the need for this as
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
you said everybody should be doing this
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's the whole point
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
everybody should be doing this but not
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
our school districts are run as well as
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
you ran
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%

01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%

different cast of characters but
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
primarily the same
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and this is House Bill 623
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%

01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
um and this bill has taken um several uh
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
turns and with
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and we just got a uh new
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh this morning uh based on
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
discussions last week
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
um do do you know if there uh copies
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
available out in the um audience I I put
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
a oh there's some okay great yeah um
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh Amendment uh
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
2375 H and um representative luno since
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um represent Miler is here do you want
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
to just
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh generally tell us about the amendment
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
so so thanks and I'll I'll you know re
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
really this is not something that I've
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
been directly working on I think
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative may may be able to to uh
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
shed more light on it since uh since uh
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
I think this um is part of the U the um
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh work product that came out of the um
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
the teacher shortage and retention um
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
working group um study committee study
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
commission it was I think it's been a
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
multi multi-year effort yes yeah so um
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is uh is the Miler
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh 237
 
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:23.629 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh 237
uh

01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
mirrors we're just double-checking this
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
mirrors a Senate Bill uh that has uh has
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
traction over on the other side of the
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
wall Senate Bill
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
217 and uh uh but but Rick I defer to
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
you to you know okay I I'd be I pleased
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
to do that uh the education uh shortage
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee has been addressing this issue
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
and why we have shortages of of of
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
teachers in certain critical shortage
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
areas and we know those critical
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
shortage areas we've mentioned them over
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
and over and over science mathematics
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
special education uh to some degree
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education but we won't
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
go there with that right now um the and
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill that you have
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
before you the amendment
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
623 mirrors
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
sb217 which is pleasantly retained in
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate under uh Senator Ward's
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee but where does this come from
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
it comes from the state of Idaho which
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
just put this almost identical
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
legislation into law and what it does it
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
tries to uh maintain or attract teachers
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the shortage areas um and I don't
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
know if this bill specifically
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
identifies what the shortage areas are
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
but we know we are short teachers in
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
some areas within the state when it
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
comes to lure and certification we've
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
been told by um Mr applebe Steve that we
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
have licensed more teachers in this
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
state than we have in previous years
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
however then you have to dig down into
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
the weeds and find out yeah how many of
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
those licenses are for people living in
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
Nevada who have New Hampshire uh
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
certification they're just renewing them
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
and how many people are on retirement
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
now that are renewing them just to keep
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
something in the fire in terms of that's
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
my insurance policy if I have to get
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
so but we do know we have shortage areas
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
and those I've mentioned uh Idaho has
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
done this by uh saying to a uh a new
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
teacher that comes in or a person that's
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
there in a critical shortage area or in
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
a rural area that can't attract or loses
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh qualified teachers to other districts
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
which pay more that in the first year
 
01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
you get X number dollars second third
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
fourth and by the if you stay there the
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
four years then you C captured $122,000
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
to help pay off your Grant which has
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
been very successful out in Idaho very
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
success so successful in other states in
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
the country so we on the shortage
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee the other day when we're
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap up we're not totally
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
wrapped up yet because there's another
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
issue which we have to resolve but we
 
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
have wrapped up in agreement that this
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
process is important and that we should
 
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective move this
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
forward the only issue out there still
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
is how much is it going to cost and so
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
that's a finance issue which is going to
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
have to be resolved by division two or
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
by the Senate side in in uh uh Senator
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
Gray's committee there so but I
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
encourage us to take a good look at this
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
and and see if it parallels uh what we
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
feel we have to do in terms of keeping
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
and acquiring the teachers we need in
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
the state there's some areas we just
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
cannot find the number of teachers we
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
need and then when it comes to
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining them and keeping them uh
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
that with their extreme debt that
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
they're carrying out from you know the
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
the four-year degree that they possess
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's no way they can stay in the
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
teaching business they got to get back
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
out and seek something where maybe with
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
some Corporation or business that's
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
going to pay them almost another 30% on
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
top of what they're getting paid right
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
now so that's it in a nutshell uh it
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
echoes Idaho this bill almost verbatim e
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
Echoes that state and it echoes 217
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
which is in the Senate and we asked
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Miler modify HB
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
623 W language that's in
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
217 and I haven't taken the time to read
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
through this yet I just got it I've just
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
been doing s yeah and that's probably
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
what we ought to do uh the only area
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
that I because I know this is going to
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
cost some dollars but I don't know how
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
much that's something we're going to
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
have to get from the
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
Department um an analysis in that regard
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
but I is it going to be for any teacher
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
that comes in from any institution be it
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or be it Outsider state
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
is it going to be for any area like an
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher going to have the
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
same benefits from this program or are
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
we going to key it in initially with the
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
this is direct to Rural and right this
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
is going deeper I was saying it's for
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
science mathematics special education
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
Etc right uh yes yeah I just wondered
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
what that rural School District list
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
would look like if it's fewer than 20y
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
old students per square mile within an
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
area that's one criteria right and the
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
other one is is
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
shortage in a certain area like critical
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
shortage list is that what the inent the
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
the other states are doing it they're
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
they're defining rule differently in
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
each state and I think that this would
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
be an area that we should have defined
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
here we've had uh definitions for
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated schools in the
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
state before in legislation that has not
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
passed but this is an area I agree we
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
need to look at this particular area and
 
01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
see is this going to capture the areas
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
capture yes and I I mean I just see it
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
as a great marketing tool for those
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
areas that can't find people I mean AOL
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
School K to8 has 13 kids who the heck
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
wants to go teach in arrol New Hampshire
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
when there's no housing anyway in the
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
distan is good fishing well yes but I I
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
just use that as an example but I'd be
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
curious to see what that list of rural
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
school districts would look like to make
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we're
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
capturing you know those areas because
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
the there are areas like that I'm sure
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
state right in terms of the the dollars
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
I think that there is an appropriation
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
on page three so um there is an
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation anyway for this um you how
 
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.270 align:start position:0%
appropriation anyway for this um you how
many

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
teachers at um what cost um you know
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be uh um compensated under this
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation um however it does the
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
last line uh was added that the governor
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
would draw a warrant article um to fill
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
out that uh money from the
 
01:41:38.679 --> 01:41:40.229 align:start position:0%
out that uh money from the
treasury

01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
um uh so yeah and one of my questions
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
also was related um to the uh specific
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
areas of teaching um that have been
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
discussed um special education was was
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned um but I also uh a couple of
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
us were talking with the U special
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
education Advocate um this
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
weekend um and uh based on her work so
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
far um she identified not only special
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
ed teachers but also occupational
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
therapists speech language Pathologists
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh reading specialists
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
as areas where there are uh teacher
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
shortages um that are impacting special
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
education and the actual services that
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
are in IEPs for students that cannot be
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
provided because of um those shortages
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I was talking about the 13 IEP
 
01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
categories with underneath the umbrella
 
01:42:46.109 --> 01:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
of Special Ed soid I would capture all
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
those categories of the IEPs so that
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
includes occupational therapy those that
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
are working with uh TBI those uh all
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
that autism specialist spe Pathologists
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
right so so so just to be just to be
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
clear though um uh Senate Bill 217 and
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 623 is directed to Rural and
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
underserved um areas and it does not um
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
make any there there's no further
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
criteria in terms of what what teaching
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
areas are are you know where the
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
incentive would apply so it to all
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
teaching areas for these for these uh um
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
Rural and
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
underserved uh districts so you know
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
possibly another bill could you know
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
with another appropriation open it up to
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
all districts and and and specific uh
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
teaching areas but I don't think that's
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
this bill okay um you know it's my
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of it again I I did not
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
serve um on the uh the this multi-year
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
Commission um and and this is work
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
product that came from that so I I'm we
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
we talked about this and as you note on
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment that Mel has just given us
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh on line two a page two it talks about
 
01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantage of the school
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
based on eligibility for funds pursuant
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
two Title One Part a um we're trying to
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
be able to capture places like
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester right uh which are are having
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
a difficult time you
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
know getting these people and
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining these keeping them so it's
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
not just Rule and so we we put in this
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
and of course that yeah and this is
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
where the department has some has some
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
leeway to to extend that um this program
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
to areas that it identifies under Roman
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.629 --> 01:44:51.639 align:start position:0%
page with exactly what you just
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
said you're right so I I think we've
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
been looking at the definition section
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
which talks about Rural and underserved
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
but actually there's the third area as
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
you point out
 
01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.350 align:start position:0%
you point out
yep

01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you so I think you
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
just answered what my question was but I
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm understanding
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
the way it's stated here
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
correctly so number and number two at
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
the top of page
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
two qualifying schools would either be
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
rural isolation as previously defined on
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
page one or economic disadvantage based
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
on title one they would not have to be
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
both is that the correct interpretation
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
I believe so one or the other y so it
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
fixes the issue of the Claremont and
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
Newports and manchesters that are not
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
rural thank you um my I guess based on
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
your question would um that also cover
 
01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
your question would um that also cover
the

01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
underserved areas which are in the
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
definitions but are
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
2 should there be a a b and c under
 
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:18.669 align:start position:0%
2 should there be a a b and c under
Roman

01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
2 represent tell I
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
concur representative Paul you got a
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you um I'm so
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about that teacher who's
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
teaching let's I'm going to sell these
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
Town out so maybe they don't fit on the
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
list but not but let's say someone's
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
teaching in gton and they've been there
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
for two years it's a new teacher they've
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
been there for two years and they're
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
Rift they're an excellent teacher and
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
they end up going to Berlin if Berlin's
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
on the list or Errol or wherever through
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
they've been kicked out of a an
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
underserved District because it's any
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
subject so now they get a job in cber or
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
whatever another underserved District
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's like I said they have no control
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
over their performance other than they
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
were an excellent teacher but they were
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
Rift um so they don't they're done they
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
can't get any more money and that
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem fair to me it seems
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
like if they are serving those districts
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
so when we go to page two um line 20
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
lines 24 and
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
25 the educator remains employed at the
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
same school or the same school district
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're out and that doesn't seem very
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
fair to
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
me represent
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
Damon so could we propose in response to
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's valid
 
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
concern that instead of it reading on
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
line 2425 of page
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
two uh remains employed at the same
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
school or by the same school district to
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
change that to remains employed at any
 
01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.589 align:start position:0%
change that to remains employed at any
qualifying

01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
District so they did that example they
 
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
qualified um one one of the the goals
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
was to try to keep these people in that
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
rural School
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
District they may jump they may jump as
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
represent Hall saying from let's say a
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
havil where I am to
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hanover and receive a huge jump in their
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
salary now course then they wouldn't
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
qualify because they'd be out because
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's not an
 
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.149 align:start position:0%
it's not an
underserved

01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
District yeah I but see it's also
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
hurting though the the the rural
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
District which is going to see that jump
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
occur and once again you don't have
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
continuity programming you lose that
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
teacher which has been very effective
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
now gone and it's going to impact on
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
kids can I follow up on it sure but
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own they went
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
there hoping to stay there five years to
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
be able to take advantage of this
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to stay there five years
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
and they've been rifted that is they
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
have no control over that
 
01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
have no control over that
none

01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
so you know how can you be guaranteed if
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're good you're going to be allowed
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
to stay there for 5
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
years I don't
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
know and and why would they be leaving
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
if they were if there were reduction in
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
force often times the language is Last
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Man in first man out mind you they have
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
five years to decide you know the
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent has five years to decide
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that there are certainly
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
teachers that would fall into this at
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
some point in time they get riffed and
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
they want to want to teach and an they
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
like being in the North country or
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
wherever that is and they go to another
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
underserved District like say through no
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
fault of their own so so they want to
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
stay there for five years Mel if I could
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
if I could respond to that
 
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
um down on Roman three at the top of
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
page two there's this this you know this
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
program laid out in statute gets defined
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
in rules adopted by the commission
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 541a so that's where the the
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know where where what you're talking
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
about could be placed in rules it you
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
know the you know the the statute
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily statute frames it up
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
but the rules specify what would what
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
would happen so I I would I would
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
suggest that this frames it up pretty
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
well and some of these Edge conditions
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about are absolutely
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
valid but that could be done during the
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
01:50:44.719 --> 01:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
rule making
process

01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
um you know it may be it may be too
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
difficult to consider every Edge every
 
01:50:53.159 --> 01:50:54.109 align:start position:0%
difficult to consider every Edge every
corner

01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
corner
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
statute and um and the other thing is I
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
I think we do have another retained bill
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the um what the um
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.589 align:start position:0%
 
do

01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
right yeah oh yeah so this is putting a
 
01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
couple of a couple of um
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
of requirements on the higher education
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
commission to Define eligible education
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
expenses and to adopt
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
rules and I think the higher education
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
commission can do both of those
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
things but they would be the ones
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
administering this um this incentive
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
Grant it says they shall adopt
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
clearly further yes represent
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
D um just clarifying from what
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
representative luno just said because we
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
in the corner here have the same
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
question so can the
 
01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.069 align:start position:0%
question so can the
rules

01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
development say something that is
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually different from the language of
 
01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:16.510 align:start position:0%
actually different from the language of
the

01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
five yeah I mean there there has to be a
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
statutory underpinning for the for the
 
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.550 align:start position:0%
statutory underpinning for the for the
rules

01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
um being employed at the same school or
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
um I mean we I mean we could get a I
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
mean we could ask you know an OLS
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
attorney about about you know that um
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
you know if wanted to get some
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
yeah you just pointed out something to
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
me something that I had marked on a
 
01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.030 align:start position:0%
me something that I had marked on a
previous

01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.790 align:start position:0%
previous
version

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
rules you should say state
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:28.069 align:start position:0%
rules you should say state
board

01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
commission you know and I'm not sure how
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
we word it in other I I
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
one more thank you no different okay so
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just noting that in this amendment
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous one on page one
 
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.750 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous one on page one
line

01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
16 um it no longer includes Federal
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Parent loans the other Amendment did
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
include them as is that in order to
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:21.390 align:start position:0%
 
has

01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%
qualified does anyone know um if there
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
has been any uh action over in the
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
Senate on their routine no they they
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything yet anything okay
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
and once again this legislation is just
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
an echo of what happened out west and
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
they have been uh you know doing it for
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
some time now effectively um to get back
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the area that you had uh Muriel um on
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
on those lines on the on the reverse
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
side um employed at the same school or
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
by the same school district um you could
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
capture it by saying taking line latter
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
part of line 23 on page one remains
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
employed in an eligible Public School
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
District or at an eligible Charter
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
Public School um you just take it from
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
that same language which is line 23 and
 
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
24 on the first page and replace where
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
it says the same school same district
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
all that stuff
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
on so we could we could get around that
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
you could be in an eligible
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
school which would have to meet those
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines already established within
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
yep be a simple
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
fix so there could be two or three um
 
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.639 align:start position:0%
fixes in an amendment that I see um that
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned um on the top of
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
page two maybe make it a b and c to
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
include the
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
underserved um and on line
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
33 um who's adopting the rules and the
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
fourth change we we'd have to assess the
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
definition as represent cadens what what
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
is a rural district is is it 20 enrolled
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
students per square mile or or is there
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
some other appropriate way
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we we do that we do that but is
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
that good for our state how many how
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
many schools are captured by that we
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.870 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
mil it's geographically isolated though
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the state yeah and and
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
then you've also got the HHS list too
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes that's right that's next line down
 
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:54.870 align:start position:0%
yes that's right that's next line down
yeah

01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
um okayy I think there's three or four
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
things then that uh we can take a look
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
at um the rule definition um including
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
to the other three um areas that we just
 
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
just mentioned um for the
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
13th uh representative beler thank you
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I know I it sounds like you
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
guys have done quite a bit of work on
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
this and Advance things uh a fair bit
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
forward um but I wanted to just step
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
back and point out a couple things that
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
that seem like they could be issues to
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
me um the first the first thing i' would
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
like to point out is if if retention
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
issues are are primarily or majorly
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
related to benefits packages being
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
inadequate it doesn't make a ton of
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
sense to me why we are looking to go
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
straight to student loan forgiveness
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
rather than simply increasing pay
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
packages where teachers on an individual
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
level would have the ability to direct
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
those funds where they feel most
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate at any given time we all
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
know that housing there's a housing
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
crisis housing is very expensive they
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
could then choose to use those funds to
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
buy a home if that's where we're heading
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
if we need to increase if we need to
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
increase the benefits package that seems
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to me I would also
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
point out that this appears to single
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
out only Federal loans as being eligible
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness I I'm not sure why we
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
would want to um exclude uh private loan
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
providers from this particular
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
program um I would point out that
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
looking to specifically subsid or rather
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
pay for student loans does effectively
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
have the Dual track of not only
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
increasing benefit packages but it also
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
effectively subsidizes Advanced degree
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
programs and from where I stand I don't
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
like the idea of of doing that and I
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it also fails to address a primary
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
cause of retention problems in schools
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
which is teachers being regularly abused
 
01:59:02.189 --> 01:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
by students where there is not a lot of
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
Avenue under our current guidelines to
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
be able to take corrective actions um I
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
bit good points is to yeah um the
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
situation representative C Ken um yeah I
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
agree I mean teachers are having a
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
difficult time because of the abuse by
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
students and verbal abuse by parents but
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
I I believe that it
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
can't we can't put money into the
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
salaries to increase them because that's
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
a negotiated item and they're bound to a
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
agreement and I don't know if there are
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
districts that have actually loan
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness in their collective
 
01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement maybe Muriel
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
knows but that's why I think it's
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
common yes thank you I'm just thinking
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
so if it's in even if it's in a
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
bargaining contract um if the town
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
chooses not to fund that contract let's
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
say you you negotiate a settlement and
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't fund
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
it right so then you don't have the
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
money H I'm thinking out loud here
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah that's all I was thinking
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
like sometimes the money is not there
 
02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.189 align:start position:0%
like sometimes the money is not there
even

02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
though they fund a number of teachers
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
and then the and the town votes to cut
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
the budget by a million dollars now
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to get rid of teachers that
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
have any further I think well the the
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
the teacher shortage committee is coming
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
up with 10 separate recommendations this
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
is one of those
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations so in terms of some of
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
what you represent mentioned represent
 
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
beler those like the the teacher that's
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
being assaulted by students in the
 
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
classroom or pushed downstairs breaking
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
their hip like my daughter had happened
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
to her when she was teaching at the
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
middle school in St John's spray
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont those we we are addressing those
 
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
types of issues through the shortage
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
committee recommendations this one right
 
02:01:39.629 --> 02:01:39.639 align:start position:0%
here where is trying to really narrow
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
down this one area how we might retain
 
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
them with this extra support to help pay
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
off their debt and that was echoed to
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
was over and over and over again
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
teachers are coming with huge debt and
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why they don't
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
even want to get in the teaching
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
profession right now because who's going
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay off a debt of you know
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
$440,000 when your salaries to or
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
getting you're getting paid $38,000 to
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
start out with it's just you're in that
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
hole and then capture the housing cost
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
which you've alluded to and everything
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
else associated with they just can't
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
afford it and we recognize it you know
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
when you come right down to it this this
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
$122,000 is when it compared to some of
 
02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:27.639 align:start position:0%
those debts that we heard is a fraction
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
however it
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
helps and um where we've seen it
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually proven elsewhere than the the
 
02:02:38.109 --> 02:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely felt that this is a
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
a a a track we should try to explore and
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
take is one one of the possible answers
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we have to come up with just one
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
aspect and Brian you were there
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh I know you gave a lot of input and
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
you were the one that really identify
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
for us that this did come from Idaho or
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
this has has been put into effect Mr
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
chair could could Brian come forward
 
02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
chair could could Brian come forward
please

02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
sure from your perspective in in the uh
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh of all the teachers in the field that
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
you work with Mr Hawkins um how how is
 
02:03:27.149 --> 02:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
perceived and and can you give us any
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a background in why this tact
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
was taken working with Mr applebe over
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
to uh doe sure for the record Brian
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
Hawkins and Y New Hampshire um I think
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
this is uh perceived as you know
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
reducing barriers to to entering the
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
profession and we know that the pipeline
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
of uh people coming into the profession
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
has taken um a hit it was uh referenced
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
earlier uh about
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
licenses uh the just take a look at the
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
newspaper and the job advertisements and
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh it is a a major struggle um there and
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh so this is this is uh not the uh
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
Panacea but it is an important component
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
I think to um in in in a multifaceted
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
way to to address the
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
issue um one uh in uh with respect to
 
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
Idaho this uh has been a very success
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
they've had a
 
02:04:37.719 --> 02:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
they've had a
successful

02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
successful
 
02:04:42.669 --> 02:04:42.679 align:start position:0%
uh time with this um to begin with
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there are some
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
similarities there with New Hampshire as
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
well um and um this was some of what we
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
heard in the shortage committee where
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
you had districts that need people to uh
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
to move to rural areas in order to uh
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
fill some of these positions and so this
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
can be helpful one one additional um
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
question that was raised I think I can
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
answer is um in addition to the uh
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
definition on Rural uh the Senate Bill
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
adds the rural public health network uh
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that borrows from the state loan
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
repayment program that is already in
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
place by the Department of Health and
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
Human Services that program uh is for uh
 
02:05:32.549 --> 02:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and um so that is a
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
already uh comes directly from their uh
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
the definition that they use for Rural
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
um and you can even look at a map online
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
to see exactly where that is um
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
um using their
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
criteria so something already being some
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
something already in place and has been
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
a very successful program in healthc
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
care for the for the Department um they
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
were able to uh uh give that program an
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
infusion of um Federal money um but
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh and and and and and they have had u a
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
great deal of success since they've been
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
able to um put that additional funding
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
in I hope that
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
helps any further questions U yes
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
you for being here to provide this uh
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
information I just wanted to ask based
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
on what I one of the things I had said
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that the the issues around the
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
contract could be worked out would the
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh would the Nea support a move if we
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
were to take this bill and amend it to
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
say instead of providing direct student
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness we just take that money
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
paychecks well I
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
think I think the best way to do that is
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
I mean schools are run by people and uh
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
you can't educate kids without uh the uh
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
staff and the professionals there and I
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
think that goes back to the school
 
02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
funding issue overall where you know the
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
degree I mean because many of the
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
districts I think we're talking about
 
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
that would fall into some of this are uh
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
both Rural and underserved and um their
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
ability to deliver higher salaries we
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
were talking about Newport versus
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hanover is so much a function of um the
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
economics and the way we fund schools so
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:07:46.549 --> 02:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the being able to deliver some of
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
the targeted funding that the
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has considered is helpful um
 
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I think I would definitely support
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
continuing to do that because I think we
 
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
we should do more in that area and I
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
think when you look at the ways in which
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
school districts are uh deploying those
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
funds it's to help keep
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
people uh and and and attract
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
people and we haven't even gotten into
 
02:08:15.549 --> 02:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
par professionals and support staff
 
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
which is a whole another issue but um we
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
could spend a lot you know a whole
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
another hour on that or more one of the
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
things M thank you Mr chair one of the
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
things that the shortage committee did
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
discuss if the payment went to paying
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
off the loan then the young teacher or
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
the teacher that's coming in and
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
collecting this uh this uh support would
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
then have money in their paycheck
 
02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
to put more towards housing because they
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having to pay off such a
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
high debt in the course the interest and
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
all that so it was to be
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
consistent um the the process would be
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
similar for everybody receiving these
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
types of support because we'd be working
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
with the higher education institution
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
are paying off debt uh and it's through
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government and all that so
 
02:09:13.149 --> 02:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
we were trying to keep it accountable to
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
trying to wipe out that debt which we've
 
02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:17.559 align:start position:0%
heard so much for that's why a lot of
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
folks aren't getting education right now
 
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
they're coming out buried in this stuff
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
and they got to we got to attract them
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
in and if we can help lessen that debt
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
them um one question um I wanted to go
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
back to if I could um back to the uh
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
teaching areas that were mentioned
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
before um if this is not the right
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle for that because it's uh
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
targeted to Rural and served areas is
 
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
there another vehicle that we see coming
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
down the
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
pike um maybe identified by the shortage
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee that would be um the proper
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle for addressing
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
you or is that something
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
that we need to address at this point uh
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's a a question for
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
maybe Steve applebe who's very familiar
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
with those areas which are shortage
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
where they are in the state and what are
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
the subject areas the shortage is is in
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh we we have discussed it and and uh
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
certainly we we'd like to be able to
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
attract teachers to these rural areas or
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
to the underserved areas or those which
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
economics to support
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
attract and I'd like to see it for all
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
categories in those schools however if
 
02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:00.559 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to be cautious here to
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
initially get something in place
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's wiser to go with you know
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
we know that we have absolutely a high
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
preponderance of shortage Area Teachers
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
a math science special in these rurual
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
and economically depressed areas we do
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a shortage there we have in the in
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
the state too seeing that even though
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
you may be in a district where you're
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
paying you know maybe
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
$70,000 that's not going to attract the
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
technology person that's going to get $1
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
110 $120,000 by going off and working
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
for BP so uh it's is a hard one to
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
tackle and I I think the committee right
 
02:11:43.549 --> 02:11:43.559 align:start position:0%
now is trying to look at this
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
incrementally and you know even I
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
suggest at the very beginning do we have
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
to even go in down down further and
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
identify those subject areas where
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're teaching in um that might be a
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
nightmare to try to administer that
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
program it might be easier just to say
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
qualify okay no further comments I think
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
we've got um a little bit of language
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
work to do and um maybe some research on
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
Rural schools um for the
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
13th um so uh with that we'll uh end
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee and um turn it over to
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
Chairman lad for the uh 11 o'clock let's
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:20:48.990 align:start position:0%
 
break

02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.429 --> 02:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
okay I think we ought to go ahead and
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.990 --> 02:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
today the first of which we're going to
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
in support uh represent Damon who has to
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
got it get out of here who's not in her
 
02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.429 align:start position:0%
got it get out of here who's not in her
seat

02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
seat
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
yet moving fast okay and she has an
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
amendment for 505 uh that's uh relative
 
02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental
 
02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
Health uh education in
 
02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
schools and wellness education in
 
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
schools so um why don't you uh explain
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
what you have as an amendment here
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um this is from discussion at the last
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
two work sessions I believe and it is
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
very simple to explain it simply removes
 
02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
the word
 
02:21:47.469 --> 02:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive which was in the bill uh
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
um in the title of it under an act and
 
02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
in the text of it as well so literally
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
it just takes out that word
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive before mental health
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
education um and makes
 
02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
it let's say more
 
02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
generalized okay given that we were not
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
be okay um further discussion from the
 
02:22:19.630 --> 02:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
committee on that
 
02:22:23.230 --> 02:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
one further discussion for folks here
 
02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:28.030 align:start position:0%
one further discussion for folks here
represent

02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
dry so I guess my question
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
is I looked at what was already going on
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the schools and in the the um
 
02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum and to me it was everything
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
that I would suspect I would want to see
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
in a mental health curriculum and I'm
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
thinking mental health while a problem
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
is is the the the headline problem right
 
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
now and I don't like to make
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
lists um because you always leave
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
something out and you have to keep
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
changing it um it is to my satisfaction
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
that what I would expect a mental health
 
02:23:11.309 --> 02:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum to cover is already being
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
covered so I'm I'm I appreciate the the
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
fact of of trying to make this
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
fit but it it goes against the way I
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
legislation further discussion represent
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
P Pell I just want to say that I agree
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
100% with representative dry thank you
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
Margaret further discussion yes
 
02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
Margaret further discussion yes
represent

02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
Amon I'd just like to respond to those
 
02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
Amon I'd just like to respond to those
thoughtful

02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
remarks the fact that it may be
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
happening adequately in some school
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
districts at this time does not diminish
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the need for us to specify that should
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
be happening in all school districts
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing if it's not in statute when the
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
306 rules are revised What's Happening
 
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Now can go away and that's not good for
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
kids represent cordelli thank you I
 
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
think that I to my satisfaction anyway
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it's been indicated that uh mental
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
health will remain in the
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
306 uh rules
 
02:24:21.269 --> 02:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
um and um I I think that current
 
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
language talks about health education
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
certainly um for me that means both
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
physical and and mental health so I'm
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
I'm uh fine with uh the current um
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
language in
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
law okay we do know that it's going to
 
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
remain in the 306 we have statutory
 
02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.790 align:start position:0%
remain in the 306 we have statutory
language

02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
193e which which stipulates that the
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
areas which are identified in the
 
02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
section one of that part of the statute
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing those substantive
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
criteria areas of
 
02:24:59.950 --> 02:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
study those cannot be changed or

02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
rule unless approved by the general
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
court and so we've been told that this
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
is one of those substantive areas health
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
and wellness that cannot be changed in
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
rule so what is in rule will remain in
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
rule so
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
but I I want to also read a a little bit
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
that came out of hb2 that's a bill that
 
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
was passed and went into law 2 um
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
approved in 2023 June
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
20th it says findings Children's Mental
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
Health the general court recognizes that
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
the ongoing mental health substance
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and Child Protection
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
crisis have taken a significant toll on
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's children families and
 
02:25:46.319 --> 02:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's children families and
taxpayers

02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire schools are challenged
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
daily to support the behavioral needs of
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
students while promoting academic
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
achievement for all students and it goes
 
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
on and talks about mental health and
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
wellness um so it's been placed in hb2
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
and signed into
 
02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
law but we have no reference to it
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
underneath studies and so my my concern
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
is do we put that in underneath studies
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
or not um I I handed out and I've looked
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
at it and I've done some twisting around
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
on this um however I feel that when
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about health and wellness
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
under studies we are talking about
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
mental health it's a part of our our
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
health program we've identified it both
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
what I just read right here but also in
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
our uh uh Frameworks for health and and
 
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
we know it's in in
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
rule by placing it in studies we would
 
02:26:57.309 --> 02:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
even more strongly guarantee that it
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
remains part of Health and
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
Wellness I also felt like well you know
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
we could also put the word nutrition in
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
there too seeing that our our areas of
 
02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
306 and and uh Frameworks address the
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
issue of nutrition as part of curriculum
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's also referenced to later in stat
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
too so I I I I actually think that we we
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
won't have to do that but I I just like
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
to throw it out there and say why then
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
are we not
 
02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to put this in
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
statute under studies is there a reason
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
for it when we're already doing
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
it and we all have it in hb2 represent
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
dry I think Health has a number of
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
facets that aren't listed there um
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
emotional health spiritual
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
health things that maybe haven't hit the
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
headlines yet that we're g to have is a
 
02:27:57.150 --> 02:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
crisis coming down the road I just think
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
that if you put it Broad in the statute
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh make it specific in the rules and
 
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
Damon I wish
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
that the general understanding of the
 
02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:22.349 align:start position:0%
that the general understanding of the
term

02:28:22.349 --> 02:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
Health included mental health as a basic
 
02:28:29.309 --> 02:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
component mental health physical health
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
all under the umbrella of
 
02:28:35.790 --> 02:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
Health but that is not the language of
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
our society today in hardly any context
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
that I've been involved in I think it's
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
really quite quite
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
important that we incorporate
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
that simple two-word phrase mental
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
health as something that we want our
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
students to be educated
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
about further discussion on this
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
one yes represent cordelli thank you I
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I pick up the uh newspaper or um look
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
at articles on uh online and uh uh
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
there's not many days that go by I don't
 
02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
see something about mental health in
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
schools um so I don't think that
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
awareness um is the issue and just um
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
adding it to what is already in statute
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
um will make any
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and I mean I
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
I gave a significant presentation and I
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
I won't rehash all the details of that
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
here right now we can we can go back and
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
look at that but I I will once again say
 
02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:47.790 align:start position:0%
look at that but I I will once again say
that

02:29:47.790 --> 02:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
we are looking to solve a problem here
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
in mental health that is very
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
clearly something that we are also
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
causing at the same time at least in
 
02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
significant part through the way that
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
we're conducting ourselves in our
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
schools and the way that we go about
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
doing things this was clear in testimony
 
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard before we see the evidence
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
for this everywhere further we know from
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the mere statements of the
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
professional organizations involved the
 
02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
mental health field by and large is a
 
02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
mental health field by and large is a
captured

02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
captured
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
institution it is placing things like
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
activism and social justice above its
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
ethical duties and that is what we're
 
02:30:31.269 --> 02:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
looking to be instituting here I I think
 
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's off
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
topic I I I object to that discussion as
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
part of this going on in
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
schools okay let's uh just jump past
 
02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the things we want to be I
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
I'll see that we have this is a
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee the whole we're all here um on
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
all these bills which we're going to
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
have this year coming at it's all 100
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
plus bills and the 20 that we've
 
02:30:59.230 --> 02:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
retained we are going to have to utilize
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
our time uh effectively and efficiently
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
and we if we're going to say things we
 
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
better make sure that we have the facts
 
02:31:13.150 --> 02:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
and the signs behind us and that we have
 
02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh something to offer that's going to
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
be relative to this bill now yes that
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was relative to the bill what was
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
just mentioned by represent elure he
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
indicated that you know he's feeling
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
that within the schools that uh you know
 
02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
we're bringing some of this on ourselves
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
and yeah we're we're we're doing that to
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
an area of
 
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
nutrition we're putting a Coke machine
 
02:31:35.710 --> 02:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
out in every corner of the of our lives
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
and we're doing this and that and
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
everything so
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
um it's the classroom the teachers which
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
are having to deal with us on a daily
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:47.590 align:start position:0%
are having to deal with us on a daily
basis

02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know I have I've not been in
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
a classroom where I have never seen need
 
02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
for a good teacher to be able to have a
 
02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
grasp on how to correct
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior mental
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
Wellness of students there uh you're
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to do it if if you if you
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
don't have them on board you're not
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to be teaching anything
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
academically so it's an it's important
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
topic and um and so is physical activity
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've also been told you know
 
02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
take the kids out and run around the
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
soccer field a couple times before you
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
get into the academics and they'll calm
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
down and they'll probably learn better
 
02:32:29.389 --> 02:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I used to do that as a fourth grade
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
teacher and the kids really did achieve
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
well after they've been out there and
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
got themselves a little bit tired and
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing occurs with a a good meal
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you they're not if they're hungry
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
they're not going to learn and that's
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
all part of Health I had it as a young
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
kid in school that was part of the
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
instruction and and and behavior was
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
part of that instruction um
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately somebody I didn't listen
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
to but um so be it so um let's let's go
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
on here and any further discussion on
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
505 yes represent repent
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
no um in the health education curriculum
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines from 2003 the definition of
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
health education is a planned sequential
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
cas through 12 program that addresses
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
the physical mental emotional and social
 
02:33:24.269 --> 02:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
dimensions of Health has that my first
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
question is has that definition changed
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years and um if that
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
definition stays I would um
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
recommend um that this whole section
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be Consolidated because it has
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
begun to become too specific in terms of
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we are requesting the teachers
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
teach their children the children and
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
they are already overburdened with the
 
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
with the issues that we continue to lay
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
on them as
 
02:33:54.269 --> 02:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
legislators okay I'm going to take an
 
02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to finish reading what I
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
what's in hb2 it goes on and says in
 
02:34:00.269 --> 02:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
response to the New Hampshire Department
 
02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
of Education uh C's office of Social and
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
emotional Wellness has supported
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 37 New Hampshire school
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
districts in implementing an
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based prevention framework to
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
support behavioral health and wellness
 
02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
of all students called multi-tiered
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
system Sy of support for Behavioral
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Wellness or mtssb mtssb is a
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
key component of the system of care
 
02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
established under RSA
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
135f so this is something that's being
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
pushed by our own Department of
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
Education to recognizing that we've got
 
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
to do something uh regarding the
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
behaviors that staff members are
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing in these
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
schools and there's a system of tiers
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
now of course we you all know the one
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
two and three tiers and what three
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
stands for that's you know where you're
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
really in need of some medical type
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
support um but it's the teacher on tier
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
one that's involved with this and you've
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
got to be able recognize that um we
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
can't close our eyes to it we can't bury
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
our head in the
 
02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
sand represent
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I agree with
 
02:35:12.479 --> 02:35:13.429 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I agree with
your

02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
remarks I'd like to ask the folks
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
who do not support this to be specific
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
please about what in this you don't
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
consider important for students to
 
02:35:33.269 --> 02:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
learn what is it that you want to not be
 
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
Prof I don't think we're saying that
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't important for the students to
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
to learn I think we're saying they're
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
learning it already and we don't see the
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
statute further discussion
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yeah I just go
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
back to um some comments I made at the
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh last meeting on this and that um it's
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
nice to put into uh law that you know
 
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
this should be taught and that should be
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
taught but um especially with this area
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh unless we address the root causes of
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
some of the mental health problems in
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
the schools then what are we really
 
02:36:27.269 --> 02:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
accomplishing um I'm thinking of
 
02:36:31.469 --> 02:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
bullying for instance um gotten two
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
calls um in the past um two weeks about
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh cases uh going to uh School boards
 
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship um related
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
to uh to bullying um uh you
 
02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
there are um a number of causes that we
 
02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.990 align:start position:0%
there are um a number of causes that we
can

02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
address and should
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
address other than just putting um
 
02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
another word in in statute we should
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
at further discussion represent
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair um
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
with with respect to what representative
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh just talked about you know
 
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.030 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh just talked about you know
and

02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
bullying it would it would it would
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
appear to me that that codifying mental
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
health education would uh would help to
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
relieve and reduce the uh the instances
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
of of of bullying in in any type of um
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh environment and um and you know the
 
02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
way the way the section in study reads
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
now I think is improved by adding the
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
words mental health um
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
education uh to um to assure that um
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
that that continues to be uh be
 
02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
something that's uh that's taught in
 
02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
schools and not something that that
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
disappears and then we see the the
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
effects of a lack of mental health
 
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
education um manifest in other areas
 
02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
like what we're what representative
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh was talking about um that'd
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
be my comment on on it on the on the the
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
merits of of the of house bu 505 and and
 
02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative Damon
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
puts forward but uh but my other comment
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
is that following our last work
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
session and I don't remember when that
 
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
was I've got it somewhere around here um
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
I uh think so many yeah yeah might uh on
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
October 18th and um and you know I I
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
thought we had sort of agreed that
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
dropping the word comprehensive the uh
 
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
the Bill's Prime sponsor was here and
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
and she said yeah I'll support that cuz
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
I think this moves It Forward I thought
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
we were um in general agreement maybe
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
not 20 to nothing but uh that uh that
 
02:39:03.309 --> 02:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
dropping the word comprehensive was um
 
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
was was going to be how we were going to
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
move this forward so I'm not quite sure
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
what changed between now and then but
 
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative Damon clearly took some
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
instructions or based on what she
 
02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
thought was instructions from the
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee to prepare this amendment
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
um you know based on that work from two
 
02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:23.150 align:start position:0%
um you know based on that work from two
weeks

02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:39:26.110 --> 02:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
ago we have another bill that's uh going
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be decided it's not on the docket for
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
today but it's uh
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
151 DL title that is relative to mental
 
02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:34.750 align:start position:0%
151 DL title that is relative to mental
health

02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
education on is putting mental health
 
02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.469 align:start position:0%
education on is putting mental health
into

02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy and that's coming to us from
 
02:39:44.670 --> 02:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate with bipartisan Senate
 
02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.070 align:start position:0%
the Senate with bipartisan Senate
support

02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
I have a difficult time putting that
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
into adequacy seeing health and wellness
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
is already in adequacy however I see
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
this as the more appropriate Avenue to
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
take of putting it underneath studies as
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
a component of this subject health and
 
02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
wellness and I I just don't understand
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know why
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
um why the would it be S better we put
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
down Behavioral
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
Health uh
 
02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
it yeah there there's representative
 
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
leus I was in Texas the 18th so I wasn't
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
here for that meeting but I'm wondering
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
this paper that you handed out that's
 
02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:39.970 align:start position:0%
this paper that you handed out that's
labeled

02:40:39.970 --> 02:40:39.980 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:41.670 align:start position:0%
labeled
[Music]

02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
um as that it's um as introduced us and
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
then there's all these changes who did
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
all these changes because I do like a
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
lot of what was done with this including
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
fixing the
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
part um where it says these content
 
02:41:01.070 --> 02:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
areas of health education support the
 
02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
safety academic success and wellbeing of
 
02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
students and relate to adding that in
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
there I think make that make a whole lot
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
more sense getting rid of comprehensive
 
02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
was excellent nutrition I think is
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
important in there
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
um where did this come from I wrote that
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
the other night and the bottom part
 
02:41:24.429 --> 02:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
education Sports safety academic success
 
02:41:26.830 --> 02:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
well-being of students and relate to
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
that phraseology came from Texas and I
 
02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
think what we are doing we're starting
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
to write down all these areas of Health
 
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
and Wellness physiology hygiene Health
 
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships those are
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
already in law the only thing we don't
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
have down there is nutrition which is
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
extremely part you know I think we all
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
had you know a a classro in in in
 
02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
elementary school at least I did on you
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
know on nutrition it was part of Health
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
the you know and and and mental health
 
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
is also part of this that's why I
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
thought well this all belonged in one
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
area this area studies needs a real good
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
cleanup and it's it supports the Health
 
02:42:17.230 --> 02:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
and Wellness which is inadequacy but it
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
then further defines it here in studies
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
we did that with personal finance
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
literacy as well represent leus I think
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
you're right on the same page I am in
 
02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
terms of seeing this is a good way of
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
stating what health and wellness is and
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
what are the components of it um by
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
doing this we have them all there now
 
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
because we have interpersonal
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
there so representative
 
02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:46.429 align:start position:0%
there so representative
belard

02:42:46.429 --> 02:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
belard
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair there was a question
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
put to the committee about what
 
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
specifically they might object to as far
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
as being taught under the rubric of this
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill so I would like to put out there
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
one thing that falls under this rubric a
 
02:42:59.070 --> 02:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
statement recently put out by the
 
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
president of the American Psychological
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
Association in regards to what's
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
happened recently in the Middle East let
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
go of the fear let go of the lies let go
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the control issues let go of the
 
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
manipulation let go of the selfishness
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
let go of that which has been stolen let
 
02:43:14.190 --> 02:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
go of the denial let go of the tendency
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
decolonize that is something that I
 
02:43:23.309 --> 02:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
would object to being taught that seems
 
02:43:24.429 --> 02:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
to come under this rubric and you
 
02:43:26.269 --> 02:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to look further than
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
documents put out by the APA to find
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
this same sort of thing within their
 
02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
broad purview of what they now consider
 
02:43:36.429 --> 02:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
to be mental health
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
education further discussion represent
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
dry thank
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
you I think actually that paragraph two
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
is is an example of why I don't like
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
lists is because the first sentence it's
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
health and education health education
 
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
and wellness then it talks about a
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
little broader categories like
 
02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
physiology hygiene health and
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationship and physical
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
education and wellness great if it
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
stopped there that would be good but
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
look at the two things after that you
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
have to do Abus child you have to
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
reference a definition in a different
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
thing that's that's a subject that's
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
come up it's been in the headlines we
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
added it to the statute HIV what the
 
02:44:17.469 --> 02:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
headlines for a long time now it's
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
specifically in there uh this is the the
 
02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
minutia that I think does not belong in
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
Amon I I hope I misunderstood what
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative dry just said because of
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
it if I didn't
 
02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
misunderstand it sounds like you
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
consider child abuse in hi
 
02:44:48.790 --> 02:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
to be minutia and I'm sure that's can't
 
02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:53.590 align:start position:0%
to be minutia and I'm sure that's can't
be

02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
right represent Dr yes represent Dr No
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's not but I believe that it's it's a
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
category that's already covered in the
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
things above that um and it's just a
 
02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
part of we don't want to leave anything
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
out so we have to keep making a list
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's longer and longer and longer and
 
02:45:12.429 --> 02:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
they're all important
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank further discussion
 
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
Rick Rick yes
 
02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
yes are you offering um your your markup
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
as a I I just brought that for
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes uh I'm just looking
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
up uh RSC 126k colon 8 because that is
 
02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
re referenced under the substant
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
criteria under well health and wellness
 
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I was just looking at see and
 
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
that speaks to uh possession let's see
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if you were to look
 
02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
at um underneath the adequacy public
 
02:45:58.590 --> 02:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
education portion 193e colon
 
02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
2A the substant education contentment of
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
an adequate education under Roman one it
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
lists one through 11 subject type areas
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at seven which is health
 
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
health and wellness education comma
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
include a policy for violations of RSA
 
02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:20.750 align:start position:0%
include a policy for violations of RSA
126k

02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
126k
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
81a and if you look at that that goes
 
02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
back to I believe the use of
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco and and so and that was a huge
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
issue in our society and Still Remains
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
such but at that point in time the
 
02:46:37.550 --> 02:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
legislator must have felt that that's
 
02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
important enough to put it underneath
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
the adequate
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
education and supporting it with the
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding for it which that the tobacco
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
revenues coming in the state are used in
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
that direction but you know we just
 
02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
talked about you know the the list of
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
things which go on here at the end U
 
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
like which they
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
referenced U HIV they mentioned you know
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
sexual transmitted diseases Etc like
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's been in law ever since I've been
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
here so I don't know how that got there
 
02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's certainly an area where we're
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
putting a lot into that particular
 
02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
section of law and somewhere along the
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
way this is the area that needs clean up
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
and it needs probably a separate area
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
within something there uh because if
 
02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking up top and we've been
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
drifting towards trying to Define what
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
these studies are and by doing so that's
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
why the support for adding in several of
 
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
the other topics which we have listed
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
under 306 and we have listed that then
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
we'd have it
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
done and then we're going to have to
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
start figuring out you know how to clean
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
up the rest of that statutory area the
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
whole thing needs fixing so so Rick
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
would would it be fair to say then that
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
that under the definition of an adequate
 
02:47:55.359 --> 02:47:56.670 align:start position:0%
that under the definition of an adequate
education

02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
1932a where we've
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
got number seven health and wellness
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
education including a policy for
 
02:48:05.950 --> 02:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
violations and I believe that's the
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
smoking the use of tobacco um that that
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's in the definition of adequate
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
education in what what you and hope have
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
done here under studies
 
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
provides additional clarification and
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
definition as to what what what um
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
health and wellness
 
02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
education should comprise that's exactly
 
02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
what we started doing when we added
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy in there under
 
02:48:39.070 --> 02:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
under under adequacy under adequacy but
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
then also went to studies to explain how
 
02:48:45.070 --> 02:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
that may occur you might embed it in a
 
02:48:47.469 --> 02:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
subject area like economics or you may
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
have it a separate course that's what
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with studies now is
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
try to further Define how some of that
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
works using that to tease it out as ex
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
rather than loading it all up
 
02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
inadequacy okay good thank you
 
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I don't think there's going
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be a whole lot more discussion on
 
02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
this particular area right now we ought
 
02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
to jump to the next bill and we probably
 
02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
get on that one
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
and and uh then we'll have a couple
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
which will take a short break for lunch
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
and then come back and get the other
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
other two hammered in uh we should be
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
out here by I would think today by
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
1:30 the next bill is
 
02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.229 --> 02:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
147 this is the bill dealing with
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council there for special
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
education and the membership
 
02:49:51.550 --> 02:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
and I've seen so many amendments to that
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
right now I don't know where I am on
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
that I thought represent B bony she's
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
not here today because of illness but
 
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
going to work on that a little bit uh
 
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.990 align:start position:0%
going to work on that a little bit uh
for

02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:05.870 --> 02:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
us I believe representative B bonies is
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
the one that came from representative
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
Tanner okay they worked on
 
02:50:10.319 --> 02:50:13.630 align:start position:0%
Tanner okay they worked on
together

02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay do you do you have the number of
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
that just yes um is
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
2363 yes 2363 H yes did you get a copy
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
of that that was handed
 
02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:30.309 align:start position:0%
of that that was handed
out

02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:50:30.319 --> 02:50:32.229 align:start position:0%
out
no

02:50:32.229 --> 02:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
Lind are there more copies of that
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
2363 there are some up there Jan's going
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that this
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
amendment was done in conjunction with
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative katab who had a lot of
 
02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
input the new chair of the um Sac that
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
was elected at the last meeting um many
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
parents who called and many of the other
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who are on this so this was
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
really a collaborative effort of many
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
together did you work with represent
 
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner in this represent Cornell
 
02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat we had we had a zoom and we and
 
02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
we did talk about it also with
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden um
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and representative
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
bbon did the bulk of
 
02:51:52.950 --> 02:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
the work okay we we've we've had this
 
02:51:54.910 --> 02:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
discussion then we know that there have
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be a majority of parents on there
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or children with
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and in looking at other
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
states uh they've been able to manage
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
that with fewer people uh on this
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
Council you're recommending now there be
 
02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
21 individuals with disabilities app
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
parents of children with disabilities
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
governor and then all the others how
 
02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
many total people are now on this
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
Council as proposed in this amendment
 
02:52:27.309 --> 02:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm total I'm actually not sure
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
but a number of the people that are on
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
it are in federal regulations that have
 
02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
to be on it um so that's why some of
 
02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
them are on it and I believe part of the
 
02:52:40.510 --> 02:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
problem in the past few years is with
 
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
the number of parents or individuals
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
with disabilities not being on it was
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been appointed by the
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
governor so there were a number of
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
openings for a couple of years that
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
never got appointed
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
um I I know it's a lot of people
 
02:53:02.229 --> 02:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
but yes I I counted I counted 40
 
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
40 is that a workable
 
02:53:09.710 --> 02:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
group I I don't think this number is any
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
more or less than what it's always been
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
and up until the past few years I think
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
they all found it workable and and think
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
they accomplished
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
stuff why is it that other
 
02:53:29.550 --> 02:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
states have half this number of people
 
02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
on there they don't have all these other
 
02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
categories on there as well so if you
 
02:53:36.030 --> 02:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
have lesser of those categories you're
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
not going to have as many parents
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
because you won't you still you will
 
02:53:40.670 --> 02:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
majority but it it seems to me that
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
every time
 
02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
we add something down below you got to
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
add another parent
 
02:53:50.750 --> 02:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
on it's
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
like when's where is it going to
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
stop I'm I'm gonna just invite one
 
02:54:01.229 --> 02:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
person up here uh Lisa B Bodwin has been
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
past president of the the the
 
02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
organization we're talking about here
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
and Lisa do you have any comments as a
 
02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
past president of that parent advisory
 
02:54:15.229 --> 02:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
Council uh there must be some history or
 
02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
have yes you do thank you for the record
 
02:54:26.190 --> 02:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Lisa Bodwin I served as chair
 
02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire State advisory
 
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
committee on the education of students
 
02:54:32.349 --> 02:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
with disabilities for four years and I
 
02:54:34.229 --> 02:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
was on the committee for
 
02:54:38.830 --> 02:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
six um I do believe that when you add
 
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
specific categories specific delineated
 
02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
categories at the bottom um then you do
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to add numbers of parents I think
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
that I would I would want a chance to
 
02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
reflect and get back on you but um a a
 
02:54:58.349 --> 02:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
committee of 40 is a bit unmanageable
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
and I can share with you some of my
 
02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
experiences um not only related to the
 
02:55:08.349 --> 02:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
the the size of the committee but other
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
issues um there was a period of time for
 
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
over 2 years when the governor did not
 
02:55:18.389 --> 02:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
either appoint or
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
reappoint um new members or existing
 
02:55:24.750 --> 02:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
members on the sac committee most of
 
02:55:28.030 --> 02:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
those were parent Representatives which
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
made doing business very very difficult
 
02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
um so we definitely want parents to
 
02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
engage uh it's critical I am a parent of
 
02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
a young man with Down Syndrome so I
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of providing
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
um guidance and recommendations to the
 
02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner on the endet needs of
 
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities um as someone
 
02:55:54.349 --> 02:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
who has been through the rigorous
 
02:55:58.830 --> 02:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
process of of um dealing with an IEP
 
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
team um I would say that I would like to
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
discuss for a moment um the importance
 
02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
of having both the disability rights
 
02:56:11.469 --> 02:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
Center and the parent information center
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
included on this list regardless of the
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
number of parent
 
02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives that you fundamentally
 
02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
end up with as a number making sure that
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
parents of students with disabilities or
 
02:56:26.429 --> 02:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities remain in the
 
02:56:29.550 --> 02:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
majority regardless of who else you cut
 
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
off I just wanted to provide some
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
commentary on why it's so important to
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
retain the DRC and pick is it okay if I
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
use those acronyms sure and Sack okay
 
02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
great so pick and the disabil ility
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
rights Center are and were during my
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
time a critically important part of the
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
duties of New Hampshire Sac each of
 
02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
these organizations hears from parents
 
02:56:56.429 --> 02:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
of students with disabilities from
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
across our beautiful Granite
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
State every day every week they hear
 
02:57:04.750 --> 02:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
from parents whether it's Coos County or
 
02:57:08.670 --> 02:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
marac County these organizations share
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
with sack the experience of students
 
02:57:13.469 --> 02:57:13.479 align:start position:0%
with disabilities from a wide range of
 
02:57:13.479 --> 02:57:14.670 align:start position:0%
with disabilities from a wide range of
disabili

02:57:14.670 --> 02:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
disabili
 
02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
and age groups which means that in those
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
moments when
 
02:57:22.349 --> 02:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
parents don't get their reappointment or
 
02:57:24.910 --> 02:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
their appointment or they have a sick
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
child or they have to parent because the
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
sack meets from 4:30 to
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
7: that by State Statute there is still
 
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
representation by the seated members
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
from pack and DRC of students with
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities because each of those
 
02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
organizations their missions are in in
 
02:57:48.469 --> 02:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
fact to serve the disability community
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
and those professionals have knowledge
 
02:57:52.319 --> 02:57:53.870 align:start position:0%
and those professionals have knowledge
of

02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
Ida individuals with disabilities
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Education Act the 504 plans all of the
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
state law and regulation that we add on
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the floor which is
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
Ida so whether we are considering um the
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
the in critical need of having a broad
 
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
representation of of what students with
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities experience as as it relates
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
to their unmet needs or whether it's
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
just simply getting guidance during a
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
Sac Committee hearing most parents don't
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
take a deep dive into Ida
 
02:58:34.469 --> 02:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
504s um and state regs I mean they're
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
broadly Familiar of course because
 
02:58:38.229 --> 02:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
parents of students with disabilities
 
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
have to be but if we are there to
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
provide guidance and issue
 
02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the UNM needs of
 
02:58:46.670 --> 02:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
students to the commissioner we cannot
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
get bogged down during a Committee
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
hearing because we don't happen to have
 
02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:52.229 align:start position:0%
hearing because we don't happen to have
perfectly

02:58:52.229 --> 02:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
memorized timelines on IEP processes or
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
federal ieda
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
statutes um I'm almost done with my
 
02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.469 align:start position:0%
statutes um I'm almost done with my
formal

02:59:07.469 --> 02:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
formal
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
um so they provide appropriate relevant
 
02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
guidance leaving members unog down by
 
02:59:16.710 --> 02:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
those by that knowledge
 
02:59:16.720 --> 02:59:19.389 align:start position:0%
those by that knowledge
base

02:59:19.389 --> 02:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
base
 
02:59:22.229 --> 02:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
um and in those moments when parents
 
02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
can't be present they definitely act as
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
a voice um I cannot stress that enough
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
um they don't take up seats from parents
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
but when parents can't be there it
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
representation and I also um have heard
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
that um this uh work group has not heard
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
much from parents who support the uh
 
02:59:55.870 --> 02:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
presence of pick and DRC on the sack um
 
03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult um to reach parents
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
um neither Pick Nor the DRC engage in
 
03:00:07.150 --> 03:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
lobbying um they don't teach parents to
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
Lobby that's not their function um pick
 
03:00:13.830 --> 03:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
is very very strong in particular on not
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
encouraging parents um to support their
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
work um and this is not an easy time of
 
03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
year to provide information on on the
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
idea that pick and DRC might be removed
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
from sack so if you're not hearing from
 
03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
parents um they're parenting and this is
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
not an issue um that that either Pi or
 
03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
DRC can can put out it's it's not their
 
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's not part of their mandates so
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
um I can try to reach out and make sure
 
03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you hear from dozens of parents who
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
would support this but I'll I hope that
 
03:00:56.229 --> 03:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
my um previous leadership at Sac has
 
03:00:58.830 --> 03:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
helped to illuminate why it's so
 
03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
important to have those Representatives
 
03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
on the committee thank you very much
 
03:01:03.399 --> 03:01:04.469 align:start position:0%
on the committee thank you very much
represent

03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:01:07.229 --> 03:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
dry thank you in the interest of maybe
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of people on there
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
are there any of those positions that
 
03:01:14.389 --> 03:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
could be non- voting members that would
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
show up at the table and be able to put
 
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
give input but not necessarily have to
 
03:01:19.950 --> 03:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
be a voting
 
03:01:22.710 --> 03:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
member uh that's an excellent question
 
03:01:25.550 --> 03:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
and and in order for me to answer that
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
for you I would have to think about it
 
03:01:30.349 --> 03:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
and get back to this work group on which
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
um which of the
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
representatives um would be best served
 
03:01:38.670 --> 03:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
just simply providing information and
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
being non voting in terms of putting
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
them in technical advisor roles to the
 
03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee that's a great
 
03:01:50.030 --> 03:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
idea would that be appropriate for I get
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
you in second art would that be a a a
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
good way of uh having the representative
 
03:01:57.630 --> 03:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
from the disability rights Center or the
 
03:01:59.429 --> 03:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
parent information center there as
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
technical support in your presentation
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
to us just now you talked about they
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
give us support right and
 
03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
information I in my opinion I believe
 
03:02:13.710 --> 03:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
that because of the direct the amount of
 
03:02:16.349 --> 03:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
direct contact that they have with
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
families the kinds of training advice
 
03:02:22.269 --> 03:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
and legal support that each of these uh
 
03:02:24.670 --> 03:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
pick doesn't provide legal I'm I'm
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
meshing together for the purposes of
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
expediency you know they they do legal
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
support they provide problem solving for
 
03:02:35.590 --> 03:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
IEP team meetings that get stuck they
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
they pick Teach as parents how to deal
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
um with being a good partner in the IEP
 
03:02:44.910 --> 03:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
process um they have such a vast direct
 
03:02:46.750 --> 03:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
experience with what students with
 
03:02:49.070 --> 03:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities face I think it is
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate given their direct contact
 
03:02:55.309 --> 03:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
with families and students that they
 
03:02:59.110 --> 03:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
should have a voting um a voting seat
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very represent Ellison thank
 
03:03:04.349 --> 03:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you for being here this is a
 
03:03:07.469 --> 03:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
question I guess to Patty and to Rick I
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
mean we're what's what's rolling around
 
03:03:14.030 --> 03:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind here is what requirement are
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
there for having people from
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
institutions on this group now Patty
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
you're real clear that somebody's gone
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
through this and you and Linda and it
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
requires 20 given this list Rick is
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
saying there's states that have must
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
have much less than 20 because the total
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
group is smaller so if you had 10 you'd
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
only have to have 11 parents it's not
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
unclear to me what the federal

the legislature in previous
 
03:04:31.389 --> 03:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
years so are there any uh further
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions for Elise at this this time I
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
I do have one one or two recommendations
 
03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.750 align:start position:0%
I do have one one or two recommendations
from

03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
um representative Tanner's amendment I
 
03:04:44.349 --> 03:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
would I would recommend
 
03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the representative from DHHS be a
 
03:04:50.030 --> 03:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
technical adviser um in the six years
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
that I was on sack despite showing up at
 
03:04:54.190 --> 03:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
the Brown building and sending multiple
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
emails to the commissioner requesting
 
03:04:59.710 --> 03:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
that they um ensure that a
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative show up um HHS has not um
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
sent a representative to sack in it in
 
03:05:10.750 --> 03:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
at least the last seven years that I am
 
03:05:14.229 --> 03:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
aware of um and I would
 
03:05:14.239 --> 03:05:15.910 align:start position:0%
aware of um and I would
um

03:05:15.910 --> 03:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:18.269 --> 03:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
also um
 
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:24.399 --> 03:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
H

03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
H
 
03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:29.190 align:start position:0%
H
are

03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:05:33.870 --> 03:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
and and also H those would be technical
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
I would recommend right off the bat that
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
they be technical non- voting
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
members go if if I could just interject
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
um in terms of all are um one of the
 
03:05:47.070 --> 03:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
federal requirements is a representative
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
from the State Child Welfare agency
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for foster care
 
03:05:55.229 --> 03:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
okay and so clarification on that if
 
03:05:56.830 --> 03:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's a federal requirement do they have
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be a voting member I I am unaware of
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like I can get back to the
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
work group on
 
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
work group on
that

03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:06:09.070 --> 03:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:06:09.080 --> 03:06:12.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
y

03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay in your experience uh as as chair
 
03:06:17.349 --> 03:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
organization uh what about item d one
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
represented vocational Community or
 
03:06:21.720 --> 03:06:23.429 align:start position:0%
represented vocational Community or
business

03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
organization um that has always been a
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
tricky spot to fill and in my time my
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
six years there was not much
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
participation from that individual when
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:06:40.349 --> 03:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
present um my understanding of the
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
history and of of sack is that
 
03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
this these roles were expanded to try to
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate as um nuanced and detailed
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
approach to being able to examine the
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
unmet needs of students with
 
03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities and in in seeking detailed
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
representation for individuals with
 
03:07:06.229 --> 03:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities up to the age of 21 and now
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
of course in New Hampshire it's 22 that
 
03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
is where all of this um specificity has
 
03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:14.269 align:start position:0%
is where all of this um specificity has
arisen

03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
arisen
 
03:07:17.670 --> 03:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
from it's it's amazing that when I read
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
the other states they say ages 3 through
 
03:07:27.070 --> 03:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
26 and then they also have uh statutory
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
language where the parent or the person
 
03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be attending can't come
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
today because I have a parent teacher
 
03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
conference or some other rationale they
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
can designate a
 
03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
substitute that's that is a that is a
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful and most the states I looked
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
at the other evening when I was trying
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
to figure this stuff out have that
 
03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
ability for to have a substitute acting
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
on your behalf that is a voting person
 
03:07:57.229 --> 03:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
at the time that they're there yes
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
additionally um there are parents in the
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
North Country I I know three parents
 
03:08:04.510 --> 03:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
from the North Country who would have
 
03:08:05.790 --> 03:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
loved to have served on the New
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sack but you can only um you
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
have you must be in person to vote um
 
03:08:14.990 --> 03:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
however I would like to inform this work
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
group that the quality
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
Council of the developmental disability
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
system now has permission for um Zoom
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
participation and the ability to vote if
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're virtual in part because that is
 
03:08:33.910 --> 03:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
an accommodation for people with
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities who who have transportation
 
03:08:40.269 --> 03:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
challenges and so a real barrier that
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
this work group might want to consider
 
03:08:46.229 --> 03:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
is is mandating that you must be in
 
03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
person in conquered when you are a
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
parent of a kiddo with a disability
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
between 4:30 and 7 and that you cannot
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
um have a have your vote count unless
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're in person that really Pro that's
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
a barrier
 
03:09:03.950 --> 03:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
for families with disabilities so um if
 
03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:04.830 align:start position:0%
for families with disabilities so um if
you

03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
could uh address that and resolve that
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
barrier um we would struggle less to get
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
um moms and dads involved that's a good
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
point represent Cornell and I could be
 
03:09:20.590 --> 03:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
making this up but I I thought that it
 
03:09:22.590 --> 03:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
got changed and as long as there was a
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
quorum you could vote over as long as
 
03:09:27.710 --> 03:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's a quorum in person in person
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
you okay any
 
03:09:40.030 --> 03:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
much Al righty uh we have that that
 
03:09:45.550 --> 03:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
sheet now which identifies everything in
 
03:09:49.150 --> 03:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
federal law that we have to
 
03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
federal law that we have to
have

03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh ages birth through
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
26 so now they got it down to Birth has
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
PR

03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are some states that have that and
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned when we had wasn't a
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
doe that mentioned that to us at the
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
last meeting you could count if you're
 
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
there as a person from doe but if you
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
also have a child that's you could be
 
03:10:32.790 --> 03:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
also counted as a parent I I think the
 
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
parents didn't like that that's right
 
03:10:37.950 --> 03:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so the parents are going to
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
majority it's pretty hard though to say
 
03:10:46.030 --> 03:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm not a
 
03:10:49.630 --> 03:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
parent and my child's in a wheelchair
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
03:10:54.590 --> 03:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
understand I think that's why some
 
03:10:56.389 --> 03:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
states have gone the other
 
03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
way represent cordelli yeah I just I
 
03:11:03.630 --> 03:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
think that we've heard several hours on
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
on this this one bill um about
 
03:11:10.110 --> 03:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
membership of a council um and my
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that you know on the 13th
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
we look at the Amendments that we have
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
vote represent
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
leas yes I'm I'm trying to understand
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
could you explain why two individuals
 
03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
could you explain why two individuals
with

03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:11:32.830 --> 03:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
k

03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
because it's the same as 21 individuals
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or parents of children
 
03:11:51.790 --> 03:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
with disabilities appointed by the
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
yeah is there any more disc uh just
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
quickly I you know I ran the list here
 
03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
of required Representatives I come up
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
with 14 and this gets into wordsmithing
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
because one says a representative from
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
and then there are a number that say
 
03:12:19.950 --> 03:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives which means I guess that
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
means two but counting all those it came
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
at least under the federal requirements
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
for a I will use agency people that's
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
not correct but that's what I'm picking
 
03:12:33.790 --> 03:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
up 14 required people to be on this
 
03:12:37.070 --> 03:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
thing and then the question is is that
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
is that the minimum is that what's
 
03:12:43.630 --> 03:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
required uh and we're at 20 now based on
 
03:12:46.910 --> 03:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
the based on what we've got anything in
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
between you know drops that total number
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
down and I'm I'm not really interested
 
03:12:55.950 --> 03:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
in uh sort of lowering the membership
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of people if it works it works it
 
03:13:01.469 --> 03:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
can work at 44 it can work at 40 but if
 
03:13:03.990 --> 03:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is it's too large we
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
can get it to 25 or
 
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
26 maybe the chances are works better so
 
03:13:11.790 --> 03:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
I just think we really need to figure
 
03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
out what's required under the federal
 
03:13:17.710 --> 03:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
law and then what have we added in in
 
03:13:20.190 --> 03:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
legislation or everything for a while
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
20 I I think that's good point you know
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
what's required there we got that now
 
03:13:35.550 --> 03:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
let's go on and add to it but keeping in
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
mind there's going to have to be a
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
majority of parents yeah and so be very
 
03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
careful that we don't get duplication in
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
an administ rators you know are we going
 
03:13:46.110 --> 03:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
to have a the administrator of the
 
03:13:48.190 --> 03:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
Special Education Association or you
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
know the representative which is an
 
03:13:51.550 --> 03:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
administrator are we going to have other
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
types of Administrators on there or is
 
03:13:54.960 --> 03:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
types of Administrators on there or is
one

03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:00.670 --> 03:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
enough I don't know I sat on it for a
 
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
while myself and there are so many
 
03:14:04.030 --> 03:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
room uh it it was you know tough it was
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
tough It's hard to get business done
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so what are we going to do here
 
03:14:18.190 --> 03:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
because we are running out of time yeah
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
so you know a lot of times there's a lot
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
of people in this room too but there's
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
20 people around the table and we get
 
03:14:28.269 --> 03:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
advice and input and technical support
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
from people who are not necessarily
 
03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education committee
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
is that a way that this um committee
 
03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
could could operate uh with regards to
 
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
for instance the the the the DHHS
 
03:14:49.389 --> 03:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
staff um you know somebody
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
from uh business organization conserved
 
03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
with transition Services things like
 
03:14:58.030 --> 03:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
that could could they be non could could
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
they help out the committee um as being
 
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
non-members of the committee but but
 
03:15:08.670 --> 03:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
being very important guests to be in the
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
meetings did I mean do these do these
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
committee meetings have hearings and
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
03:15:21.550 --> 03:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
non-members of each yeah each meeting
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
has an agenda um certainly can have
 
03:15:25.950 --> 03:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
invited guests we have invited guests
 
03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
all the time so uh you know I don't see
 
03:15:30.990 --> 03:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
any problem with invited guests to a
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
meeting but would that be a a way of you
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
know would that be a a
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
helpful disposition to get down to what
 
03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.710 --> 03:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
suggested I think you need one of those
 
03:15:48.510 --> 03:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
members which were talking you know I
 
03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
look at the advisory Council for CTE we
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
have a department person on board that
 
03:15:57.550 --> 03:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
sets the agendas does the scheduling
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
does the
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
communicating really keeps us on course
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's Jeff
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
beard um there needs to be such a person
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
for this so that you're going to have
 
03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
your meetings over at Granite State in
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
the conference room and you're agendas
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to walk in the agendas are
 
03:16:16.830 --> 03:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
already completed you the chair works
 
03:16:20.110 --> 03:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
with that person setting up the agenda
 
03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that will work uh so the next
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
step for us would be to okay we know we
 
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
have the required by fed law here or or
 
03:16:32.670 --> 03:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
the the regulation here then then let's
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
try and find out who else was really
 
03:16:37.229 --> 03:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
needed there as a voting member and what
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
kind what of all these who could be a
 
03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
technical support person I I think we
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful with the
 
03:16:45.389 --> 03:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
technical support and taking over CU I
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
think one of the complaints from the
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
parents was feeling intimidated and
 
03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
feeling um that they weren't in control
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the meetings that the that the
 
03:16:57.309 --> 03:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
officials or the people
 
03:16:58.990 --> 03:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
representing they that they were
 
03:17:01.189 --> 03:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
intimidated by them and didn't feel that
 
03:17:03.309 --> 03:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
they had as much say so I think the
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
technical support and getting all the
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
help and having it be set up and and you
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
know help from the Department of Ed but
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
I I think the like the chair that was
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
elected needs to be the one that's in
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
charge I I as I recall the technical
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
support was more in terms of um since we
 
03:17:27.990 --> 03:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
have zoom access um for these meetings
 
03:17:31.070 --> 03:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
to have uh make sure that the uh
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
internet availability and zoom access is
 
03:17:37.950 --> 03:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.030 --> 03:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
basis that should be something we can
 
03:17:43.630 --> 03:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
work out fairly easily another technical
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
question on the amendment um on on
 
03:17:52.269 --> 03:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh make sure I find it on page
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
two Roman 6 does does that so down at
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom line 22 is that addressing
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
what representative Myer was suggesting
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
that would that um that that this
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
committee needs some
 
03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
additional uh support from the
 
03:18:13.750 --> 03:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
Department uh maybe even the department
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
needing some funding to make sure that
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
that support happens is that sufficient
 
03:18:26.189 --> 03:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.199 --> 03:18:31.229 align:start position:0%
 
concern

03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
yeah well on a lot of our committees
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
which we've had before like uh if on
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
some of the trustees we've always had
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
non- voting member it says it um in the
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh committee for Teacher shortage uh we
 
03:18:49.990 --> 03:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
had uh Steve applebe technical support
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
that was written in the law underneath
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
the list of members although he wasn't a
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
voting member he was there for technical
 
03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
support well in in this case I'm not
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
talking about technical support um from
 
03:19:03.389 --> 03:19:03.399 align:start position:0%
for information but technical support
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
for the logistics and um preparation of
 
03:19:10.030 --> 03:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
the of the meeting because I uh I think
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
that was a concern that had come out
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the internet worked or
 
03:19:16.910 --> 03:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes something wouldn't uh you know
 
03:19:19.389 --> 03:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be working properly but does
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
this direct the department to to address
 
03:19:25.950 --> 03:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
those concerns to make it easier for the
 
03:19:28.750 --> 03:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
um for the chair yeah to focus on the
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
meeting and not focus on the making sure
 
03:19:34.269 --> 03:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
that the desks are lined up well I would
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that this would do it okay yeah I
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that as long as it's technical
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
support that's well
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
um either defined or the intent is clear
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
um rather than having someone from the
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
Department taking minutes and things
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
like that um you know that would be my
 
03:19:53.560 --> 03:19:56.070 align:start position:0%
like that um you know that would be my
concern

03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
represent

03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:42.429 --> 03:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
as to that I think it's it's hard enough
 
03:20:44.309 --> 03:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
to get people to go but I've been told
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
like the superintendent of the um County
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections if they're not voting it's
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
hours of their time night they're not
 
03:20:58.229 --> 03:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:01.389 --> 03:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
yeah how important is it for those that
 
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
have been on this to be there as a
 
03:21:07.590 --> 03:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative do they look to the
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
legislature for guidance or
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
support speaking for myself in my time I
 
03:21:15.790 --> 03:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if they look to the
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
legislators for uh support or guidance
 
03:21:22.630 --> 03:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
um in some cases that might not be a
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
good idea um but uh um certainly when
 
03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
they're talking about um uh proposed
 
03:21:33.550 --> 03:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
rules or proposed educa uh proposed
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um one of their duties is to
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
provide uh feedback to the
 
03:21:42.429 --> 03:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh so having someone who
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
can uh discuss what uh legislation is
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
pending um is I I think a good
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
thing so that they have the ability to
 
03:21:54.990 --> 03:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
give feedback to the
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner but do we need as many I
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
mean do we need a senator do we need two
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives yeah do two
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
representatives and take out the senator
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
could does it
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
say um
 
03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
I think in the past we did have Senators
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
um um attending I I remember Senator
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
Reagan to being attend uh in attendance
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
quite often at meetings um and I believe
 
03:22:28.590 --> 03:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.469 --> 03:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
Ward yes Senator Khan as well right yeah
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't you need one representative
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
and one Senator just so you have the
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
information coming from and going to the
 
03:22:43.229 --> 03:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
two separate bodies I because you may
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
being that's coming from the Senate that
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives don't know
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
about yet so rather than two
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
representatives in one Senator you can
 
03:22:58.349 --> 03:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
have one representative in one Senator
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
it would cut down but you would still
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
have that information going back and
 
03:23:04.510 --> 03:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
forth to each
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
body just a
 
03:23:09.870 --> 03:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
thought okay let's quickly just take
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
well five more minutes at 12:30 we're
 
03:23:14.670 --> 03:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to take a lunch break but um let's
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
walk through this thing skip over uh 2A
 
03:23:20.910 --> 03:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
which is the number of parents we can
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
figure that out based upon the number of
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
others we can just give the majority do
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
we need on line 10 B two members of the
 
03:23:33.110 --> 03:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
one yeah if we put in the Clause that um
 
03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
Lisa kindly recommended permission to
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
have a sub
 
03:23:45.910 --> 03:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have one rep and the rep if they
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
can't attend can make sure they have a
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
sub so everybody's in agreement that one
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
rep okay let's put a one there and get
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
on to the next one uh C uh two members
 
03:24:00.910 --> 03:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the Senate one Senator is that good
 
03:24:04.269 --> 03:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we already that
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
d uh one representative of vocational
 
03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
Community they haven't been there
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:16.269 align:start position:0%
 
scratch

03:24:16.269 --> 03:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:21.429 --> 03:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.590 --> 03:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's right that's what they
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
have so we that's
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
required okay next one e one State
 
03:24:32.830 --> 03:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
education official from the Department
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
of Education appointed by the
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.309 --> 03:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
position talking about I I believe um in
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
the past it's U been the special
 
03:24:57.750 --> 03:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
education director so if we have one
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's doing McKinny vinto on the
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
homeless which is later on is that the
 
03:25:03.309 --> 03:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
same official they're from the
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
Education what is State education
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.269 --> 03:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
Education the Department of
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
Education this is where we're getting
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives so it means more than
 
03:25:38.910 --> 03:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.790 --> 03:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
way but see number five requir in the
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation there is also
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.429 --> 03:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
Q so that that person that comes from
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
doe could be the same
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
person so we leave q and we take out
 
03:26:04.750 --> 03:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
e because the Federal Law requires mckin
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
vento so we have specify yeah let's just
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
take out
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
e or unless and and that might be the
 
03:26:25.550 --> 03:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
person proba very helpful and tiido the
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
the the director in charge of
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
certification and lure is the one that
 
03:26:37.229 --> 03:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
came on as technical support to the
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
commission on teacher shortage that
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
person can also be that person that
 
03:26:44.189 --> 03:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
provides support but doesn't have to be
 
03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
member where you on
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
that well I'm I'm I'm saying leave e
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
there but as a non- voting
 
03:27:03.189 --> 03:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
member and would be the person who
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
provides that
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
support just like Jeff beard does for
 
03:27:10.319 --> 03:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
support just like Jeff beard does for
the

03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
CTE Council advisory Council these
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
meetings are public meetings right yeah
 
03:27:28.030 --> 03:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
members but if you want them there to do
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
that last partion here that was added on
 
03:27:34.830 --> 03:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom here
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.030 align:start position:0%
 
26

03:27:42.030 --> 03:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
26
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is a good way to get it just put
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
support to even non voting
 
03:27:54.070 --> 03:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
member majority
 
03:28:03.150 --> 03:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
counted

03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
counted
 
03:28:13.510 --> 03:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
many no no if they're not voting no they
 
03:28:15.189 --> 03:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be they're not a voting member
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:23.550 --> 03:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
count well you just put in parentheses
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
non- voting member that's what we used
 
03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
to do with the
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
member so if you label them Technic
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
technical support as opposed to members
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
then they don't count so just label them
 
03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:49.030 align:start position:0%
then they don't count so just label them
technical

03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
technical
 
03:28:49.040 --> 03:28:57.710 align:start position:0%
technical
support

03:28:57.710 --> 03:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
right but if it's not in statute they're
 
03:29:03.189 --> 03:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to say I'm not coming now if it's
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
in statute they got to be
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
support

03:29:15.070 --> 03:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.229 --> 03:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
people show
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
up we could take it off if you had if
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
you had located on the next page at the
 
03:29:26.670 --> 03:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
bottom there but uh by putting it here
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
you really identifying you're going to
 
03:29:35.950 --> 03:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:38.990 --> 03:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
present yes and that's it
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
says one state education official from
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education that would
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
be technical support or non voting
 
03:29:52.830 --> 03:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.389 --> 03:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
it let's put down right now technical
 
03:29:59.189 --> 03:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
support by that one so the E person who
 
03:30:03.189 --> 03:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
currently comes does not almost always
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
abstains so they're not really voting
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
anyways so the eers will just be
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
technical support right yeah okay let's
 
03:30:13.189 --> 03:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
move on down
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
f so that's the
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
new that's what everybody's most people
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
are saying we
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
need Okay so let's just keep
 
03:30:33.309 --> 03:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
it uh next one G two teachers one of
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
whom shall be a special education
 
03:30:36.830 --> 03:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
teacher appointed by the
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
governor I wonder if that should just be
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:48.189 --> 03:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
03:30:52.590 --> 03:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
plural that this Federal thing the
 
03:30:55.389 --> 03:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
Preble says they'll be made up of
 
03:30:58.349 --> 03:30:58.359 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in in order to
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
agree with that theyve made everything
 
03:31:03.429 --> 03:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
plural all the way through I don't think
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
that requires multiple of all these
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
things I think it's just the
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:15.910 align:start position:0%
things I think it's just the
grammar

03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
is any objection to making it one
 
03:31:21.870 --> 03:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
teacher okay one
 
03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
yeah why do we have to even say you say
 
03:31:57.790 --> 03:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
teacher could be a retired
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
teacher okay so you want to have one
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
special education credential teacher I
 
03:32:17.469 --> 03:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
H this is where we discussed earlier
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
today the Health and Human Services they
 
03:32:28.720 --> 03:32:30.830 align:start position:0%
today the Health and Human Services they
never

03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
never
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
regulation one
 
03:32:39.840 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
regulation one
one

03:33:03.720 --> 03:33:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.730 --> 03:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:50.349 align:start position:0%
 
be

03:33:50.349 --> 03:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
are we assuming that federal law when
 
03:33:57.189 --> 03:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
they Define the membership that all of
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
those categories need to be voting
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
members or can we interpret that with
 
03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
respect to the input we just got a bit
 
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
ago that the DHHS people don't come
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
anyway so they could be advised members
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
not voting
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
members I I think it's always been
 
03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted they're voting
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
members I'm getting
 
03:34:25.150 --> 03:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
creative nice try okay so are we keeping
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
H yes yeah
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh down to the disability rights
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
center doesn't require either of
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:45.229 align:start position:0%
center doesn't require either of
those

03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
so you want to keep those two areas
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody's yes on that even though
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
one has a lobbyist yes no no I'm
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
not I I heard the chair here today speak
 
03:35:05.710 --> 03:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.309 --> 03:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
lobbyist we had one sitting here at the
 
03:35:19.590 --> 03:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
regarding their status on they don't
 
03:35:29.070 --> 03:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
train or otherwise encourage families to
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
participate uh in in Civic engagement so
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.229 --> 03:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
whyc because the DRC as an organization
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do Outreach to
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.550 --> 03:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
the I don't think we should be not
 
03:36:14.189 --> 03:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
having them because one is registered as
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist we get information and input
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
from lobbyists for other organizations
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much every day and we screen out
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
what we agree or disagree
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
with those folks have particular
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:34.030 --> 03:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
population but they're lobbying for
 
03:36:36.269 --> 03:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
students and families with disabilities
 
03:36:37.870 --> 03:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
so I mean the re the thing that they're
 
03:36:40.189 --> 03:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
lobbying for is the committee that
 
03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
parent parents and families that the
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee is working to do things for so
 
03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:46.429 align:start position:0%
committee is working to do things for so
they're

03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
lobbying for what this
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
is they're not lobbying for for
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
themselves or and I think that's what
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
that um that's what they said was that
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
they they're they're lobbying for yeah
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
to making sure that their their
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
standards are being carried through in
 
03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:09.389 align:start position:0%
standards are being carried through in
in

03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:37:09.399 --> 03:37:11.189 align:start position:0%
in
legislation

03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:37:11.199 --> 03:37:12.469 align:start position:0%
legislation
represent

03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
cascaden not that I want to go back to a
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
but my thinking is that it's critical to
 
03:37:24.670 --> 03:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
have DRC and pick there as opposed to
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
senators and
 
03:37:28.870 --> 03:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
representatives what
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits the parent chair for example
 
03:37:35.389 --> 03:37:35.399 align:start position:0%
if the topic comes up of
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that one of those
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
organizations or the chair request a
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
member of the Senate education committee
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to come participate in that discussion
 
03:37:49.630 --> 03:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
at that meeting or a representative of
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
the education committee to go to that
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
meeting to have that discussion with
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
them without being named as members of
 
03:37:58.040 --> 03:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
them without being named as members of
the

03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:02.550 --> 03:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
committee and keeping those two
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
organizations who are responsible for
 
03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:06.790 align:start position:0%
organizations who are responsible for
parent

03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
advocacy and for following the laws I I
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
I mean just just contact a member of the
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
representatives to have that discussion
 
03:38:18.910 --> 03:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
I mean then you could eliminate
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
too so so you have these up there but
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
member

03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.189 --> 03:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
I has a
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair yeah I has a question
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
about let's when we're talking about
 
03:38:58.750 --> 03:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to manage 40 people in a
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee or what is the difference
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
between voting and non- voting really
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
those people are all in the room and
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
then it comes time to vote so you vote
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is in the 40 people
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
right that's right you can cut your
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
parent number
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
down see the more members you are if you
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
have 40 people there 21 of them are
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you can cut it down this non
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
voting you cut it down to 38 you can
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
probably cut down a little bit with the
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
probably cut down a little bit with the
parents

03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be tough to go from 40 to
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
20 right I mean what are you going to go
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
from 40 to
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
38 yeah thank you um so following
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
following up on that is does this do
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to do a report right at
 
03:39:59.070 --> 03:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
the end there's supposed to be so the
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
legislature

03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.910 --> 03:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I think you're going to
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
have to have an elected PE person there
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
at the meetings whether they're voting
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
or not if we leave them in we've cut it
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
down to 16 which is 32 people total 33
 
03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:25.150 align:start position:0%
down to 16 which is 32 people total 33
people

03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:40:27.070 --> 03:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
total how many people think we should
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
take the representative and Senator out
 
03:40:28.680 --> 03:40:30.110 align:start position:0%
take the representative and Senator out
of

03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:41.790 align:start position:0%
 
seven

03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:40:47.229 --> 03:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
one two three four yeah eight but
 
03:40:50.830 --> 03:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
the and that's how many here today 1 2 3
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
four five 6 7 8 11 12 13 oh there's a
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
majority people want to say Wipe Out
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
the personally I don't have any skin in
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
this game so that's
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
but C can we ask Lisa that's what I was
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
thinking did you find having
 
03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
representative or Senator useful on the
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.030 --> 03:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
useful and make anything can't move
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
anything forward um and and I I see it
 
03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
equally from both sides um when a me
 
03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
when members of the House and Senate are
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
present and they are present
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
consistently they also get to hear from
 
03:41:52.149 --> 03:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
the parents that's what I was thinking
 
03:41:54.189 --> 03:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
they get to hear about the issues and so
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
they are better informed about this
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
constituency which has a difficult time
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
gaining voice in the public Arena so I
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
see both you know and but the other side
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
of that is it can be part of the caucus
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility to say even though you're
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
not a voting member we we would like to
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
find someone who is going to
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
conscientiously attend these meetings
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
and be invested in this committee so
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
like I would have to think about this in
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
order to provide if you wanted my my
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
opinion but I just I can see it from
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
03:42:32.520 --> 03:42:38.950 align:start position:0%
both sides
usually

03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
represent you you want to say something
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
Ben U I'm not sure if you know it's
 
03:42:50.349 --> 03:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
quarter of one now I'm not sure if we're
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to reach a majority consensus um
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
by uh 2:00 um the way things are going
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
so can can
 
03:43:02.149 --> 03:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
we anyone put in any amendments they
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
want and we'll we'll vote on them on in
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
13th well we we're all the way down to
 
03:43:11.189 --> 03:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
the base here so we left one I and J
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
right um
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
L one administrator public
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
requ okay m one representative
 
03:43:29.950 --> 03:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
institution of higher education that
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
postsecondary

03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that's in law then okay let's move on
 
03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:47.950 align:start position:0%
so that's in law then okay let's move on
down

03:43:47.950 --> 03:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
then one representative a private school
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
approved for special education is that
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
required no required one representative
 
03:43:58.149 --> 03:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School appointed by the
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
governor that's required too
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.790 --> 03:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
eight so so we we could one of those out
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
or or we could say one representative of
 
03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
school or Andor Andor and just get one
 
03:44:22.880 --> 03:44:25.309 align:start position:0%
school or Andor Andor and just get one
of

03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
required and why were they both
 
03:44:33.359 --> 03:44:34.990 align:start position:0%
required and why were they both
required

03:44:34.990 --> 03:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
eight private schools and private
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools I mean this is going to
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
be the dry amendment that plural is on
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
everything here so we have one and or no
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
but it says but the Clause that refers
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the plural specifies two things this
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
one and this one and there's nobody that
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
right and and I would say with Charter
 
03:45:01.309 --> 03:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
Schools one issue we have faced uh
 
03:45:03.870 --> 03:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times the past few years is
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
who's providing the services to the
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
special needs child in the charter
 
03:45:10.030 --> 03:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
school that's been a big issue they're
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
very I think
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
both but very important I
 
03:45:18.269 --> 03:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
told oh one one individual representing
 
03:45:20.910 --> 03:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
with children with disposed
 
03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.269 --> 03:45:28.279 align:start position:0%
required right they're not recquired so
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
do you want to take that
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.800 --> 03:45:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
out

03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
p okay Corrections and one
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative that's two right
 
03:45:48.030 --> 03:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
required one represent from the
 
03:45:56.830 --> 03:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
period right one from each I I I think
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
each do in County Corrections do we have
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
yes sometimes and my superintendent said
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
he's very involved in it he likes going
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the meetings and they do and he wants
 
03:46:20.910 --> 03:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
to work with them to get their education
 
03:46:24.910 --> 03:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
so my my former superintendent um used
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
to go to the meetings because he likes
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
meetings mine said he would rather be
 
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
home with his family but when you're
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with these young kids which are
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
in the County correctional facilities
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of them have bys you have to chase
 
03:46:43.229 --> 03:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
down the district that they're from so
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
the superintendant do get engaged or
 
03:46:54.360 --> 03:46:54.370 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.370 --> 03:46:58.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
volunteering so you know what are they
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to do to us if we have one
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
representative from the County
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility well it doesn't
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
say County and
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
state and 11 says representatives from
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
the state Juvenile and adult corrections
 
03:47:21.950 --> 03:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
agencies so it's Juvenile and adult that
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
County so Alicia which one were we going
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%

03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
out well they're both in there yeah we
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
you mean is depending upon State and
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
County um instead of putting State and
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
County why don't we just put it the way
 
03:47:46.149 --> 03:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
it is it says state representatives from
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%

11 okay we can put number 11 in the way
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%

03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
there for
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
the require for the ones we just went
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
through and agreed then we can figure
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.269 --> 03:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
less one
 
03:48:52.279 --> 03:48:55.149 align:start position:0%
less one
two

03:48:55.149 --> 03:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
parents six seven
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
8 9 10 11 12
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
you could probably elim eliminate the
 
03:49:14.910 --> 03:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and keep the
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
house the Senate is going to agree yeah
 
03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
16 I still come up with
 
03:49:24.990 --> 03:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
16 because some of those are
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
to because
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
um p is two one for one
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
one okay with the senator and the
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative 16 is that the total 16
 
03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:43.429 align:start position:0%
representative 16 is that the total 16
yes

03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
16 16 one of them has two different um
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
p p has two different ones one that's
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
or Alicia's G do the amendment Alicia
 
03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:04.600 align:start position:0%

hour we do 354 next I think I've got
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
solution to that yeah okay
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we have on
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
the which is Apple be's shity Bond that
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
155 will wipe out real quick
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just knocking out the shy
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
Bond stuff and then we're good my
 
03:50:49.149 --> 03:50:49.159 align:start position:0%

this

04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
we have several bills still to do today
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
354 is one of them which deals with uh
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School uh building

docka Today is let's see 155
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
155 and that that one deals with the
 
04:39:24.240 --> 04:39:25.629 align:start position:0%
155 and that that one deals with the
higher

04:39:25.629 --> 04:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
education and the indemnification for
 
04:39:28.240 --> 04:39:29.109 align:start position:0%
education and the indemnification for
private

postsecondary uh
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
organizations so let's get back to 354

organizations so let's get back to 354
here

here
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
um I've handed out a
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment which was
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
23088 which we had at the last uh
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%

for the amendment I can go
 
04:40:10.190 --> 04:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
um it it was
 
04:40:12.958 --> 04:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
um it it was
238

04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
238
 
04:40:14.560 --> 04:40:16.708 align:start position:0%
238
2308

04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
2308
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
H and if you take the sheet that I
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
handed out I haven't change some of the
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
terminology at top it says changes only
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
on page one I'll show you where the
 
04:40:25.760 --> 04:40:27.708 align:start position:0%
on page one I'll show you where the
changes

04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
are um you can see on page one where
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2B has been eliminated
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
that's a paragraph which was requiring a
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
charter school to put up a shy
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
bond in order to get and receive Charter
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
School building
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
Aid and the other change was on 2A just
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
above it where we have in the event of a
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary or involuntary
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
disillusion then on page two on line
 
04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
eight and
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
nine uh there was no need to have that
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
sentence in there um and that was a
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
result of Correspondence I received from
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
the Department from uh Amy Clark who is
 
04:41:13.798 --> 04:41:15.350 align:start position:0%
the Department from uh Amy Clark who is
here

04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
today and the other change on this
 
04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is on the back page on page
 
04:41:25.310 --> 04:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
six which is also underlined the
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
underlined areas that the changed
 
04:41:27.520 --> 04:41:29.628 align:start position:0%
underlined areas that the changed
areas

04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
um under the Charter Public School
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
establishment RSA 194b 32
 
04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
Z it currently Says Z Provisions for
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
dissolution of the Charter Public School
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
including disposition of assets or
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
amendment of its program plan this adds
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
in a Charter Public School may not be
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
eligible for a State Building aid grant
 
04:41:54.750 --> 04:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
until the State Board of Education has
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
plan so what this basically the bill
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
that is is introduced by
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:09.320 --> 04:42:10.948 align:start position:0%
 
Moody

04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
Moody
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
um to allow charter schools to receive
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
School building Aid so that's what this
 
04:42:18.718 --> 04:42:20.430 align:start position:0%
School building Aid so that's what this
basically

04:42:20.430 --> 04:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
does and the other change on the
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
backside which was discussed at the last
 
04:42:28.830 --> 04:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
one deals with the records coming out of
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
a chartered public school which is going
 
04:42:33.310 --> 04:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
through the disillusionment process it
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
says where those students records must
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
be maintained or sent to as a result of
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
the closure and we discussed that the
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussion repr luno thanks very much Mr
 
04:42:54.990 --> 04:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
chair and um and I know we had a little
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
bit of a discussion I think last
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday um you and I did with with
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
respect to to the concern around
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
um what happens to assets on dissolution
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
and um and well I think this is a a a
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
step forward with it particularly the
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
part in section
 
04:43:15.240 --> 04:43:17.628 align:start position:0%
part in section
five

04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm I'm thinking that that the
 
04:43:24.910 --> 04:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
um that the language isn't going far
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
enough to lay
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
out what
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
um what would be required elements or
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
required um components of of that
 
04:43:35.040 --> 04:43:36.430 align:start position:0%
required um components of of that
dissolution

04:43:36.430 --> 04:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
04:43:39.390 --> 04:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
plan you know some some sort of
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
objective requirements rather than
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to sort of a subjective
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
assessment by the state
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
board that's sort of my my feeling on
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
what's in five
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
um would it could would it be
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
clarified to to do it here verse should
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
it be done through Ru making by the
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
department working with the State Board
 
04:44:07.948 --> 04:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
as to other words put in a sentence you
 
04:44:10.990 --> 04:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
know saying you know referencing the rul
 
04:44:13.470 --> 04:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
making RSA
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
541a uh you know the rules to be
 
04:44:18.510 --> 04:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
developed pursuant to
 
04:44:22.270 --> 04:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
541a relative to the components or
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of the you know of this so
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think rule making would be
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient on I think we would need to
 
04:44:31.150 --> 04:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
frame it up a little bit more okay uh
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
than that and it probably wouldn't
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
belong in um
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh actually is is Bol and3 is that the
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
section that defines what goes in the
 
04:44:40.320 --> 04:44:43.070 align:start position:0%
section that defines what goes in the
charter

04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
charter
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay and see you know I I think that if
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting into where I'm having a
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding where we're
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
going we're only talking about in this
 
04:44:59.200 --> 04:45:00.070 align:start position:0%
going we're only talking about in this
whole

04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill the state appropriated dollars for
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
building Aid and the if the receiving
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
Charter School receives six years worth
 
04:45:13.470 --> 04:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
of building Aid and they're only getting
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
30% of their project over a period of 20
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
years so it's going to be as Amy just
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me 12th each
 
04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
year so that after seven years whatever
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
that one 20th adds up to that's what
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
they'd have to repay to the state
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
pursuant to current
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
building Aid which requires any Public
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
School receives monies for construction
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
or renovation and they close this down
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
and if there's not some kind of an
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
exemption issued by the state
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
board they have to pay it back right and
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
the and the the public school district
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
has um access to resources after after a
 
04:46:01.708 --> 04:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
shutdown um you know in the in the case
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
of a chartered public school where the
 
04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
um where a
 
04:46:06.798 --> 04:46:09.788 align:start position:0%
um where a
um

04:46:09.788 --> 04:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
dissolution voluntary or involuntary
 
04:46:15.910 --> 04:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
dissolution event um May um maybe
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
because of bankruptcy there's there's
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
you know probably not any assets left to
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
distribute so so uh um I mean the
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy court would handle the um you
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
know clearing of any leans or
 
04:46:34.350 --> 04:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
mortgages and uh once that's done you
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
know it will be you know the office
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
supply place will be there with their
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
hands open the state will be with their
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
hands open but there's no more assets
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
left and and I think that's a concern
 
04:46:45.200 --> 04:46:48.590 align:start position:0%
left and and I think that's a concern
from

04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh represent Celli thank you there still
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
very probably are some physical assets
 
04:47:00.390 --> 04:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
computers desks Furniture Etc um and uh
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
have to remember that um as we heard in
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
the I don't know what the name of the
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee was the uh um dissolution the
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
charter dissolution yeah committee
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee um the Department of Justice
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see a a written testimony that I
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
handed out from the Department of
 
04:47:22.350 --> 04:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
Justice uh charitable trust division
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
about their involvement with all this
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
and they get involved um uh and require
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
as part of the Articles of agreement of
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
any nonprofit including Charters um a
 
04:47:33.558 --> 04:47:34.590 align:start position:0%
any nonprofit including Charters um a
dissolution

04:47:34.590 --> 04:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
agreement um which is um probably more
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than um what is in the uh
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh Charter School
 
04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
application um under current state state
 
04:47:50.590 --> 04:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
law RSA
 
04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
2922 it's which is the Department of
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
Justice uh Roman 3 says the provisions
 
04:47:58.510 --> 04:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
for disposition of corporate Assets in
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
the event of dissolution of the
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
corporation including the
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
prioritization of rights of shareholders
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
and members to corporate
 
04:48:07.558 --> 04:48:11.110 align:start position:0%
and members to corporate
assets

04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.830 --> 04:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
so and you'll see in the document that
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
um the Char the charitable trust
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
division gets involved when there is
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
such a uh dissolution such a
 
04:48:26.430 --> 04:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy uh they are involved um as
 
04:48:26.440 --> 04:48:27.270 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy uh they are involved um as
the

04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
primary um state agency in that legal
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:37.628 align:start position:0%
primary um state agency in that legal
process

04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
the uh I looked at the state of
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Department of Education
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
and secondary education regarding
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
charter school closing
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
procedures and they have written clearly
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
in their's enlarged bold type here the
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
school may not dispose of any fixed
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
assets until de that's Department of
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
Education uh education Elementary
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
secondary or whatever has approved the
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
asset disposition plan so that's why I
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
tried to copy that material into this um
 
04:49:19.628 --> 04:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
fixed assets so I'm we're only talking
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
about so they wouldn't be able to dump
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
off any other fixed assets which could
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
be anything from property to buildings
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
to equipment to
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
Furniture um and some of that's
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
described in federal accounting law a
 
04:49:34.400 --> 04:49:36.030 align:start position:0%
described in federal accounting law a
regulation

04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
but what I think Massachusetts is saying
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
can't uh see may not dispose of any
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
fixed assets until the department down
 
04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
there has gotten
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
their Equity back out of
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that facility or their portion which
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
they've contributed
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
um but I think I hear you saying what
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
are the components of this plan to
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that um there's going to be or
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
and also to ensure that there's going to
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
be the capability of
 
04:50:16.868 --> 04:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
providing those seven years or whatever
 
04:50:18.750 --> 04:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
years worth of state aid they've
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
received but beyond that I'm not really
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
too concerned because that's not part of
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
this particular process the State
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
Building Aid it would be other things
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the what represent cordelli
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
has mentioned
 
04:50:37.150 --> 04:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
chairs and
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
desks well the chairs and desks those
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
are fixed assets
 
04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
equipment building property but that's
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
not gon that's not going to add up I
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
mean real estate is where the is where
 
04:50:50.190 --> 04:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
the asset
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
lies you know it's not with
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
the so if they own their building
 
04:50:58.750 --> 04:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to get rid of it
 
04:51:01.230 --> 04:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
somehow they may sell
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
it or they may you know it might be
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
taken from them because they're owing
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
other people money well so yeah that's
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying so so the the um you
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
know the proposal here is that is that
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
um a charter would get 30% of its
 
04:51:18.878 --> 04:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
um a charter would get 30% of its
construction

04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
construction
 
04:51:22.548 --> 04:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
costs covered through building AIDS so
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
70% of those construction costs are
 
04:51:27.548 --> 04:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
coming from other you know access to
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
other resources most likely through a
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
mortgage Bond and um
 
04:51:38.350 --> 04:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
and so when it comes to dispose of the
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
um the asset
 
04:51:44.350 --> 04:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
um you know that will be the first part
 
04:51:44.360 --> 04:51:48.868 align:start position:0%
um you know that will be the first part
that

04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
gets gets gets taken care of and and
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah Ian like Banks like to make sure
 
04:52:00.750 --> 04:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
that that uh that homeowners have some
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
skin in the
 
04:52:06.190 --> 04:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
game mhm so would would not then the
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
legisl that sentence that I read from
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts here School may not
 
04:52:15.548 --> 04:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
dispose of any fixed assets until Dee
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
has approved the asset disposition plan
 
04:52:20.910 --> 04:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's great if you've got if you've got
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
assets remaining after everybody else
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
that's ahead of the head of the state
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
has has has has had their leads paid off
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
mortgage paid off stuff like that you
 
04:52:32.670 --> 04:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm just saying that by by the time
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
you get down to this
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
there's um unlikely to be much value
 
04:52:41.788 --> 04:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
left is it possible put the state being
 
04:52:44.548 --> 04:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
repaid first before all those others you
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
could but then you run into exactly what
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
Mike Mike said which is absolutely true
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that a bank is not going to want to
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
be in the number two position they're
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
not going to want to be in the number
 
04:52:55.160 --> 04:52:58.590 align:start position:0%
not going to want to be in the number
two

04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
one represent Celli um but as I read
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
before from
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
um current Statute in the Department of
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
Justice charitable trusts the
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
disposition of the
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
Assets in the
 
04:53:19.708 --> 04:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
um the provisions for disposition
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
include the prioritization of Rights of
 
04:53:24.990 --> 04:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
of shareholders and members to those
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
assets so if um the state is made U
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
priority in terms of recouping the
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
amount of school building Aid um to date
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
given to that uh nonprofit then I I
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
is if we prioritize the state at the top
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
yeah with that language and modifying it
 
04:53:58.510 --> 04:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
we could put ourselves at the top of the
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the repay
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
payback and that's in the disposition
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
plan if then uh right the the bank reads
 
04:54:08.590 --> 04:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
that disposition plan says we don't like
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
it we're not going to provide you any
 
04:54:12.270 --> 04:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
support for the
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
70% and that would be that it and then
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the deal is done right there but if
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
they agree to that and realizing that
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to have to be paid back is
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
really not a heck of a lot of money
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
really when you look at it if you're
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
talking about a project that's um let's
 
04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
say it's a $1.52 million project which
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
is probably Way Beyond a lot of the
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools are going to get at
 
04:54:46.510 --> 04:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
30% and so the state portion would be
 
04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
that $2
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
million and that it's going to be paid
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
off to the back to the the charter
 
04:54:57.750 --> 04:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
school over a period of 20 years and
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
12th and that because the 2 million is
 
04:55:05.310 --> 04:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
30% of the total cost they're going to
 
04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
get 12th of two 2 million each year so
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
how much is APPA say seven
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
years what what's you know there's not a
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
hell of a lot of money there but we've
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
incurred on the state the tail
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
Amy

04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
Amy
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
other words you have bank roll so much
 
04:55:39.070 --> 04:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
money for that tail right right pay that
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
every year correct but we wouldn't um so
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
with your example so that's $2 million
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
let's say was that was that was their
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
award the department would be paying
 
04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to them every year for 20 years
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
if they went bankrupt or closed after
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
year five the state would have invested
 
04:56:02.830 --> 04:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
$500,000 um and the argument it sounds
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
like is that it would be difficult to
 
04:56:07.628 --> 04:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
get that $500,000 back that may or may
 
04:56:10.150 --> 04:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
not be true U but then we would have had
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
money set aside but the charger School
 
04:56:13.548 --> 04:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any ability to tap into
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
that we would just roll that back into
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
um the building Aid fund should one
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
exist um so um the only other point I
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
think is important to remember um with
 
04:56:26.230 --> 04:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
this conversation is that there's
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's lease Aid which is a lease Aid
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
to to charter schools that pays every
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
year towards
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's like rent so I mean one way to look
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
at this I think that disposition
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
language was really
 
04:56:43.230 --> 04:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
important from my perspective the
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
disposition language is very very
 
04:56:48.190 --> 04:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
important if you're going to pay them
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
like you pay the public district schools
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
and give them all the money upfront but
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill does it pays
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
them over a 20-year period so
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
essentially you're paying them in a
 
04:57:01.948 --> 04:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
similar structure to lease Aid you're
 
04:57:05.070 --> 04:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
never ever going to recoup a back so for
 
04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
me in my my perspective is the
 
04:57:08.120 --> 04:57:09.548 align:start position:0%
me in my my perspective is the
disillusion

04:57:09.548 --> 04:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
disillusion
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
Clause isn't
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily important um for me anyway
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
the way I look at it because it's just
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
like lease Aid
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we we have a cap on lease
 
04:57:27.150 --> 04:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
Aid uh of $50,000 a year and you know if
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
they close in 5 years we're never going
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
to get that lease Aid back um so similar
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
to this structure now if you were to
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
change structure and put that all up
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
front where you're giving them the $2
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
million up front absolutely because it
 
04:57:42.190 --> 04:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
could close next year and the state
 
04:57:44.430 --> 04:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
would be out all of their money um
 
04:57:47.350 --> 04:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's at least my perspective of it but
 
04:57:50.110 --> 04:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
to answer your question if they close in
 
04:57:53.310 --> 04:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
five years short term we have that tail
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
we just take that money and we put it
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
back into the fund that's not a problem
 
04:57:56.718 --> 04:57:59.750 align:start position:0%
back into the fund that's not a problem
at

04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.760 --> 04:58:02.110 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay further anything else of uh Amy
 
04:58:05.680 --> 04:58:06.750 align:start position:0%
okay further anything else of uh Amy
right

04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
now represent Dr per me
 
04:58:11.440 --> 04:58:13.430 align:start position:0%
now represent Dr per me
no

04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay go
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
ahead well we're still on 354 yeah thank
 
04:58:21.628 --> 04:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
you okay I agree subject thank you Mr
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to make sure that
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
we are not missing something that we
 
04:58:30.030 --> 04:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
heard a long time ago in this bill which
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
is what representative Mooney said was a
 
04:58:36.788 --> 04:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
current contradiction in the law and
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have settled that in
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
some way or not and to refresh your
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
memory it was that uh RSA 184 in one
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
section says that school Charter Public
 
04:58:51.190 --> 04:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools don't get money if they
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
don't own their building that's taken
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
care of on page six it is last last line
 
04:58:57.190 --> 04:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
right above above the effective
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
date okay it's
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
leus yes on the non disolution part of
 
04:59:13.548 --> 04:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
it we were talking about um paying the
 
04:59:17.230 --> 04:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
5% of the El eligible Grant and doing it
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
over 20 years um and I had asked how
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
much more that ends up
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
costing so for example for a three
 
04:59:32.990 --> 04:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
million loan if you have if you have 3%
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
% rate it's 740,000
 
04:59:40.030 --> 04:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
extra interest and if it's a 6% loan
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's $ 1.6
 
04:59:45.628 --> 04:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
million of extra interest so yes we're
 
04:59:47.310 --> 04:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
protecting the
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
state by not paying out that much but on
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
the other hand we're costing the charter
 
04:59:57.310 --> 04:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
school an awful lot of money in extra
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
interest well that's why we went to the
 
05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
80% Upfront for the frer public school
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
exactly and the 20% upon completion
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
exactly and so that was the rationale
 
05:00:14.030 --> 05:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
right and and and it and the rationale
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
still holds for Charter
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
Schools but this bill's not treating the
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools the same I know and
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this bill that's why
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm pointing it out and but this is the
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
way it was presented to us by
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney I
 
05:00:31.830 --> 05:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
know with that payment scheme yes
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
represent Bel
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and just to follow
 
05:00:37.708 --> 05:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
up on the testimony we just heard plus
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
what um rep leus had to say it does seem
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
like that if we were to put the state in
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
a position of first to be recouping
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
their uh funds and thereby probably
 
05:00:53.190 --> 05:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
cutting them off from access to private
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
funds because Banks don't want to be
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
second position it seems like this on
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
the whole would be doing more harm than
 
05:01:03.070 --> 05:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
good so I think if we were going to move
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
forward with this it's something we
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
either not demand that the state be in
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
first payer um because again these are
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
these are public schools they're all
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
public schools come with some risk to
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
the state for the very minimum perhaps
 
05:01:22.470 --> 05:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
some sort of a proportionality
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:43.150 --> 05:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
thing do we have to modify it to explain
 
05:01:47.200 --> 05:01:48.310 align:start position:0%
thing do we have to modify it to explain
more

05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
about um how how the state makes
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
up for the money or how the charter
 
05:01:58.510 --> 05:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
school is going to pay back what they
 
05:02:03.548 --> 05:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
owe the state if it closes
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
or we'd leave it the way it is with that
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
sentence there on page on line 13 14 15
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
six which is basically very similar to
 
05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
what they
 
05:02:19.868 --> 05:02:19.878 align:start position:0%
have with
 
05:02:23.910 --> 05:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
masses or do we give
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to the department State
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to develop through Ru
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
making the process for
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
or you what are the what are the
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
components and what's the criteria for
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
that disposition plan I don't
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.878 --> 05:02:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
too

05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have a conversation
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
probably on the 13th if we don't try to
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
get a little bit of you know amending
 
05:03:02.760 --> 05:03:04.230 align:start position:0%
get a little bit of you know amending
language

05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.788 --> 05:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
not how many people are supportive of
 
05:03:18.548 --> 05:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
not so it kind of looks like it's going
 
05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
line so it'll come out one of those 10
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
10 votes and we'll have to hack it out
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
on the floor looks like that's where
 
05:03:37.638 --> 05:03:52.190 align:start position:0%
on the floor looks like that's where
we're

05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
going well what we need then is an
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah we need an amendment
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
because what we've got here is the
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
amendment which I thought we could
 
05:04:07.310 --> 05:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
probably get more support for obviously
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's to me this is boiling down
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
to some folks just not wanting to give
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
building a to Charter
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Schools whatever the rational is that's
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
what it's it's coming down
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
to so it's okay to send building a to
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
one form of public school but it's not
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay to send building a to another
 
05:04:30.718 --> 05:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
okay to send building a to another
Public

05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
Public
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:34.310 align:start position:0%
Public
School

05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so I you know I think it's
 
05:04:40.750 --> 05:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
pretty clear particularly in the um in
 
05:04:43.150 --> 05:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
the report in the memo from the charal
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
trust unit that um Char of schools of
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire let's see required to
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
register uh organized as voluntary
 
05:04:54.548 --> 05:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
corporations um so they're not um
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not public they're
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
they're private corporations under
 
05:05:02.590 --> 05:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
501c3 so so I think there's very much
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
distinction between um uh supporting
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
public school districts which are which
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
are um paid for by New Hampshire
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and using New Hampshire
 
05:05:14.310 --> 05:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to support that and
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
supporting private corporations uh uh
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
facilities which are not owned by uh and
 
05:05:22.670 --> 05:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
are not paid for by New Hampshire
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I think I think there's
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's a very clear difference between
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
Institutions and not to mention that
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
we've got a $250 million backlog or
 
05:05:38.350 --> 05:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
something like that in um in requests
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
for um for um State Building aid from
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
districts it's okay
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
to provide them up to a Max of $50,000
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
year for
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
leasing but we're not going to provide
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
anything for building which is a
 
05:06:05.070 --> 05:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
probably when you have ownership there's
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
better care facilities there's more
 
05:06:11.548 --> 05:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
it I guess we're gonna have to have this
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
debate on the house
 
05:06:19.390 --> 05:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
floor yes represent cascaden um my
 
05:06:24.190 --> 05:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
stumbling block is really that um the
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
districts um have to have the support of
 
05:06:28.878 --> 05:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
districts um have to have the support of
the

05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
voters and Charters don't they don't
 
05:06:35.868 --> 05:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the voters to decide
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
whether they renovate or build or
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
do so that's that's one of my stumbling
 
05:06:45.150 --> 05:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
blocks and then this whole issue of
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid no matter what who it's
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
for is the
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
backlog and the money is just not enough
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
for anybody to do anything substantial
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
other than what three projects if that
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
or two I mean it's a lot of work to get
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
ready for a building Aid application to
 
05:07:05.708 --> 05:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
MH it's the
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
system per cordelli thank you I would
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
say it's a lot of work um for charter
 
05:07:20.350 --> 05:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
schools to apply for their
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
Charter um a lot of work even more
 
05:07:25.230 --> 05:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
because you have to do U curriculum
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations and how your curriculum
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
compares to the state standards um Etc
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
and in terms of um
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know Public Schools
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
depend um on the
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
voters um however Charter Schools depend
 
05:07:47.910 --> 05:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
on parents wanting to enroll their
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
children there and if parents don't want
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
to enroll their children there for any
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
reason the charter will close so it's um
 
05:08:00.030 --> 05:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
even more of a requirement for Charter
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
Schools if they want to survive to meet
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.590 --> 05:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
students is there any more discussion
 
05:08:12.190 --> 05:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
here on
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
354 okay we're going to close 354 down
 
05:08:22.220 --> 05:08:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.200 --> 05:08:39.310 align:start position:0%
 
have

05:08:39.310 --> 05:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
is5 and I do have a hand out here in
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
what I did I simply took 155 assets
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
introduced and deleted areas which we
 
05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
disced discussed before um we can
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
quickly go through this we should be
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
able to get this I think done in about
 
05:09:37.840 --> 05:09:40.628 align:start position:0%
able to get this I think done in about
five

05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.190 --> 05:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
minutes well let's see if we're right
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay um and just briefly explaining
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
it uh this was presented Remember by
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
Steve applebe to us from doe he
 
05:09:57.030 --> 05:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
recommended that number seven be
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
scratched that's no longer
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.510 --> 05:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
one oh yeah on p on line three to be the
 
05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
same as the chancellor the community
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
college system where they have New
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or design we'd add or design
 
05:10:19.150 --> 05:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
for the University
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.350 --> 05:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
well on the next page um where it said
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
at the top the commissioner shall on on
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
well there not not mine's not numbered
 
05:10:36.990 --> 05:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
with lines but uh up at the top there uh
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
four lines down e the commissioner sh
 
05:10:42.030 --> 05:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion whether we
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
should have may but if you had May then
 
05:10:46.230 --> 05:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
we had to change some other things so
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's recommended we keep the Sha there
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
and eliminate number four down
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
below and then renumber going
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
thereafter and then scratch out
 
05:11:00.110 --> 05:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
everything that has to do with the shity
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
indentification on the postsecondary
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
career Schools starting at the bottom of
 
05:11:06.990 --> 05:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
the page to see all the lines out that
 
05:11:09.030 --> 05:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
second half the bill is
 
05:11:11.788 --> 05:11:11.798 align:start position:0%
gone effective date Remains the
 
05:11:15.030 --> 05:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
Same that would be the if we're
 
05:11:17.708 --> 05:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
agreeable we can get an amendment made
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%

s SP 266 we're not meeting again but I'm
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:48.120 --> 05:11:51.548 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.350 --> 05:11:56.360 align:start position:0%

graduation rate being knocked down
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%

05:12:59.080 --> 05:13:00.750 align:start position:0%
to what is it
60

05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
60
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
67% used to be 69% for two consecutive
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
67% yes there is that's why it's been

05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
okay so there are a few bills I've seen
 
05:13:43.150 --> 05:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
there that I think we should be able to
 
05:13:43.160 --> 05:13:44.270 align:start position:0%
there that I think we should be able to
agree

05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
agree
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
