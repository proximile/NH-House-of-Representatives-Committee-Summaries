action in the last session is the uh
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
program to help train the court security
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%

relative to uh this budget process We
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
Stand ready to deliver that program uh
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
either as a a full academy uh and then
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
we also stand ready to Pivot if needed
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
and uh turn that into what we would
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
refer to as an inservice program where
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
we would deliver uh small blocks of
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
instruction throughout the year uh to
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
help uh facilitate the training and stay
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible as well yeah thanks
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's interesting to see it's it pulled
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
out specifically for different roles of
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um about the pricus
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
intervention training that's gone it
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
seems there's no money in that here did
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
it move someplace else because there's
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
you know the $1 million you reference it
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you I'm going to ask uh Max
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to that it may have just gone
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
question we moved the general funding to
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
cover shortfalls that would be in our
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
operating budget to to fill so that we
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to ur any layoffs or program
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
loss but there was a continuously
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
appropriated fund that's non lapsing
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
that will continue on through each year
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
of the budget through the next bium um
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
that is was through the legislation that
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
created the funding but it was very
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
specific to only TR one officer in each
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
agency and we were using the general
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
funds to train up to three or four
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
officers in each agency as well as
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
provide as much CIT Crisis Intervention
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
training as possible to police agencies
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
so that fund that you don't see uh is a
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
continuously non- laabs sying that
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
continues to pass on and I I believe
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's around $800,000 left in
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
there oh yeah I'm looking at page 11 84
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's going to help
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
you at all where um it was you know $1.1
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
million program and it looks like it's
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
gone it in the next year it'll be
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
$43,750 um I'm assuming that's one it's
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
like one person has been left in that
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
Division and if the crisis is if the
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
training is ongoing can you point me to
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
where that money is now it it I would
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
have to ask our business supervisor
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
essentially but it the money is
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated non lapsing so
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't show in our current budget
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
but and I'm saying in our in our
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
proposal budget it's in our current
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
operating budget and will'll transfer
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
over because it's continuously
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated not lapsing so the
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
remainder of what we haven't spent in
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
this bium will just simply move over so
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
you don't see it and that's not
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that's not recognized but we
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
will continue that program uh for up to
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
one officer in each agency has
 
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.430 align:start position:0%
one officer in each agency has
legislation

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
States okay
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
and on the page before um
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
1183 can you just explain the um the
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance other than buildings and
 
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.350 align:start position:0%
maintenance other than buildings and
grounds

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
um it looks like there was huh there was
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance that was done and so that's
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
finished but then there's um
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
contractural maintenance that's going up
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
by a couple hundred thousand um to so
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
that would be under class 48 yes yeah I
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
was I was looking at 24 this looks like
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
that work is done done um 48 it looks
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
like there's new work that's coming
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
online so there were a couple things
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
that were moved around is we had a
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
software records management software
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
that was not properly classified in the
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
last budget that was under class 24
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
which we moved to the appropriate class
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
software line so we're funding that in
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Place uh the other large
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
change that we had in class 48 is we uh
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
reclassified two building service worker
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
two positions for uh janitorial work we
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
were unable to fill them repeatedly and
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
administrative Services were unable to
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
help us fill those positions or even
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide for cleaning of our facility so
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
we actually uh reclassified those and
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
then we were able to get uh enough
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
funding to support a contract for
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
janitorial services which was actually a
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
cost reduction over the salary and
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
benefits of those two full-time
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
positions so we achieved a cost savings
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
and we are still having we have a
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
contract now so we're moving funding
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
into that line to support the contract
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
for the B so that's just moving things
 
00:21:11.159 --> 00:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
for the B so that's just moving things
around

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
again
um

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
and it looks like you're hiring a time
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'm back on 1183 I've got my notes all
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
over the place um line 50 they're hiring
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
a temp person is this a new this is a
 
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.070 align:start position:0%
a temp person is this a new this is a
new

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
have there no um personal service temp
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
appointee or temp appointed yes so we
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's two positions uh one is actually my
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
part-time position and and one is for
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
our administrative rule coordinator okay
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
to we have a in the process of redoing
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
all of our administrative rules and
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
these are classified as temporary is
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
that what that
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
means 50 uh 50 page 11 yes all positions
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
are classified as temporary part-time
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's how they classifi and these are
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
all considered part-time positions huh
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
you and we address the training Council
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
number 22 you'd like that's in
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
HB hb2 um or the where you can use some
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
of the people from the law enfor the
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
academy for law enforcement details it's
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the number 22 um and the other thing I'm
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
just curious where'd it go it just made
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
me chuckle um on
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
1186 food for institutions in Department
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
that's feeding all your trainees your
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct yes they need to be f
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
um how many sessions do you do in a year
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
uh for the last two years during the uh
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
really the bium that we're in now and
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
the one prior to
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is reflective of uh what
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing going on not only in the
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but Nationwide
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
quite frankly uh there was a just a
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous glut of
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
officers uh that left the business right
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
after uh the police reform initiatives
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
hit um a couple of years ago and uh
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
there was a large group of people that
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
were still
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
applying and so there was this massive
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh vacancy rate across the state and
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
then we had a very large group of people
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
that were hirable and these agencies
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
hired them we had to increase our
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
training to uh include overlapping acmis
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we ran four full-time
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
policey uh over the last two and a half
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
years uh and that was to kind of take on
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
the address the urgency of turning
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
around these new recruits to fill those
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
massive open positions uh across the
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
state uh candidly uh the staff at police
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
engine training really had to up their
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
game and they were uh uh they were
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
really starting to get
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
burnt uh at the same time we started to
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
see the urgency kind of decrease a
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
little bit there was less people in the
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline and the vacancy rates were not
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
nearly as bad so this year uh the the
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
sitting class right now uh is the
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
beginning of a return to only running
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
three full-time acmis a year we're going
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
to be running two Corrections acmis this
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
year uh we are running right now now one
 
00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:01.230 align:start position:0%
year uh we are running right now now one
part-time

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
Academy we will look at the numbers for
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
a part-time Academy if we have to run a
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
second one this
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
year and uh we stand ready to deliver
 
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.110 align:start position:0%
year and uh we stand ready to deliver
for

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh court security officer
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
acmy uh but again we we are also going
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
to be very uh flexible with regard to uh
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
whatever uh our Collective budgets will
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
allow us and if uh if AOC is not in a
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
position uh
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
to deliver people for a full Academy
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
then will pivot back to the the
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
inservice model so three full-time one
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
part-time possibly
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
two two Corrections acmis standing by on
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
four court security officer acmy for
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
2025 and I'm interested uh size of the
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
class age range and instate out of state
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
men women
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question and and
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
we can really dial down I don't have
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
those specifics on uh gender and age but
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
we can certainly get that for you uh we
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh run now uh 65 recruits per
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
academy uh understanding that we're
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
going to see an attrition rate uh you
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
know usually the first week people
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
decide that this is not for them and uh
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that's fine uh we usually lose about
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
on average 2.5 per class in the first
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
week uh unfortunately we may see an
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
additional one in every class on average
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
that has uh a blip on a weekend that all
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
of a sudden uh prevents them from
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
pursuing law enforcement in New
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um we'll run three of
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
those classes a year at 65 uh
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
Corrections Academy will also run up to
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh 55 although we're just not seeing
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers and that is no fault to
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
anybody it's just a recruitment and
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
retention issue that we're facing right
 
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.110 align:start position:0%
retention issue that we're facing right
now

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
particularly in in the area of uh
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers it's just it's
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
tough to
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
recruit um we see
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
about and this is this is something that
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
the council needs to address moving
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
forward and it was part of the leak uh
 
00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh we're trying to find
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
kind of Middle Ground around here uh but
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
the governor uh directed us to really
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
look hard at the part-time police
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
certification program and um you know
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
really try to decide whether that's
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
something that we should continue or
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
whether we should eliminate a lot of
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
States eliminated their part-time
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
certification program in the wake of the
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
most uh recent wave of police
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
reform and uh at the same time as a
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
former police chief of a smaller agency
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh I and particularly sensitive and and
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
so is the council relative to these much
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies that rely on that
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
part-time help we're only seeing
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 12 recruits per session for
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
a part uh part-time police academy and
 
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.509 align:start position:0%
a part uh part-time police academy and
um

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
nonetheless uh even with 10 or 12 uh we
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
still have to run the academy and and it
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
takes resources it takes uh
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh people to teach the programs uh we do
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
still do you know firearms and driving
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
program and so it it it's still a drain
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
on the resources we're not getting as
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
much uh return on that investment again
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
because we're not filling the class it
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
would be much more efficient if we could
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
put you know 30 40 people in a program
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
like that and run it uh we do see
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh you hate to call them kids because
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
they're not kids they're signing up for
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
a dangerous job but Young people that
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
are you know 18 20 years old and uh we
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
have seen people who have literally had
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
other careers and uh have retired from
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
those initial careers and then have come
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
back uh to serve as a New Hampshire law
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer uh people that are
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
in their uh 50s uh I want to say that a
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
couple of classes ago we had somebody
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
who was over the age of 60 and candidly
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
outperformed uh physically and and
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
academically a whole lot more than
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
uh some of their class members um uh but
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
we we do see uh a lot of diversity with
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
regard to age uh fair amount with gender
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
we we have U uh we see more uh female uh
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
recruits coming through our doors and uh
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I would say you know
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
um it's hopefully the pendulum is
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
swinging back and people are are going
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
to be excited and committed to public
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
service and to serve our state uh as a
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement officer so
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully those numbers will increase
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
and just one last thing around the Lea
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
going back to that
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
um some years ago there
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
were conversations fairly contentious
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
conversations about confidentiality of
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
policemen who are on certain lists um
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the public should
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
have access to who they are um some of
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
it was this is not a reliable person in
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
the court system and I mean there are a
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
whole lot of issues can you just speak
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the current um flavor or discussions
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
around those issues of confidentiality
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
for a policeman who's had a misconduct
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
Al allegation thank you for that
 
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.350 align:start position:0%
Al allegation thank you for that
question

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
I I'll say that it the the answer is a
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
bit complicated in the first instance
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the first instance there was a
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
list a long time ago it was referred to
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
as the Lor list and that Lorry list uh
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
contained names of police officers that
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
had been put on by their uh Chiefs
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
because their Chiefs felt that there was
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of a exculpatory issue uh that
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
would need to be brought up uh and
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
revealed to a defense attorneys during
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
trial uh and uh the truth was that at
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
the time there was not a lot of guard
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
rails or standards that were set that
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
would have provided provided uniform due
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
process uh or uh uniform definitions of
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
what would put you on the list it was
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
almost kind of a uh you know whatever
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
the chief felt I think that's important
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
let me put you on the list uh in some
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
cases uh my understanding is that some
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
officers were placed on the list and
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't even know they were put on
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
the list so that so I think one of the
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
steps uh that has been
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
taken is uh the old lawal list which is
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
now referred to as the sculp uh the
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
exculpatory list right um the
 
00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:04.509 align:start position:0%
exculpatory list right um the
EES

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
EES
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh that uh that is now uh through the uh
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
the AG's office there's now a process by
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
which if you were on that old list uh
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
you are entitled to um be heard in court
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh in in Supreme Court uh relative to
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
whether you really should be on the list
 
00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:24.350 align:start position:0%
whether you really should be on the list
or

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
not in the meantime leak uh created a
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
different way to address allegations of
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
misconduct and and candidly we're very
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
proud of how this came to be because
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
really uh through the conduct Review
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
Committee under RSA
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
106 L uh we defined statutorily what
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
misconduct was uh which means it also
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
helps Define what it isn't uh and so
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has a uni formed definition of
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
what misconduct is uh secondly uh that
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
law also really uh provided for a very
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
uniform application of due process and
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
fairness across the board so that the
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
process uh allow due process to the
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
officer and it also uh provided a very
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
objective way to take on these
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
complaints from citizens right that need
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
addressed uh and finally uh there was a
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
law passed that said that uh there it's
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a reduction in the exculpatory
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
evidence schedule the EES where Chiefs
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
may put their people on uh check that
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
the AG's office may continue to maintain
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
a list uh in the meantime under RSC
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
106l uh we are now required
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
statutorily on a sustained finding that
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
the allegation was appropriate that um
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
it met the definition of misconduct and
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
the investigation uh had enough facts to
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
prove the case Beyond a
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
preponderance uh they're entitled to
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
have a hearing in front of the police
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council on the
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
merits of the case and then uh are also
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to be heard on the the
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
disposition or penalty uh phase uh that
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
we would publicly uh publish those
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
sustained findings on our
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
website and so in essence that is is
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
kind of the list that is going to take
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
over uh to the list that you spoke to uh
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and that's the old
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
Lori list uh also known as the
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence schedule uh and
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
that may or may not uh continue that's
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
under the AG uh but in the meantime this
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
public finding under the police stand
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
and training Council rules uh does uh
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
mandate that we uh provide that list to
 
00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:55.790 align:start position:0%
mandate that we uh provide that list to
the

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
public thank you for all the updates and
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and represent
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair I doo have a
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
list uh which as it happens kind of dove
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
tailes in with what we were talking
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
about uh could you start by telling us
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know when you look at a for me
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
necessary statute to rule changes I'm
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
looking at changes to definition of
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
police misconduct and whatnot you were
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
mentioning later in your presentation
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that this was supposed to be a b but
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
then it was done under hb2 could you
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
help me understand what those changes
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
are and why they're not going through
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
the uh normal legislative process other
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
than the governor's office requesting
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you sir for that question
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh really the
 
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.990 align:start position:0%
uh really the
um

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
the we'll address the biggest uh piece
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
to that first and that is that uh the
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh check
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
that check that
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
the accreditation program was
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
established through executive
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
order and uh spelled out how the uh
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
accreditation committee would be formed
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh what their uh scope of responsibility
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
was all of that was contained in
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
executive order and and really all we're
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is capture that executive
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
order in statute at this point um again
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
we were uh initially told to pursue
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
those changes through hb2 at our first
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
presentation uh I was directed uh by uh
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
a member of that committee uh Senator
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
gray to uh not pursue it through hb2 and
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
to instead uh find somebody to uh put
 
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.950 align:start position:0%
to instead uh find somebody to uh put
forth

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh introduce it through a
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh and I did exactly that um and
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
was able to um uh work with
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative Terry Roy who introduced
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
777 and
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
778 at the same time I reached back out
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
to the governor's office and advised
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
them that I had been directed by the go
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
by the uh Senator gray to uh make those
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes and the governor's office and
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative Roy uh both uh felt that
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
that uh they would pursue these two
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh on both sides both
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
through hb2 and to continue the
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
legislative process uh I have since uh
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
testified in front of uh the criminal
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
justice committee on uh 777 and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
778 uh the committee voted unanimously
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
to support
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
778 uh they were ready to vote uh for SE
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh check that 777 uh they were ready to
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
vote on 778 uh but I did have to ask for
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
an oral amendment to be made uh which
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
really did not change the
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
the make a material change to it was
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
very slight change uh they were prepared
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
to vote on it but because of that oral
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment they had to uh uh bring it
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
back once it was
 
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.069 align:start position:0%
back once it was
written

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
um if I may jump in for a sec I'm sorry
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
sir if I may jump in for a sec and I
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the color information the
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
background I think we're in a good place
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of my question because this is
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
going through a normal legislative
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
process in is in in front of the
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
committee the decision whether a bill
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
adopted on the house floor you know goes
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
back to the house floor after Finance or
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 is a finance decision but I did want
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure really that we went through
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
a full legislative hearing process and
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
everybody had an opportunity to speak
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth so that seems to
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
you know be in place so don't worry
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
we'll wait for those bills to be
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
incoming our way and keep in mind uh the
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know color information that you
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
provided so I I appreciate that thank
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
you um and if I may change gears and go
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
back to numbers a little bit Oh by all
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
means oh sorry I apolog just the help of
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
those two bills the 777 which is the
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
accreditation commission that has passed
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
and that is on to the Senate 778
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the details that Amendment
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
has already passed to that I think the
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
director was referring to and that bill
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
has passed and will be going to the
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
Senate so house position on both of
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
those bills has been set they are not
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
second committee bills so uh in
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
reference to the what the governor has
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
in her trailer Bill relative to the
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
details this committee could have the
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
decision of um removing it and letting
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 778 just run its course or
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
amending the trailer Bill house bill to
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
to align exactly with what the house
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
passed because you would want to pass
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
conflicting legislation so that's a
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
decision for this committee I know but
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
bills what would be our rationale for
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
putting them in hb2 since they never
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
were formally presented to finance I
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the governor's point of view
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the suggestions but it would be
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
interesting to justify that particular
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
approach wouldn't
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
it that would be up to the committee to
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
justify that approach it's not uh
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
unprecedented that a bill will pass
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
separately and then also be incorporated
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 for various reasons
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
you go ahead yeah thank you so my
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
original plan had a lot of numbers
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
involved so um I'm going to start from
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the top I'm looking at your
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
Administration and standards uh line8
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know Department
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
8980 and and I'm looking at the uh P say
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
again p uh page number 1182 at the very
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
1182 so I'm looking for that particular
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
entity you have a significant increase
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
in personal services
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
permanent but for the same division you
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
appear to go from 12 to lose a position
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
so basically I'm seeing one less
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
position but an additional 150,000 in
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
compensation could you help me stand
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question I
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
I moved positions to where they were
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
more appropriate within the agency under
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um uh accounting head so if uh for
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
instance we had someone who belonged
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
under uh accreditation which would be
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
under um Administration and standards I
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
moved them out of training and so that
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
was just moving positions around to
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
where they're more appropriate for
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
funding I understand I mean I looked at
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
your bottom line and Essen your total
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
number of positions for the entire
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
organization is flat so I get that you
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
are moving people around I'm just
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
curious why you know people got Mo a
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
person got moved out but 150k in
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
additional compensation got moved in I
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
would have expected that if you decrease
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
the positions I'll see a drop so I I
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to be overly detailed but
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
150k increase with one less person in
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
there is uh something that's worth I
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
believe we move two positions around I I
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the specifics right if we
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
could provide that later that would be
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
great I I I would appreciate it because
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
again it's a biggish number change there
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
i' like to understand and um on the next
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
page um I see a significant drop in uh
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
on page 1183 line 024 maintenance other
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
than building grounds it drops by about
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
2/3 I'm assuming it's part of the
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
overall attempt to control cost but I
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to make assumptions I'd
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
rather uh understand thank you for the
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
question this is the the answer that I
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
give to representative Murray which is
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
that we had had our records management
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
software in an inappropriate class which
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
was a so it's covered under that moved
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
it onto software and created a new line
 
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.510 align:start position:0%
it onto software and created a new line
in

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
software okay so to make sure I fully
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
understand um in the past while the
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
amounts were budgeted for grounds we
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
used the ability to move funds around to
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
deal with other priorities and now we're
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
just moving them into the budget so we
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
need to so we decrease the need to just
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
transfer in between different funds yes
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
just moving it to the appropriate place
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
where software belongs and you'll notice
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the 038 line you'll
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
see it went from Z to
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
206,000 and then in 27 to 27,000 that is
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
for our records management software
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
guess what my next question was going to
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
be yeah yes so that is the uh Records
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
management yes sir and any other
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
additional software that it does not
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
cover for us and is that
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
a it looks to be recurring right is that
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
a new B basically because it's a new
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
thing do you have any startup costs or
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
is that the operational budget going
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
forward thank you for your question uh
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
we we had a software called Benchmark
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
and we were uh using the state contract
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
for software on an annual basis but they
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
were not suiting all of our needs for
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
officer record management and they were
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
charging us very large increases each
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
year so we went through an elaborate RFP
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
process this last year and did a lot of
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
research and we have a new contract
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
that's a six-year contract that was
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
signed by governor and Council and
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
approved and we just finished all of
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
that and we have a much better rate of
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
of what we're paying and so what you're
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
seeing is that is the cost of the
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
contract for each year that was recently
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
approved by Governor Council great and
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh do you know cuz I don't know your
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
budget well enough where are the costs
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
that were you know reduced the ones that
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
you used to pay that were increasing all
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
the time CU this goes from zero to this
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
right so where was the stuff that we
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
replaced it should be noted that um we
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
we did have to engage the uh vendor that
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
we getting ready to step away from y uh
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we had to engage
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
the services of the new vendor so that
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
we did not uh in any way interrupt our
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
our operational needs uh so there may be
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit of blip with of increase
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
over the this uh remaining uh budget
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
cycle just it'll reflect paying both
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
those uh vendors and then in the new
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh that uh the old vendor we
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
will no longer be engag so we are
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
overlapping for this entire budget cycle
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
no sir just uh since uh the Inception
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
of uh the new contract and uh when did
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
the old
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
contract June 30th of this
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
year so we we uh we did have to extend a
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
contract that we had with Benchmark I'm
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
completely fine with overlapping because
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
again you cannot flip a switch and flip
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
to the other you got to be safe in
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
transitioning I get that I was just
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
trying to identify you know I see the
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
increases I was looking for the matching
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
decreases and again it can be something
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
that you guys follow up with if uh you
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
know but again when you increase by 200
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
and call it
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
30k and you tell me that hey we were
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
paying way more and we were getting high
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
increases I understand that you're
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
getting additional functionality and
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
therefore you may end up paying more
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
overall and get a better value but I'd
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
like to see where the you know old
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
software being place is dropping from
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
the budget so that I can see how much
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
you really increase or decrease versus
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
the functionality so if we could have
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
that uh you know breakdown provided and
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
if it's not right now in the budget you
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
know tiny forecast of what will happen
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
when once that contract drops off the
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
books yes sir I I'm I guess I'm not
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
understanding where you're seeing 234
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
what what I'm looking at the lines uh 37
 
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.430 align:start position:0%
what what I'm looking at the lines uh 37
and

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
38 um 2
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
25,27 rounded
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
in on page 1183 technology Hardware line
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
3738 under Administration and standards
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
so basically they add up to
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
232 rounded for
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
2026 and I was asking I see the new
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
contract coming in I want you to see
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
where the old contract that you are
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
replacing is and when it will go away so
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can see that if you look at class 24
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
y fy2 adjusted adjusted author
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
authorized was
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
19150 right that was the price of the
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
contract with the current vendor okay so
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
that was the one that we are we are now
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
paying 206 next year for the first year
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the contract with the new vendor I
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
got it so I should look at those two
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
lines combined for now just to
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
understand the totals and the drops and
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
I got it thank you so much yes sir I
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
hope I answered your question no no you
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
did and U it's just there are a lot of
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
little details so um if I may
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
so the next uh one I'm assuming um we
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
have something similar on line 47 on
 
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.549 align:start position:0%
have something similar on line 47 on
line

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
47 hang on I got to line this up
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
correctly line 48 contractual
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
Maintenance building grounds goes from
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
250 yes representative thank you for
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
your question and this is what I had
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to representative Murray
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
earlier which is we have aoral Services
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
contract now okay which was a cost
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
savings from our two full-time positions
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
that we great thank you thank you and
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
we've already covered
 
00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:14.589 align:start position:0%
we've already covered
this

00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
1186 you have
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
equipment uh sorry on line 30 equipment
 
00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:32.270 align:start position:0%
equipment uh sorry on line 30 equipment
new

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
replacement you have a significant
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
amount of expenditures in 2026 it goes
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
from 40,000 in 25 to
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
114 I'm assuming that may be related to
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
but uh representative you may notice
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
that in the actual fiscal 2024 to
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
adjusted 2025 the same kind of I know
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
High first year second I know but it
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be good to understand why the
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
it so it's basically the line where it
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
goes uh as my colleague was pointing out
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
from 92,000 in24 to 1425 then to 114 and
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
then back to
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
24 yes representative thank you for your
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
question so in our efficiency Budget on
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
page 4202 of our efficiency budget
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
request for class 30 equipment The
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
increased funds were needed to replace a
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
recruit training uh utility vehicle for
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
training purposes and then also to put
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
into service our what we call skid car
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
that teaches recruits how to drive a
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle in a skid um and that that is
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
what the increase was for thank you so
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
much and um I'm all said thank you Mr
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
others representative haen Phillips I
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to go back to the um your
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
presentation page two about the form e
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
necessary statutes or rule changes
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
section um does that correlate with our
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
previous discussion about the you know
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
the former Lori list to the to the more
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
updated list through the AG's office or
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
matter uh thank you for the question uh
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
Madam just uh so that I understand
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh the question is related to requesting
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
clarification in definition of policeman
 
00:51:48.640 --> 00:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
clarification in definition of policeman
conduct

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
these were um very minor uh changes
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
under the definition of misconduct uh
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
literally to put the word
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
or in between uh certain sections uh and
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
and did not um really speak uh to any
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
material changes of what police
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
so this is just going to be part of hb2
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion or or is it not included
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
currently and you're asking us to
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
include it I guess I'm
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
confused I apologize I do not uh have uh
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
the level of knowledge to understand
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we're talking about uh
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
some of the pathways but in essence uh
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
that is uh an hb2 amendment uh just to
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
words what you're requesting of us it
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
the governor did not include it into hb2
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the only item in the
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
governor's trailer bill is relative to
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
the details that we talked about the
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
this section is not I do see it in the
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh submission for the the necessary rule
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
changes statute changes from the agency
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
phase but it does not appear the
 
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.150 align:start position:0%
phase but it does not appear the
government

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
put those in her trailer Bill nor I
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't think those are covered in 777 or
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
778 so and you're making note of that as
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
well and and that would be up to a
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
member of this I know it's up to us but
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
are you making a note of it so we can so
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'll remember sure if you yeah if you
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to uh ask the uh Council or uh
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
others for language specific to what
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking for here we could draft
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment to
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
consider can you provide that language I
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
think it is in their agency budget
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
request so we could probably pull from
 
00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:57.630 align:start position:0%
request so we could probably pull from
that

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative hacken
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
continue you have another
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
question are there others I think under
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
the requested government uh Governor's
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
recommended budget um there seem to be
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
other items there that you were looking
 
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
for as to make an amendment for hb2 um
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
all those line
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
changes this part Mickey
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes page three so this requested change
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the governor's recommended budget
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be in section one of house bill
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
one so this is where uh they are
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
requesting to unfund a position so we
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
would reduce class 10 class 60
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
Associated costs with that position and
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
put all that in transfers to di doit so
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
they could fund the position there so I
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
do have a question about that I did
 
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on there um
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
did you request this during the governor
 
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.549 align:start position:0%
did you request this during the governor
phase

00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
phase
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
I think that uh initially we did and
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
then uh we spoke with uh the
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the uh
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
doit and
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh he suggested that we uh pursue uh
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
this pathway instead uh to to fill that
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
position we were initially going to hire
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
just a a person to come in and do it
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
work and uh commissioner goule felt it
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
was more important to make sure that
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
that person was uh part of
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
doit uh so that they could kind of speak
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
hand in glove with regard to State
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
security issues and and um uh making
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
sure that that they're working within
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
the framework of what doit uh wanted
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
them to do so essentially the governor's
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
budget director never heard about this
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing we may have missed the window
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
for that and and in fact that is correct
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
the okay yes just want to understand
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
what was what was happening there thank
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
other I guess I'm I'm just wanting to I
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
think you know the your these little
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
formal requests are reasonable um I'm
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what do you need
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
from us with regards to amendments um to
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
address some of these
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
things can I answer that so I'll work I
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'll work with the police than so they
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
they do have uh some uh statutory
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
requests here most of which are covered
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 778 and 777 which like I
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
said have passed I'll work with police
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
standards to come up with an amendment
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
that would cover everything else for the
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
committee to consider at a later
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
sir re
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and again
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I was looking at your uh
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
personal service uh temporary appointed
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh lines all over and um for the lack of
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
a better word they're a bit lumpy if you
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
look at on page
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
1186 every one of these will be line 050
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
because that's what the temporary
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
Personnel is you have basically a big
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
increase in 2025 and every every other
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
year is about 200 something thousand
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
less and I looked at all the other lines
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
to see if you guys are moving people
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
around and uh the only change that I see
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
that's comparable in size is on page
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
1183 where you are
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
increasing that
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
line in the new budget year but it's
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
only an increase of about 50 or
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
something oh sorry never mind I you're
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
increasing it by about 100 so can you
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
help me understand I know that you were
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking earlier about the need to run a
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
bunch ofies because you had a lot of uh
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
you know vacancies and you needed to
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
train way more officers than usual is
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
that related to that what you know what
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
gives because again when a line goes
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
from 445 to 675 and then back to 455 and
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
472 again that's on page 1186 line
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
050 I think it's worth understanding
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
on I don't think we have the same page
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
number as you do so I'm working on it
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
it's in your um hang on I'll give you
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
the exact numbers it's
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
0687 so it's
 
00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.990 align:start position:0%
0687 so it's
87110

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
87110
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
050 page number in my big book is
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
1186 but again page numbers in the big
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
help right it's temporary staff for the
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
unit yeah instead of numbers I could
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
have also told you the words sorry
 
00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:15.470 align:start position:0%
have also told you the words sorry
former

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
accountant you'll see that again it's
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
445 in 2024
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
675 in 25 and then it drops back to 456
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
years I know but transfers transfers
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
would have to more or less match
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
MoneyWise this is more than transfers
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
one possibility just keep in mind that
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
actual 24 is actually what was spent not
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount okay and when that
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
happens um 25 adjusted authorized the
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
leftover from 24 can actually flow into
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
the 25 adjusted authoriz and correct me
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong this Mickey but um you can't
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
just look at those as the budgeted the
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
original budgeted amounts that is that
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
is correct for adjusted authorized if if
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
non-aps uh account it could carry into
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
the following year plus remember uh 25
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized may also include any
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
transfers that they made at fiscal or
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
any additional money that was accepted
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
or or moved from from elsewhere uh like
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
the employee pay raise that happened two
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
years ago would have been something
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
added onto this when you compare the
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
last budget I understand it's something
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that may not be answerable right now but
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
some details I believe what you may be
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
seeing is we were allocated some funding
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this bium for
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
part-time court security officer salary
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
50 which we would no longer have so I
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
think we we had a bump in and it was uh
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated through the banum from year
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
to year to to non-lps but then will
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
lapse so that may be what you're seeing
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
as we were given some funding to start
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
that security program sounds like it
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
would explain some of it thank you and
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
if we could just you know look into it
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
and follow up just to make sure we
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand again I understand that a lot
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
of these questions require you to go
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
back and crunch numbers and uh you know
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
see exactly what's going on and I would
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate I appreciate the you know
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
work you'll have to put into it but we
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
really need to understand what's going
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
on it's a tough budget year and we
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
really need to look at every U little
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
sir okay I have a few questions
 
01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:41.470 align:start position:0%
sir okay I have a few questions
good

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
here you talked about the part-time
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
training classes potentially being
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
eliminated if I understood
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
your conversation accurately and my
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
question there is what savings would
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
to it's
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
indeterminable only because
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh I would I would have to we would have
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
to sit down and kind of peel back the
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
onion a little bit to see how many of
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
those classes during that part-time
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
academ are taught specifically by our
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
people uh as opposed to uh pulling in
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
volunteers to come in and teach portions
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
of that uh we would also need to look at
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
um uh those resources that we're using
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
to include the firing range the driving
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
pad uh and and any other uh kind of
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
expendable uh costs uh that would be
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
related to to uh that
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
program could you do that just um really
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for is order of
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
magnitude not necessarily down to the
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
penny kind of thing sure I'm just to
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
give an idea of what what savings might
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
generate and if you want to follow up
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
when you're doing that with in terms of
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
the pros and cons as you were starting
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
to express them here in terms of it
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
sounded like you were leaning towards
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you would consider um reducing
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
that eliminating that I should
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
say and if I misunderstood that please
 
01:03:22.839 --> 01:03:24.029 align:start position:0%
say and if I misunderstood that please
correct

01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
me oh no sir chair the uh uh that is
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
very much a discussion that needs to be
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
had uh among the council members and uh
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
the council would ultimately determine
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
whether that program should continue or
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
not okay um you we also I believe as on
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
M you talked about the crisis training
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
and you talked about a special non-aps
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
fund I'm guessing that's a dedicated
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
fund that is correct can you provide us
 
01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:52.549 align:start position:0%
fund that is correct can you provide us
with

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
no I apologize absolutely go ahead it
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
was it was I wish I had the RSA in front
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah it was continuously appropriated
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
Mickey it was Senate Bill 376 from 2022
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
that appropriated $1.1 million when it
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
established the crisis intervention
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
training that appropriation 1.1 million
 
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.829 align:start position:0%
training that appropriation 1.1 million
was

01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
non-aps what last budget we also
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the operating budget
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
another $1.1 million in 24 and in
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
25 I would not say that those
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are non-aps but I feel
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's been that way so we would
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
want to I just want to confirm that with
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
admin services and police standards
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
whatever Direction This committee wants
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
to go in um we would clarifi I I would
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
suggest we clarify those Appropriations
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
whether they're lapsing or
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
non-aps could you also clarify how if we
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't call it a dedicated fund it's got
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
to be somewhere
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
and it is it's carried in that account
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
as just Balan forward essentially it's
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
just I would I'm not necessarily sure
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
what was appropriated in house bill one
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
last bium should have carried forward or
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
if it should have lapsed I get it I just
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll work with I can work with
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
police standards on that and then um and
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
I would say if it's the intention of
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
police standards to carry out that
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
program for the next two years they
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
could use that fund those funds that are
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
available without having to appropriate
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
more money as you can see in the
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget there's not more money
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
added but it it appears to me like there
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
is money available for them to carry
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
forward for the next bium and and maybe
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
they could speak more on that and if I
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
may I believe there's approximately
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
800,000 left in the non-aps funds that
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
we could use to continue the CIT
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
program for what the statute laid out
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
which was one person from each agency
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement costs associated with
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
you and as a
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
if if I may chair uh as a practical
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
matter it's important to also recognize
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
that uh while we provide the CIT
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
training to get that Staffing the way
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to uh be addressing
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
through legislation uh we also have
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issues and so
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
we might put somebody through that
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
training for that police department and
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
then they leave the business and so
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
where uh it's there's never a time where
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
we can check the box and say okay we've
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually you know succeeded in uh the
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislator's uh mandate uh because we're
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're just kind of chasing our tail to
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
to provide that training as needed uh
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing that people are retiring or
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
business so there is as I understand it
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't know they are say in front
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
of me a
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
$100,000 amount I think annually but
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it's by anually from the asset
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund are you familiar with
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
this could you speak to that and so we
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
were mandated by uh the
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
legislature to uh provide a funding
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
source uh to uh reimburse police
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
agencies to subject new police officers
 
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.829 align:start position:0%
agencies to subject new police officers
to

01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
psychological uh testing screening to
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are uh not
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
exhibiting uh psychological issues that
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from working in law
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh many agencies that were
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
not State agencies at the time the the
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the statute basically said if you work
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
for a state law enforcement
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
agency you shall uh have a ssite test
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
and we strongly recommend if you work
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
for a municipal or County agency that
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
you get a sitech test because that kind
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
of turned into an unfunded mandate there
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
was a lot of agencies that just could
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
not cover the cost of making sure that
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
um uh they were getting screened
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
psychologically and so ultimately uh
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
that carve out that came from the AG's
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
office the the uh asset forfeiture
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
account uh is specifically used to
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
provide reimbursement to any police
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
agency in the State uh to cover the cost
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
of the psychological screening which is
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
now mandated in RSA
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
106l so just to clarify so specifically
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
to nonstate
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
entities that is correct sir thank you
 
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
entities that is correct sir thank you
very

01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
much okay any
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
other questions comments
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
any other comments you all would like to
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
make we would just like to thank all of
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
you for for your time and letting us uh
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know present our our situation
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
here well thank you both very much
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're we definitely gave you a lot of
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
questions and you guys are very good to
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
handle them as well as you did so we
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that oh yes of course you do
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray go ahead but but
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's a fun
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
one where do our people go for canine
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
training because you don't do the
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
training here and I'm just C I'm just
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just I find the whole thing
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
fascinating so I have all these little
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
questions I like so where do they go for
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
K9 uh so uh a lot of can9 units in the
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh will uh
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
participate in uh what they call npac uh
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
training and nesac is the Northern New
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
England State Police uh Network and so
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of Municipal uh K9 units will
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
you know maybe travel to Massachusetts
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
to go through their program Boston has a
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
very very strong can9 program as well
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
and um and there is a state Association
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
of can9 officers uh and and uh they also
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
put on training as well so um it's a
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous uh training it's very
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
esoteric you know you really have to be
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
a be a can9 Handler to be able to
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
deliver that kind of training have that
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
that expertise to to uh train others uh
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
and candidly that's that's outside of
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
our bandwidth we just don't have that I
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
time maybe you shouldn't
 
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.669 align:start position:0%
time maybe you shouldn't
self-incriminate

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
here so that's we going to follow up on
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
the asset forer thing is that $100,000 a
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
year a bium that's $100,000 uh per year

the uh testing yeah yes that is in uh
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 106 L sh I believe it's

RSA 106 L sh I believe it's
four

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it's
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
four chapter four and it speaks directly
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
oh go
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
nck I wait we'll wait for you take your
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
time so we have uh three bills with one
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment this afternoon at one yes okay
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's the plan yes I'm actually uh I
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
didn't speak with Eileen I had spoken
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
with well at least
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
with with representative hacken phis but
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
also with Kate with representative
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
Murray um regarding 677 which is the EP
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
pen Bill uh there's an amendment which I
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
sent out um we'll get a slightly
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
modified version of that and both Erica
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
Leon representative Lon and
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Drago thank you um
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
will be here to um describe it it is a
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
bill to pass on consent and I think
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
we'll understand from them that it
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't cost anything to any of the
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
locals which would mean I would think if
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
we all agree that we could just pass it
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
right on through and and and not have to
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
worry about it
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
um another bill that that I believe I
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
spoke them both about um was a a Judy
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
Aron bill which we passed last term that
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
allocated 25,000 didn't allocate allowed
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
a community to Quest up to $25,000 in
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
catastrophic G if you will that sort of
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
thing and that is now law and this bill
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
increases that threshold to $100,000 but
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
you may have also noticed that the it's
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
not a general funds bill it's a specific
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
fund Bill and that fund has $40,000 on
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
it so it's not really hit to our general
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
funds and I'm inclined if you all agree
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
to just also let that pass through and
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
see where it goes the fund has 40,000 in
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
it now correct so it's we tough to get
 
01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
it now correct so it's we tough to get
to

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
100 so at some point I'm sure they'll
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
come back for more money but for now
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is and the third one um I can't
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
remember what it's about but my thinking
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
is to retain it and talk about it when
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
we actually get to the budget that's
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank you the the young the youth the
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
youth transition thing yeah exact well
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
the other two have just rather soon get
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
out of here that's okay oh yeah fine
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
pass them through okay and they just
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
keep the retain the one that's about the
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license so heads up when you
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
talk about I'm not asking for
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
commitments I just want to tell you
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
where I'm
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
headed good then I will um adjourn the
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
1113 maybe we should hold on until
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
Mickey comes back before officially
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%

03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill unless the amount was lowered to
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
25,000 so it was agreed upon that we
 
03:09:09.309 --> 03:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
would settle for a severe reduction in
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of Grant in order to get
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
language signed into law that would
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
provide for a statutory vehicle for the
 
03:09:18.910 --> 03:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
state to get money to municipality in
 
03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
need in an expedient
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
manner I'm simply asking with this bill
 
03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
that the original $100,000 Grant amount
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
be reestablished because we all know
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
that $25,000 is hardly disaster relief
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
to any Community it barely helps at all
 
03:09:39.870 --> 03:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
to pay to fix roads temporarily or to be
 
03:09:42.349 --> 03:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
used to help to get community running
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
again after severe flooding or other
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
natural disasters hit the the bill also
 
03:09:50.229 --> 03:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
corrects some language that Homeland
 
03:09:53.070 --> 03:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management suggested
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
so that it is clear that disaster relief
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
funding received by this grant program
 
03:10:00.830 --> 03:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
only applies to this program and is not
 
03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
confused with any other disaster relief
 
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
funding that a municipality may
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
specifically happens on line five in the
 
03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:17.950 align:start position:0%
specifically happens on line five in the
bill

03:10:17.950 --> 03:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
where it says in grant money quote from
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:28.750 --> 03:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
year um this is very important change to
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
this language this language needs to be
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
changed and it needs to be passed so
 
03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
some of you know that I've been working
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
on this legislation since severe
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
flooding hit aworth and other towns in
 
03:10:44.429 --> 03:10:44.439 align:start position:0%
the state in July 2021 and again in July
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
2023 many towns experience flooding due
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
to heavy rains and just so you know the
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
bills that we have passed already in
 
03:10:56.429 --> 03:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
2022 and 2023 for disaster relief loans
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
s SP 409 and the state share of payment
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
on non- FEMA reimbursable expenditures s
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
sp402 have not even been accessible or
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
functional to our
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities let's not leave this work
 
03:11:13.150 --> 03:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
undone for another year if a disaster
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
hits we as a state need to be prepared
 
03:11:18.429 --> 03:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
to help our municipal ities and give
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
them quick and useful tools to be able
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
to make roads passable and deal with the
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies especially if they do not
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
have the financial resources available
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
I've also provided additional
 
03:11:35.550 --> 03:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
information regarding problems with S SP
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
402 and S SP
 
03:11:40.349 --> 03:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
409 um I have a packet to hand out to
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
everybody if you if you'd be so kind
 
03:11:47.910 --> 03:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
which includes um the testimony and also
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh background information about where we
 
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
are with S sp42 and S sp49 I also
 
03:11:57.070 --> 03:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
provided the committee with a packet of
 
03:11:59.790 --> 03:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
information that was a a report that was
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
done by the Pew um Foundation about how
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
States pay for disaster relief it's a
 
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
very interesting read and unfortunately
 
03:12:10.830 --> 03:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is
 
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
woefully behind in what we ought to be
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
doing to help our municipal ities should
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
a disaster strike and that's all I have
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
questions there any questions sure go
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
ahead um for the record just um so you
 
03:12:33.229 --> 03:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
know to make sure we all understand a
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the history can
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
you speak to I think two things one is
 
03:12:39.870 --> 03:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
that your town was pretty much left to
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
or towns are left to their own resources
 
03:12:45.190 --> 03:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
here because they're not state roads
 
03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a difference between what
 
03:12:48.269 --> 03:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
the state do with the state road but
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
where a town is left to its own devices
 
03:12:52.110 --> 03:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
correct and also can you all go over
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
just you know very briefly uh I remember
 
03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
we're concerned last time about how this
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
would potentially have a negative impact
 
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
on your ability to get FEMA funds can
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
you just give us the narrative to say
 
03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
how you're protected from you know some
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the FEMA issues correct
 
03:13:12.309 --> 03:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay so let my town is still struggling
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
to get roads fixed I have a bridge
 
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's a bridge at the
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
on one on Forest Road um it's a
 
03:13:21.279 --> 03:13:22.469 align:start position:0%
on one on Forest Road um it's a
municipal

03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
bridge that bridge was damaged in 2023
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
flooding we won't get that bridge fixed
 
03:13:28.399 --> 03:13:29.309 align:start position:0%
flooding we won't get that bridge fixed
until

03:13:29.309 --> 03:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
until
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
2027 so that thoroughfare is out so just
 
03:13:36.670 --> 03:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
to put it in context I mean there are
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
roads in our town that are still unable
 
03:13:44.469 --> 03:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
to be repaired uh in an expedient Manner
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
and try as we may to you know put money
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
aside if you don't have the tax base to
 
03:13:54.030 --> 03:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
deal with it it's a problem if you have
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
a smaller town um that the tax base
 
03:13:59.229 --> 03:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
already struggles with just maintaining
 
03:14:03.990 --> 03:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.710 --> 03:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
have so so there is a problem with our
 
03:14:10.389 --> 03:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities being able to
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
recover and absorb the costs of these
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
devastating floods and natural
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
disasters and so far as um money given
 
03:14:22.990 --> 03:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
to the town as a grant and how that may
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
or may not interfere with FEMA funding I
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
know that there have been um you know
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
rules are being looked at in FEMA to be
 
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
able to make some
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
exceptions um they are um you know we
 
03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
have an instance where now the town has
 
03:14:45.790 --> 03:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
we have on our Warren articles coming up
 
03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
in aworth um where FEMA has said okay
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
well um we have Ro we have money that's
 
03:14:56.150 --> 03:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
been appropriated and set aside for this
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
particular repair but we know that this
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
other repair is something that's more of
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
a priority and we just need permission
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
from your town to be able to move those
 
03:15:09.150 --> 03:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
funds so so you can see that FEMA is
 
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much um you know they're they're
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
willing to work with a community to be
 
03:15:18.910 --> 03:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
able to um move funds where it needs to
 
03:15:21.670 --> 03:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
be done and I think that you know even
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
if you receive grant money for uh
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
certain temporary repairs that those
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
temporary repairs may be something that
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
the town can absorb and wouldn't need
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
FEMA to um to come in and and and do a
 
03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
project on um so I don't I don't think
 
03:15:42.229 --> 03:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
that it would really necessarily
 
03:15:45.229 --> 03:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
interfere with any money that a town uh
 
03:15:50.110 --> 03:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:15:55.630 --> 03:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
else on hacking Phillips yeah thank you
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative Aaron
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
for being with us today um I'm looking
 
03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note um for the for the
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
bill and um just not noting here for the
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
record that the current balance as of
 
03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2024 for the two funds that
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
might be applicable to this
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh so the New Hampshire emergency
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
response Recovery Fund is currently a
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
zero balance and the New Hampshire
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
disaster relief F fund will be
 
03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
4,292 and there are no Appropriations
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
currently included in the bill could you
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
speak to the maybe future impact that
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
this bill could have sure um so in many
 
03:16:40.910 --> 03:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
discussions that I've had with chairman
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
Wier um he indicated to me that because
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the way this is set up that a town a
 
03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
municipality can come to fiscal
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee and request certain funding
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
that the money doesn't have to be parked
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
in a fund anywhere that if when a
 
03:17:00.469 --> 03:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
municipality comes to fiscal and makes a
 
03:17:04.189 --> 03:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
Rec request that what fiscal can do is
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
then say oh well do we have any
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
unappropriated funds somewhere or can we
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
take money out of the rainy day fund to
 
03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
satisfy a request and again a request
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be from fiscal committee
 
03:17:20.710 --> 03:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
$100,000 it can be a partial amount of
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
what the municipality is seeking so but
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
what he indicated to me was that instead
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
of having money specifically earmarked
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
and parked into a fund that the fiscal
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee could move funds around to
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
satisfy a request that that a town comes
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to it
 
03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
with just to be clear the fiscal
 
03:17:45.630 --> 03:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee definitely cannot take money
 
03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
out of the r to day fund okay I'm pretty
 
03:17:50.469 --> 03:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
certain of that um and as far as moving
 
03:17:53.070 --> 03:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
funds around I guess that might depend
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the situation sure Micky so I can
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
clarify and the department can speak to
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
this too when they come up what
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron referred to earlier
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
as far as the assistance for
 
03:18:06.670 --> 03:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
municipality to apply for a half of the
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
nonfederal match or the non-federal
 
03:18:11.309 --> 03:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
portion of FEMA there is an open warrant
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
and statute for that uh relative to uh
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
RSA but not to the r day fund to the
 
03:18:19.469 --> 03:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
general fund to the general fund correct
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh under RSA 21p 37e this additional
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
disaster relief that this this is
 
03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
looking to increase from 25 to 100,000
 
03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
this would come from that disaster fund
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's identified in 21p 46 and 46a
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's no open warrant for those funds
 
03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
those would be subject to just whatever
 
03:18:38.030 --> 03:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
they have available and that's the
 
03:18:41.790 --> 03:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
$45,000 so there I I don't see a a
 
03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:43.229 align:start position:0%
$45,000 so there I I don't see a a
mechanism

03:18:43.229 --> 03:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
to get additional General funds drawn
 
03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
for this purpose and the department can
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
speak to that or if I'm misinterpreting
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.469 --> 03:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
it so what I was under the understanding
 
03:18:59.479 --> 03:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
it so what I was under the understanding
was

03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:19:04.030 --> 03:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
that um from speaking with represent uh
 
03:19:06.870 --> 03:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Wier was that monies could be
 
03:19:10.510 --> 03:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
moved around if need be in a disaster
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
where as prior to this language being in
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
statute there was absolutely no statut
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism at all for the state to be
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
able to give money to a municipality so
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's kind of why why we did
 
03:19:27.550 --> 03:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
03:19:29.550 --> 03:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else wanted to
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
speak to I yes one other thing I also
 
03:19:36.750 --> 03:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
did want to say about um the language
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
that was passed for the 50% match
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
is that those have not even the rules
 
03:19:45.870 --> 03:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
for that M that program have not even
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
gotten in gotten established and so I
 
03:19:51.389 --> 03:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
mean my town is still waiting for the
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
rules to be established they're waiting
 
03:19:54.389 --> 03:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
for up to
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
$200,000 in funds to be released from
 
03:19:57.720 --> 03:19:58.469 align:start position:0%
$200,000 in funds to be released from
the

03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
state for that
 
03:20:03.389 --> 03:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
program and the department is here to
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
speak to that I think it is still in the
 
03:20:06.309 --> 03:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
rulem process and they could probably
 
03:20:08.590 --> 03:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
update the committee on
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
sure so who is here from the department
 
03:20:18.830 --> 03:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
who wants
 
03:20:24.910 --> 03:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire please go ahead my my only
 
03:20:42.830 --> 03:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
comment is regarding the 50% match that
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
is still in Ru making uh and it is with
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
legal so we're in the process of
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
developing the rules regarding this
 
03:20:51.030 --> 03:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation particularly we
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a position uh one way or the
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
other thank you any questions from the
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
committee represent papovich if I may
 
03:21:01.550 --> 03:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
just because I'm not aware of the
 
03:21:04.349 --> 03:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
timelines of that do you have any idea
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
how long will it take until the rules
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
will be finalized and relief can be
 
03:21:10.030 --> 03:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
provided I Know It's tricky to answer
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
those questions but any kind of ballpark
 
03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the rule set is in draft form
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's with the Department of Safety legal
 
03:21:17.070 --> 03:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
team right now
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
once it comes from there then it'll go
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearing any other questions I don't know
 
03:21:28.110 --> 03:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
what the time the date would be on that
 
03:21:31.389 --> 03:21:31.399 align:start position:0%

to create a temporary traditional
 
03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license for youth operators
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%

03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you very very much Mr
 
03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you committee for
 
03:24:14.349 --> 03:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
listening uh my name is Stephanie grund
 
03:24:17.189 --> 03:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro 34 from Amherst
 
03:24:19.469 --> 03:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm here for representative veu who
 
03:24:22.110 --> 03:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately in London on vacation
 
03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
with his
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
family um but under current law the
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
youth operators face um some unne
 
03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary challenges um approaching
 
03:24:32.429 --> 03:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
their 21st birthday in particular if
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
their birthday falls on a weekend
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
holiday um or if they want to renew
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
their license
 
03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
online uh youth operators who wish to
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
renew online receive a horizontal
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
license must also wait until their 21st
 
03:24:45.910 --> 03:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
birthday to do so if they renew even one
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
day early they receive a vertical
 
03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
license and they face the same
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
inconvenience of returning to the DMV
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
later additionally renewing online
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
involves a waiting period while the
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
license is printed and mailed leaving
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
drivers without legal proof of renewal
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
at that
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
time the inefficient process wastes time
 
03:25:07.349 --> 03:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
for drivers and increases the workload
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
for the DMV staff this bill provides a
 
03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
simple and practical solution it allows
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
youth operators submit their renewal
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
application up to 30 days before their
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
21st birthday and they receive a
 
03:25:21.550 --> 03:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
temporary license that's valid for
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
driving purposes this temporary license
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
ensures they can transition seamlessly
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the standard horizontal license on or
 
03:25:31.229 --> 03:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
shortly after their birthday regardless
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
of whether their birthday falls on a
 
03:25:35.670 --> 03:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
weekday weekend or a holiday so first
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
the bill eliminates unnecessary trips to
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
the DMV drivers can submit their
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
application online and they receive the
 
03:25:44.189 --> 03:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
license they prefer saving time and
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
frustration second it reduces the burden
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the DMV staff by cutting down on
 
03:25:51.189 --> 03:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
duplicate license requests making
 
03:25:54.030 --> 03:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
operations more efficient and third it
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
costs it's there was a cost-effective
 
03:25:58.110 --> 03:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
solution the one-time system update will
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
cost approximately
 
03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
$48,000 and it'll streamline the process
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
for years years to come so uh that's a
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
quick brief introduction and I'm happy
 
03:26:10.990 --> 03:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
to try and answer any questions and I
 
03:26:12.670 --> 03:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
know there's the DMV staff who's here to
 
03:26:14.910 --> 03:26:14.920 align:start position:0%

the
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
DMV want to thank uh representative
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
grund for that overview was fantastic um
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
it covers uh why this bill is so
 
03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
important and we want to recognize
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Vu for uh working to make
 
03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
this happen uh towards the end of last
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
session we had a sidebar conversation he
 
03:27:30.790 --> 03:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
asked about this he wanted to come up
 
03:27:32.590 --> 03:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
with a solution for it I can tell you
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
internally at the DMV um this has been a
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation for many years
 
03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 and I can tell you that
 
03:27:41.189 --> 03:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
being in this position for the last
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
three I've had more people in the
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
community that have come up and asked
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
about why did we do what your renewal
 
03:27:49.229 --> 03:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
notice asks us to do which is renew
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
early um to get your license and then
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
when you do that if you have the youth
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
operator you're mailed the youth
 
03:27:57.790 --> 03:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
operator license and that requires you
 
03:27:59.710 --> 03:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
now to make an appointment to go to the
 
03:28:02.670 --> 03:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
DMV to pay $10 for a duplicate license
 
03:28:04.349 --> 03:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
and nobody wanted the duplicate and
 
03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
yellow on the license as well um so
 
03:28:09.790 --> 03:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
everything representative grunt said is
 
03:28:12.269 --> 03:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh is exactly what the issue is so now
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
there's a path forward that you can
 
03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
renew your license early if you're
 
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
transition positioning from the youth
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
operator to the horizontal license being
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
over AG 21 and not be impacted if it
 
03:28:25.070 --> 03:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
happens to fall on a weekend or if you
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
come in one day early to do that and
 
03:28:29.070 --> 03:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for a long time and
 
03:28:31.229 --> 03:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly that's affected thousands
 
03:28:34.110 --> 03:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
probably tens of thousands of people uh
 
03:28:36.990 --> 03:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
definitely over the last uh 15 years
 
03:28:38.670 --> 03:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
that have been inconvenience with that
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
I've talked to some people that renewed
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
online got the youth operator in the
 
03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
mail and never came back in to get the
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
horizontal license and just kept it for
 
03:28:49.389 --> 03:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
another 5 years and that's not
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate um they deserve the
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
horizontal license at that point they're
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
21 years old so it sounds like you
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
support this 100 100% sir it's a great
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I couldn't couldn't say enough
 
03:29:02.590 --> 03:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
about it and I think the way that it's
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
structured again with the uh the grace
 
03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
period uh in the beginning the grace
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
period for the license after um and what
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
Jen I want to recognize Jen for doing a
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
great job on the fiscal note as always
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
and also looking at um the technology
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
changes to hold the queue so basically
 
03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
until you turn 21 midnight that night
 
03:29:24.750 --> 03:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's when that goes to the system and
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
the hard copy horizontal license is
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
printed and mailed but you still have
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
the 30-day overlap so that you're still
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
in good standing so it's a it's a great
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair and again thank
 
03:29:38.349 --> 03:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
you for being here and I appreciate the
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
efforts put into this
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill not having spent a lot of time
 
03:29:45.630 --> 03:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
thinking in this space uh why do we even
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
ask people to apply for a horizontal
 
03:29:49.189 --> 03:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
license when they turn
 
03:29:52.590 --> 03:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
21 I mean seriously couldn't they just
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
automatically get the horizontal one or
 
03:29:56.229 --> 03:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
get an email that
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
hey you need to drop off your vertical
 
03:30:00.910 --> 03:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
to get your horizontal just come to the
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
DMV and it's already waiting for you I'm
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand obviously this
 
03:30:07.269 --> 03:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
is an improvement yeah my question I
 
03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
guess is why don't we improve it even
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
more and save even more time and
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
effort yes um so currently the way the
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
law is written is you have to have a
 
03:30:20.110 --> 03:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
youth operator or a vertical license
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
until your age of 21 um so you have to
 
03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
carry that until you're that age that's
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
why we're having this situation where
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're renewing on a weekend many of
 
03:30:31.150 --> 03:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
them the the the one complaint we hear
 
03:30:33.070 --> 03:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
is they want to go out to the bar on
 
03:30:36.710 --> 03:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
their 21st birthday and a bar won't take
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
an expired license to serve you alcohol
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
or so that's that's the whole reasoning
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
behind is it gives them a way to have a
 
03:30:45.429 --> 03:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
valid license to go out on their birth
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
date but then they don't have to then
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
use a under 21 vertical license for five
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
additional years into their 20s
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
understood but do all the vertical
 
03:30:59.710 --> 03:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
licenses automatically expire when uh
 
03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
people reach the right
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
age okay so okay I think that clarifies
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
my confusion here yeah you your first
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
original license if you're under the age
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
of 21 expires on your 21st birthday it's
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
pro-rated thank you I got here when I
 
03:31:20.349 --> 03:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
was over 21 so uh thank you
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
sir other questions from the
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee so just one thing I want to
 
03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
confirm um there is no appropriation so
 
03:31:30.429 --> 03:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
can I assume that you all are willing to
 
03:31:33.070 --> 03:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
include that just do this on your own we
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
did look at that sir and um for for the
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
one-time cost uh we would find the money
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
in our budget to handle it that is such
 
03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
great news yeah yeah yeah thank you very
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
much for that and thank you very much
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
for your testimony if that's all you
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
you no pass yeah and is is there anybody

off all right so the next bill we're
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to consider is HB 677 requiring
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
schools to maintain a supply of EpiPen
 
03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
injectors for use in event of an
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
emergency and I'll representative I'll
 
03:33:57.189 --> 03:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
I'll rep notice rep
 
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
rep here go the names again Drago
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
Drago thank you and please introduce
 
03:34:05.469 --> 03:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
yourself better than I
 
03:34:08.110 --> 03:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
did good afternoon I'm representative
 
03:34:10.750 --> 03:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
Drago I represent the town of R in New
 
03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire HB 677 passed the education
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously unanimously a few
 
03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and then it was on the consent
 
03:34:20.429 --> 03:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
calendar so I won't go into the
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
specifics of the details of the bill but
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
um Everybody kind of recognized that EP
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
pens are necessary in schools so I'm
 
03:34:28.630 --> 03:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
here just to talk about the fiscal
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
impact and as of right now there
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually is no fiscal impact to the
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
state there's multiple programs that
 
03:34:37.630 --> 03:34:37.640 align:start position:0%
actually give these out for free uh to
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
school districts um the old school
 
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
EpiPen uh I think it's called epipens
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
for schools
 
03:34:49.229 --> 03:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
um you you get four free doses the thing
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
about epipens is it comes in um an adult
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
version or it comes in a junior version
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
depends on weight um and what's nice
 
03:34:59.309 --> 03:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
about this program is it has um so it
 
03:35:00.630 --> 03:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
comes in a two pack that's the other
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing about EP pens when you buy and
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
they come in two pack so you get two two
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
packs a year per school so you get to
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
choose or the school nurse would choose
 
03:35:10.590 --> 03:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
depending on demographics of the school
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh you can do two adult two packs two
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
Junior two packs or of each if you
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
happen to be like a middle school where
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
you might have both weight you know
 
03:35:22.510 --> 03:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
weight ratios or whatever the other
 
03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
thing that's nice about this program is
 
03:35:27.389 --> 03:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
if you happen to have to use one during
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
the school year they replace it for free
 
03:35:34.110 --> 03:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
so the school does not have to purchase
 
03:35:37.469 --> 03:35:37.479 align:start position:0%
epinephrine uh the other program in the
 
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
bill we added in uh FDA approved nasal
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
spray FDA just recently approved instead
 
03:35:46.030 --> 03:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
of doing the auto injector you can
 
03:35:50.110 --> 03:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
inhale uh epinephrine and um up to yep
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um that's not in the bill correct the
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
is it's in one
 
03:36:02.830 --> 03:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
spot oh I asked OLS to give either put
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
it in everywhere or just put it in one
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
spot they chose one spot but we have an
 
03:36:08.349 --> 03:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
amendment just to put it after
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lam will'll talk about
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
that in a minute but we're going to add
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
it everywhere it says epinephrine we're
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to say FDA approved okay I see now
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
where you have it in there as well okay
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
um so right now it's called nephy
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't legislate a trade
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
name but
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
um nephie is the nasal spray right now
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
but it's only for 66 pounds and up so it
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't really qualify for Elementary
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
School per se they also offer the same
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
program you get four doses two two packs
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
and they also provide free
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
replenishments if you have the
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstance of having to
 
03:36:41.229 --> 03:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
use one during the school year so
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically schools just get the uh
 
03:36:45.150 --> 03:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
prescription go online you fill out you
 
03:36:48.510 --> 03:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
know account fill it to paperwork and um
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
you get your epinephrine so who covers
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the initial two per year is that the
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
feds it's through it's through a program
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
I I assume I I didn't trace the money
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
back to see if feds put in money or not
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
I assume it's just a good
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
advertising we all saw a few years ago
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
they were charging $600 for epinephrine
 
03:37:09.189 --> 03:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
and it was like you know $2 to make or
 
03:37:11.309 --> 03:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
something my guess is these companies
 
03:37:13.309 --> 03:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
say well it's a tax write off and it
 
03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
gives us good advertising by but I don't
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
really know they might get Kickbacks or
 
03:37:20.550 --> 03:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how that part works okay
 
03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
what you're understanding is that right
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
now the companies essentially provide
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
two per school and if you use one you
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
get you'll get a replac for free as well
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
four yeah there's no question about that
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's no charge for any of that yeah
 
03:37:34.110 --> 03:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
no nope okay yeah well thank you y is is
 
03:37:35.389 --> 03:37:35.399 align:start position:0%
it oh yeah you said it's from the
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
company right that's your understanding
 
03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
yep yep now I don't know if they get
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government that
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter to me
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
no seems to be straight from the M okay
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee okay um are do you have other
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
comments oh no that was that was
 
03:37:58.830 --> 03:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
basically it okay are we waiting for the
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment so I thought we'd hear from
 
03:38:03.150 --> 03:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
okay the the state since they're here
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
while um I believe representative L's
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
literally running over to OS now to get
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes the uh apparently the amendment
 
03:38:10.269 --> 03:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
requesting not go through this morning
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
if it's not here I can pull out the
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
copies that say may instead of shall and
 
03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
we can agree to cross out May take sh
 
03:38:18.189 --> 03:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
and we'll deal with that but um if since
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
the state is here do you all want to
 
03:38:27.990 --> 03:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured so please introduce
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
yourselves and take it away Melissa
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%

03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
so I just would like to have
 
03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:49.750 align:start position:0%
so I just would like to have
clarification

03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:38:51.870 --> 03:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
on where the
 
03:38:54.269 --> 03:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
funding is supposed to be coming from
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not clear in the
 
03:38:57.950 --> 03:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislation how it's written and maybe I
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
need to see the amendment first before
 
03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that'll shed some clarity on it
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
but can you paiz for one
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
so we all have a slightly earlier
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
version of the amendment which he's
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
passing out now which is identical to
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
the one that I believe representative L
 
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
will bring back that replaces one word
 
03:39:34.269 --> 03:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
may we shall but take take your time to
 
03:39:35.630 --> 03:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have to race
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
through it it's a replace all bills so
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do a comparison it's a
 
03:39:42.189 --> 03:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
replace all amendment I
 
03:39:48.189 --> 03:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.150 --> 03:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
were the responsibility for paying for
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
the um product where that lies because
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written it doesn't
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
line seven on page
 
03:40:09.389 --> 03:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
two there's a dollar appropriated to the
 
03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for the purpose
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
of reimbursing school districts for
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining supplies
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the epinephrine Auto
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
injectors so that's not clear that's
 
03:40:23.349 --> 03:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
saying the department the state is
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying for them but then
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's information about we're getting
 
03:40:32.070 --> 03:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
them for free from a company so I just
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
want to point
 
03:40:35.710 --> 03:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
out we might want to
 
03:40:38.670 --> 03:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
clarify who's responsible is it the
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
local level is it this company is it the
 
03:40:43.950 --> 03:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
state for maintaining this Supply
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually I was hoping you were going to
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
clarify this so you're not familiar with
 
03:40:47.160 --> 03:40:47.910 align:start position:0%
clarify this so you're not familiar with
this

03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
program no not the not the program that
 
03:40:53.469 --> 03:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that I'm not aware of that
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
aha that company but it
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
just just just to provide some
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
information I learned three minutes ago
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I was looking for the website for the
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
program and it's EpiPen for you know
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
numeral for
 
03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
schools.com and in the FAQ they say it's
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
a free Nationwide program offered by the
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
marketer and distributor of EP
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
to help you know to provide access and
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
it basically says what the sponsor was
 
03:41:22.149 --> 03:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
describing earlier that every school can
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
get four doses and they will be replaced
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh diffused and so on so it seems that
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
all the school has to do is to apply and
 
03:41:31.950 --> 03:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
show that they have the ability to
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
deliver medication right which every
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire probably has
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
they have a nurse or somebody who can
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
deliver medication and then they would
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
get this free Supply I think I cannot
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
speak for the sponsors but I think the
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
expectation is that that a school
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
applying for this and being rejected
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be a very rare and unusual
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
situation but I'm just guessing and I'm
 
03:41:55.630 --> 03:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
sure we'll have a bit more of a
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
conversation on it but it seems clear
 
03:42:02.349 --> 03:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
that every school who has a you
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
know if you if you have students that
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
have a valid prescription for epipens
 
03:42:10.590 --> 03:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
and so on that they will qualify for
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
this which will supply again the four
 
03:42:16.510 --> 03:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
doses a year and replaced by again just
 
03:42:21.550 --> 03:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
website sorry that's fine uh same I
 
03:42:26.229 --> 03:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
guess think two things so I remember the
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
second one it sounds like this the
 
03:42:30.189 --> 03:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
active agent here is the school in
 
03:42:34.030 --> 03:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
applying to this program and so it seems
 
03:42:35.550 --> 03:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
like it would bypass the Department of
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
Education and would not have an impact
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the Department of Education you can
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
let me know if that's true and the
 
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
second thing
 
03:42:45.630 --> 03:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
um do you have and you may not know this
 
03:42:47.070 --> 03:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
but the people working on the bill and
 
03:42:48.990 --> 03:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's in the fact thing there
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
does the school have to have a student
 
03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
identified as someone who may have an A
 
03:42:56.429 --> 03:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock or can the any school
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
have this regardless of that because you
 
03:43:00.990 --> 03:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
don't always know you know what kids
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
have so I don't know who has the answers
 
03:43:05.590 --> 03:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
to those two questions but those are
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
mine if I may jump in on the second
 
03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
mine if I may jump in on the second
question

03:43:15.510 --> 03:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
if the department is not
 
03:43:19.950 --> 03:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for reimbursing school
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
districts for maintaining supplies
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
then it shouldn't be in the
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislation if it states in there that
 
03:43:29.910 --> 03:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has to
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
reimburse school districts for
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining the supplies and there's a
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriated for it if it passes
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
as written we would not be able to
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
reimburse those schools for maintaining
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
those supplies so I just want to make
 
03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
that clear I don't know if you want to
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
clarify the legislation so it takes out
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
anything about the Department of
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
Education having to reimburse school
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
districts for maintaining the
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
supplies I think we will but I a little
 
03:44:00.910 --> 03:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
concerned um so back on January 6th the
 
03:44:02.149 --> 03:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
dep Department was asked for the fiscal
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
note on this and this bill passed the
 
03:44:06.189 --> 03:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
house on consent so clearly had had a
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
hearing before that did the department
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
not answer these questions prior to that
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
point yes we we did yes yes yes we
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
answered their question about that
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
language we would not we've made them
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
aware we would not be able to I get that
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
concern but did you look into the
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
availability the no cost approach to the
 
03:44:30.030 --> 03:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
whole system it sounds like you're notw
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
W made aware of that no oh okay all
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah representative Mar yeah along
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
the same lines the way this is written
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
if this EP pen program went away then it
 
03:44:46.189 --> 03:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
is it would this mean that uh the
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
schools would maintain the epen EpiPen
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
program and the do Department of
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
Education would then have to pay for the
 
03:44:56.429 --> 03:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
cost of the pens if this free program
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
was dissolved what would happen if the
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
program was dissolved given how this is
 
03:45:02.030 --> 03:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
written based on how it's written that's
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
be any other questions for
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
Department uh yes repr
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
Melly thank you
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
um on line four on first page of the
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill it it says when a nurse is imployed
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
or contracted by the district what if
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
nurse can you clarify where you're
 
03:45:48.189 --> 03:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
reading I think it's line four on page
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
one line oh line 11 I thought I'm Sor
 
03:45:59.870 --> 03:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
four oh I'm
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I'm looking at the wrong
 
03:46:09.750 --> 03:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right yes line 11 when a nurse
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
is employed or contracted by the
 
03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
district so I want to know what if um a
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
school nurse is not
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.189 --> 03:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
district so it's my understanding that
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
they're required to have a school
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
nurse and that if the school nurse is
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
not there then it's the a building
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
administrator that then becomes that
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
kind of fills that
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
role so then my understanding then it
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
would fall upon that
 
03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
administrator that responsibility but I
 
03:46:51.910 --> 03:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
mean it's not it's not in statute it's
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
language other questions from the State
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
State okay thank you very much
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
here nasal spray isn't inconsistent with
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
this and then with my the time that I've
 
03:47:10.510 --> 03:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
been on Jael car and being a medical
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
device analyst I wanted to make sure
 
03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
that um we have the appropriate carrots
 
03:47:16.510 --> 03:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
and SS so that school districts will
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
spend the 15 to 20 minutes to apply for
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
the program um especially because I know
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
the de Nephi in schools when they use it
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is say hey we use
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
this on a student they don't have a
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
prescription and they'll get a new one
 
03:47:30.189 --> 03:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
sent right to them in the mail thank you
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you ma'am appreciate it and
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for rushing the the amendment
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
over I assume the sh is in here now yes
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
prob four it's um online 24 it is now a
 
03:47:50.269 --> 03:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
got it thank you thank
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
you rreo would you like to come back and
 
03:47:59.950 --> 03:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
four uh sure I this is actually the
 
03:48:05.309 --> 03:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
first I heard of a concern about this so
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
I I I actually don't even know the
 
03:48:10.189 --> 03:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
answer to this because I was told by
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
another co-sponsor that we should have a
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
a dollar appropriated just in case
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
a school got denied for some reason if
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
that's not the case then I don't know I
 
03:48:22.030 --> 03:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be an unfunded mandate
 
03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
on the local schools so if a school got
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
denied for some reason yes the state
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
should have to pay for the epinepherine
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
so they said put a dollar in there even
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
though that's highly unlikely and that's
 
03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
why it's there so while I understand
 
03:48:35.950 --> 03:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
that you heard that what the department
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
had to say about
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
this yes they're wondering well they're
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
wondering where the money would be
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
coming from so they're wondering so on
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
on page one I mean you know on the first
 
03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
page when it talked about the department
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
um May adopt rules under this to
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
implement the reimbursement process I
 
03:48:59.469 --> 03:48:59.479 align:start position:0%
assumed it was it was up to them to
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
decide where you know which fund it came
 
03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
out of or how that
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
worked so so your intent is that the
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
state is backing this up and if the free
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
programs end the the state's then
 
03:49:12.269 --> 03:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for this program correct I
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't see the free program ending but
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
yes the state should be backing it up I
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to have another mandate on
 
03:49:19.229 --> 03:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
our local schools okay please understand
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
what that means we certainly can't pass
 
03:49:22.750 --> 03:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
it um it'll be held to go into the
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
budget and it's a very tight budget year
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you're aware um and you're
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
potentially talking about millions of
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.309 --> 03:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
to yeah I mean the policy is more
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
important so honestly taking out that's
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
the appropriation I mean it's probably
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
better just to have the policy um as
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lon said the purpose is
 
03:49:55.469 --> 03:49:55.479 align:start position:0%
is kids can still bring their own EP and
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
Eon to schools the problem is 25% of the
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
times that you have to use it you don't
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
know you had an allergy and so that's
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
why it's needed in schools so I
 
03:50:08.149 --> 03:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
understand that if we just so let's just
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
take that out and yeah I think it would
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
be better that way because then at least
 
03:50:13.870 --> 03:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
we can proceed yeah we'll proceed it as
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
is and if it gets canceled for some
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
reason which I don't see that happening
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
we cross that bridge when we get to it
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
did you have a question M on Bernie
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm you know I'm reasonably
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a language that sort of
 
03:50:29.149 --> 03:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
protects the Department of Education um
 
03:50:30.429 --> 03:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
but I am uncomfortable with they
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
actually being an appropriation because
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
we never know where that goes the other
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
concern I have is that there are those
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who are quite protective and
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
wanting to know a whole lot about what's
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
going on with their kids in schools and
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
what is the potential have you had any
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
push back for the parent who objects to
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
the school providing epinephrine for
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
their child even if it saves the child's
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
life there is you know you can't do this
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
to my child unless you give me 24 hours
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
notice or something there is a group of
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
people who have those views towards some
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
of these things is there any potential
 
03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
that they're being pushed back about a
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
parent saying no you can't do that to my
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
child for whatever crazy reason that you
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm it's extreme but but um you've
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
seen similar things I think yeah I don't
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
know I that was not asked during the
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
education hearing
 
03:51:27.229 --> 03:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I do see how some parents you know
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't want extra things done to their
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
kids without having the notice first I I
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
would equate this to using an ad on a
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
child but it's a life-saving measure um
 
03:51:39.269 --> 03:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
in situations like this you probably
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
just ask for forgiveness later and make
 
03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
repres papich thank you uh just a quick
 
03:51:51.389 --> 03:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
comment on what was just said when
 
03:51:54.269 --> 03:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
you're having somebody who's at risk of
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
losing their life on the spot which is
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
something that this is meant to
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
save consent I mean if if you if you get
 
03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
an ambulance to pick you up and you're
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
unconscious you don't they don't need
 
03:52:06.189 --> 03:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
consent to treat you they are saving
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
your life you'll figure out the rest
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
after so I understand the importance of
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
respecting parents rights and whatnot
 
03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to life and or death
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
situations at some point you got to do
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
what you got to do um my my question was
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
really from earlier if we remove section
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
four about the appropriation right what
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
are we going to do about the rest of
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh Roman numeral six because
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
it says shall reimburse I mean if we say
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
shall reimburse and I don't have an
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation I don't think you can just
 
03:52:43.469 --> 03:52:43.479 align:start position:0%
take Roman numeral 6 number four out I
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
think you kind of have to take the
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
entire Roman numeral six
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
out I'm not saying it's a good idea I'm
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
just saying they seem to go together so
 
03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is something that I want
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
reprentative I had the same concern and
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
um I think my recommendation to the
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors would be to maybe spend a
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
little more time on that concern if they
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
want us to move forward we might need to
 
03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
recess this work session for another day
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
so that they have a little more time to
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
concern representative Lon uh thank you
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
if I may I've actually worked closely
 
03:53:25.830 --> 03:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
with the parents who are very concerned
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
about um Medical Care in the schools
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't approve they never had
 
03:53:34.189 --> 03:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
any concern about immediate life-saving
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
care and that's one of the places where
 
03:53:38.189 --> 03:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
the parents got Twisted into pretzels
 
03:53:39.870 --> 03:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
because they were given forms where they
 
03:53:41.309 --> 03:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
had to consent to anything and
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
everything under the sun or deny even
 
03:53:46.870 --> 03:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
immediate life-saving care um for a
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
rescue or for an ambulance or even for
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
taking a temperature to see what the
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
child's temperature was um I think it's
 
03:53:55.469 --> 03:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate that you haven't been
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the Health and Human Services
 
03:53:58.149 --> 03:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
committee meetings when we have been
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
discussing it and you've only been
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
hearing the commentary from outside I
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
want you to rest assured that none of
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
these parent rights or parent privacy or
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
medical privacy groups ever seek to
 
03:54:10.990 --> 03:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with something like rescuing a
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
if I
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
yes on pop it sorry thank you if if we I
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask the committee if we
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
are going to ask the sponsors to work on
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
the bill a bit more to maybe clarify
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what the committee would be
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
looking to receive from them or what
 
03:54:38.429 --> 03:54:38.439 align:start position:0%
what would it take to get there
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
because I I you know if I was the
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I didn't have a clear idea
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
of what to do this may not be very
 
03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
helpful for me
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
so personally and if I may make that
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
very clear personally I'm fine with the
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
bill as is because I don't want to
 
03:54:56.349 --> 03:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
impose an unfunded mandate I think the
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
availability of the free programs is not
 
03:55:01.950 --> 03:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
at risk and frankly given that you know
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
this is life-saving care I don't see any
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
way to not ask the schools to have this
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
life saving thing there now we can talk
 
03:55:13.870 --> 03:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
about whether it should be funded
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
directly by the doe or we can put some
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
money somewhere in a school funding
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
thing right but I would say that given
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
that right now this does not seem to
 
03:55:24.750 --> 03:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
cost anything other than some admin time
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
to apply for a free thing I think I'm
 
03:55:30.910 --> 03:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable passing the bill as is
 
03:55:33.870 --> 03:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that in the future we may if
 
03:55:37.149 --> 03:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
somehow the landscape changes so much
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know start reimbursing and frankly I
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
think the department in the ru making
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
ability may have the ability to say you
 
03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:45.189 align:start position:0%
ability may have the ability to say you
know

03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
will uh if if the availability of the
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
free products is no longer there then
 
03:55:53.229 --> 03:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
we'll have to figure it out in 6 months
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
or one year or until the next budget
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
comes I don't know but I think there is
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
enough leeway for the Department to
 
03:56:00.149 --> 03:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
adopt rules that would protect us from
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
an unexpected need for lots of funds and
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
given the critical nature of you know
 
03:56:10.110 --> 03:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
the need to have this things in school
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable but again if the
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee would like
 
03:56:15.269 --> 03:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
more work please try to indicate to the
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
sponsors what you're looking for so they
 
03:56:18.990 --> 03:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
can do what they need to
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
do that's representa Kelly uh yes I
 
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
think that since the department has
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns that they should
 
03:56:30.790 --> 03:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
be consulted as to what the effects are
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
from leaving this language this way and
 
03:56:36.510 --> 03:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think jel car should be messing
 
03:56:38.910 --> 03:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
around with what the intent was when we
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
passed it I don't think that's under
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction to clarify policy
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's already been passed that would be
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you uh I think I am a
 
03:56:54.510 --> 03:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
member of Jael car I'm actually the vice
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
chair of Jael car and um the language
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
was written in this way in order to show
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
that the intention is first do the free
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
programs and say why you're rejected if
 
03:57:06.750 --> 03:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
not come come with a reason why not and
 
03:57:08.830 --> 03:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
then the language about adopting rules
 
03:57:11.469 --> 03:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
for the most fiscally um Mo I guess
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
Financial I don't have the specific
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
language but basically protect the State
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
while protecting kids I think is a far
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
more clear legislative intent than we
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
have in many many other bills and rules
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
that come in front of us I would note
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
that the amount of time that it'll take
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
to draft the language for this to pass
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
and then for them to draft the rules and
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
then get the point where we would be
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
adopting rules and there may even be a
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
chance for this reimbursement wouldn't
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
even happen during this upcoming budget
 
03:57:40.830 --> 03:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
inless um some sort of unless something
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
happened very very quickly um we're
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
going to have an opportunity for them to
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
work on these rules but there won't be a
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
chance to reimburse it until um probably
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
starting at least 2 years from now just
 
03:57:53.189 --> 03:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
when you look at the entire time frame
 
03:57:56.269 --> 03:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
and the normal process so the question I
 
03:57:58.349 --> 03:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
have is if this is if these things are
 
03:58:00.429 --> 03:58:00.439 align:start position:0%
all free to the
 
03:58:04.830 --> 03:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
all because as much as people ask for
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
local control they seem to ask for
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislature for what
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
they do I think it's it's a really
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunate disconnect um and I wish we
 
03:58:19.149 --> 03:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
could get past the idea of it's local
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
control but you must tell us what to do
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
but does the direction have to be
 
03:58:25.950 --> 03:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
related to money could it just be you
 
03:58:27.349 --> 03:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
talked about something with the
 
03:58:29.389 --> 03:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
prescriptions and St school and all that
 
03:58:31.229 --> 03:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
kind of thing what have we limited the
 
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill to that so they just basically says
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation if you
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
will um thank you enabling legislation
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
already passed uh already passed the
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
house so there's already enabling
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for the prescription we
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
already had enabling legislation for the
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
auto injectors but schools aren't
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
getting these and they're not applying
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
for them um the question is why maybe
 
03:58:53.950 --> 03:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's because it's so far down the totem
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
toll I can't imagine the idea that not
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
having a rescue medication that you can
 
03:59:01.630 --> 03:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
get for free isn't one of the highest
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
priorities of every single School
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
District but the fact that school
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
districts don't have them suggests that
 
03:59:10.590 --> 03:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
that suggest that um they haven't
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
listened to the gentle suggestions yet
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
so what if just mandated it left it a
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
that like other mandates we put out
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
there that they
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
ignore no no that's a serious question
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's a great question we
 
03:59:25.710 --> 03:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
have many policies in my school district
 
03:59:28.030 --> 03:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
that are not consistent with current law
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
um how do we deal with that well my
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
point is this if what you're saying is
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
that we need force them to do this and
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
it really is free and you want to give
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
them a push so it could mandate it I
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
schools that saw a mandate that wasn't
 
03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
costing them anything wouldn't be
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
inclined to go along I'll leave this to
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
you I I can't understand it either but I
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to step on the prime
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor's toes on this no no you're
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
doing a good job I
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand it either um one
 
04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's life- saving and two it's free why
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
schools aren't doing it already I have
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
but I also don't want to be sitting here
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
saying oh we should have done something
 
04:00:16.269 --> 04:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
if God forbid it child dies next year in
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
the school system because it wasn't done
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
so I it's a simple thing that doesn't
 
04:00:23.429 --> 04:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
really cost any money so maybe the
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee could give me you know their
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts what do you all think of
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
this I'm totally supportive of the
 
04:00:33.309 --> 04:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
policy um I mean as you said why
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you do this um and I guess I
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
would my brothers would be to have the
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
policy basically be bulletproof and my
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
concerns with the um talking about the
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and what you have to do
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
in order to get it or to have a line
 
04:00:50.479 --> 04:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
in order to get it or to have a line
item

04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
item
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation um makes me feel that this
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
is something that could sort of derail
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
this um again that might be a very
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
extreme reaction from but you who knows
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
what can happen here um and so I'd be
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable without any of the
 
04:01:08.189 --> 04:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation I would you know I totally
 
04:01:09.550 --> 04:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
support the policy and I'd like to make
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
sure the policy is basically bulletproof
 
04:01:16.349 --> 04:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
what anything else would go to it so but
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.990 --> 04:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
papovich so here's a thought I read the
 
04:01:29.550 --> 04:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
current language of 200 coln 44
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
DB and basically it says that the school
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
May authorize to use it and so on and so
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
forth right and it says that they are
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
free to go to ask for no charge fair
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
market prices so that's the existing
 
04:01:45.269 --> 04:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
thing so first I don't worry about the
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
Mandate because the DN thing is already
 
04:01:48.189 --> 04:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
in laow we wouldn't be mandating
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
anything that's not already there but if
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
we want to get rid of this whole
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation concern for the committee
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we can just get rid
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
of the whole part two of the bill don't
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
even edit
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
244b except to add the reference to the
 
04:02:06.560 --> 04:02:08.030 align:start position:0%
244b except to add the reference to the
nasal

04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
nasal
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
sprays which currently is not there
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
right now it just says
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
injectors and this way you know you have
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
it the free programs are available I
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody can complain about
 
04:02:27.670 --> 04:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate if the supplies are
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
free and if at some point in time this
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
is no longer free and easily available a
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
future you know budget will look into
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
how to reimburse the schools for it if
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
it becomes a problem but at this point
 
04:02:40.399 --> 04:02:42.590 align:start position:0%
it becomes a problem but at this point
in

04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:45.630 --> 04:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
time look look I hate spending money
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
especially other people's money okay but
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
I mean you're talking about at most 100
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
or 200 and the prices may drop over time
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
as this is more generic and whatnot and
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
patents expire and all that and you're
 
04:03:00.030 --> 04:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the potential death on the
 
04:03:01.229 --> 04:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
school grounds that could have been
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
easily prevented by a simple you know
 
04:03:05.830 --> 04:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
easily available
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
medication I think I would personally be
 
04:03:10.149 --> 04:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
fine passing the bill as is because I
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
don't think the appropriation is going
 
04:03:13.950 --> 04:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
to be any significant risk because if
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
the committee is really worried about it
 
04:03:19.229 --> 04:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
if we have an amendment that changes
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
section two to only add the references
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
to the nasal spray instead of saying the
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
involved I would be fine with that I'm
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
just brainstorming here to see if the
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
committee has an interest in any of this
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
and uh again I apologize to the sponsors
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm mangling the bill in ways they
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
didn't intend I I'm just trying to find
 
04:03:42.510 --> 04:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
a you know good
 
04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
outcome the only thing I would keep is
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the annual report going to the
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because right
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
now some states have it um we don't
 
04:03:56.429 --> 04:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
national average um on the low end six
 
04:03:58.349 --> 04:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
out of 100,000 students need an
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
epinephrine dose during the school year
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
on the high end it's 22 out of 100,000
 
04:04:05.790 --> 04:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
pupils so it is needed uh but we have no
 
04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
data in New Hampshire to say this is how
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
many times it happened so keep that but
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes if if it concerns everybody else
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the uh reimbursement portion then
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes we can remove that so so just to
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
clarify we're talking about specifically
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
removing section two part Roman numeral
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
six that whole paragraph on page one and
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
then on the back page we're talking
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
four are you working from the original
 
04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
bill or the Amendments I'm working from
 
04:04:39.550 --> 04:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
what you just hand just out so you're
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
removing which parts um section number
 
04:04:42.880 --> 04:04:44.269 align:start position:0%
removing which parts um section number
two

04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral
 
04:04:46.640 --> 04:04:49.309 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral
six

04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then section four and then
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
section four okay and then that adds the
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
assisted personnel with anaphylaxis
 
04:04:59.950 --> 04:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
training and the annual annual
 
04:05:04.670 --> 04:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
report okay Mr chair yes ma'am uh so I'm
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the RSA now and my
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
initial comment still stands because
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
there are additional sections in RSA 200
 
04:05:14.040 --> 04:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
there are additional sections in RSA 200
col

04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
col
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
44b that are not being changed that has
 
04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
permissive language but if we're only
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
changing section subsection five
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
according to this new Amendment um we're
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a disagreement in law
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
between Ma and shs
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
and no I'm talking about um so this is
 
04:05:38.110 --> 04:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
page one of the
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
amendment line 19 and
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
Below whatever we retain this this is
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
changing RSA 200
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
44b and the issue is that if you only
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
change subsection five the current law
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
sections 1 through four have permissive
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
language but now section five will have
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory language so again my initial
 
04:06:05.950 --> 04:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
comment about having the sponsors maybe
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
um spend a little more time with with
 
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
particularly the lawyers OS who can help
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
them with this Lang
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
redraft could you perhaps just read
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the one two three or fours
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
of of the real manal just so I
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
understand why you have a problem with
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
SH being in one of the subsections not
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
everyone so it says a school board
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
subsection one says a school board May
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
authorize a school nurse who is employed
 
04:06:29.469 --> 04:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
by the school district for whom the
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
board is responsible to maintain the
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
supply um so if you keep going down it
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's changing right
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
um the permissive language because now
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
our our the higher sections up the page
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
say say shall
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
right I thought you said they say may
 
04:06:53.710 --> 04:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
they do under current law okay so I'm
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
just I think that maybe more eyeballs
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
need to be put on this I I don't want to
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
rush us to a decision that might put
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
contradictions between Ma and shells and
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
existing line you are the attorney but I
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
can read English yeah I think if you
 
04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
come to a subsection that says sh You'
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
know that for the annual report part
 
04:07:14.910 --> 04:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's a sh
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the other pieces it sounds
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
like it's a May or am I misunderstanding
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about the other sub
 
04:07:19.640 --> 04:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about the other sub
pieces

04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm just afraid that the intent that
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsors may have is not what we'll
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
read on the paper if we were to move to
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.349 --> 04:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
that do this do the witnesses have any
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
concerns or comments Ian I mean I think
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward that the
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
report that you would do is say well we
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
chose not to do this we chose not to
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
apply essentially saying we chose not to
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
apply for this free program that would
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
give me f ANF and we chose not to so
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're not giving it to any of our
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
students they just have an opportuni to
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
submit that report that they shall
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
submit um I mean honestly maybe if you
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
have to put in a report that says yeah
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't bother to apply for the free
 
04:08:33.149 --> 04:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
Goods um maybe that'll end up being the
 
04:08:34.830 --> 04:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
the carrot that we need instead of the
 
04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
Stick of the overall shell um but I I
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
mean I I just I don't want to talk my
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
question is about talking for all the
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
other co-sponsors who who are really
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
pushing to make sure that this is as
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
strong and robust as possible because um
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
most of them have kids in their family
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
that have anaphylactic reactions and
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
they remember what it was like before
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
they had remember what life was like
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
before they had that diagnosis and they
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
know there's other kids sitting in our
 
04:09:05.070 --> 04:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
at school desks that don't know yet that
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
they have an anaphylactic reaction to
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
something so I don't want to say that I
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not going to say that
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
just saying the annual report is going
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
to make these school districts fall into
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
line my other question would be do we
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
just push through and put this into the
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
everybody representative Murray um just
 
04:09:27.389 --> 04:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
sort of as a touch Point
 
04:09:29.550 --> 04:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
um Health and Human Services has
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
approved the policy and we're con
 
04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to be concerned just with the
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
money part of it and so um being just my
 
04:09:40.030 --> 04:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
concern is sort of protecting Department
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
of Education from having a big a big you
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
know whatever even if it's a small
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
amount but um as far as you know there
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
may be issues with the policy but Health
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
and Human Services already passed the
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
policy so actually Health and Human
 
04:09:55.510 --> 04:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
Services passed a different policy that
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
allowed nasal sprays this bill went to
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
education policy which is why we had the
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
different languages coming out through
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
the first vote on the floor but
 
04:10:06.670 --> 04:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
education policy said end fully endorsed
 
04:10:09.910 --> 04:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
on consent the idea that while we're all
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
trying to save money um sometimes
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
backstopping a free program makes
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
sense so I guess I would ask if anybody
 
04:10:20.590 --> 04:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
would be willing to make a motion that
 
04:10:25.710 --> 04:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
we amend the bill with amendment number
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
0575 modified to delete section two
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.030 --> 04:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
four section two Roman numeral 6 not not
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
four represent papovich I will make a
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
motion as uh suggested by the chairman
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%

04:11:12.510 --> 04:11:12.520 align:start position:0%

04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
second before proceeding Mr
 
04:11:25.469 --> 04:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
weran oh sorry representative Hain
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
Phillips and representative papovich
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
made the motion um basically the two
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
hyphenated names are in Mr land again is
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
that too much to no you can handle that
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I didn't get a copy of the new
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I'm assuming is the only
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
change just that made a sh that's been
 
04:11:47.309 --> 04:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
it repres Leon do you have another copy
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the amendment I do you could give one
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education maybe yes
 
04:12:04.990 --> 04:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
I can give uh one of these copies to no
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
no no I want it for you you have from oh
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
I already gave them to the Department of
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
Education thank you that's all I wanted
 
04:12:11.149 --> 04:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
to do I I should have gone for the 20 I
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
said 12 with the number of people I
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
didn't realize how much markup we would
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
be doing I'm I
 
04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
apologize um that's a good question so
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we could have the department come
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:30.990 --> 04:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
say so maybe folks in the department of
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
of Education could come back
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
and tell me you still hate this bill no
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're a free range committee here I just
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
want to clarify I don't hate I don't
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
love we are remain completely neutral
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
and just want to make sure we're
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
pointing out if it were to pass we
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do anything and
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's the type of legislation I like to
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
point out because if there is a a price
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
tag associated with it but nothing
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
appropriated I can't do anything in that
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
puts this all in a bad I apologize for
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
being factious but do you how do you
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
feel about the amendment with those
 
04:13:15.239 --> 04:13:17.349 align:start position:0%
feel about the amendment with those
pieces

04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
removed do you want to speak to that
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
sure um I think um to to representative
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
hack's Point um what's in current I
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
think that the maybe the sponsors just
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
to clarify what's in current law um just
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that if they're looking to
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
either repeal it or um just make sure
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
that the amendment matches what's in
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
current law um because it it might be a
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
little bit contradict on the ma versus
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
the shells um depending on what so
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
because honestly I I I can speak English
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of curious as to what
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's separate independent sentences
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
four of them say May and the fifth one
 
04:13:59.109 --> 04:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
says shall doesn't there's no
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
there this is repealed and reenacted so
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
the current language will Disappear
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.469 --> 04:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
five or
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
four Roman numeral four so four in
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
current law the if the intent of the
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill is to mandate them could you read
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
four so we know it's it says a school
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
may enter into an agreement with a
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of epinephrine Auto
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
injectors their party suppliers of
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
epinephrine Auto injectors or healthc
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
care offices to obtain the epinephrine
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
Auto injectors at no charge or at Fair
 
04:14:46.349 --> 04:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
market prices or at reduced prices a
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
school district May accept gifts grants
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
or donations from foundations
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
organizations or private parties to
 
04:14:54.109 --> 04:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
purchase the epinephrine Auto
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
injectors we're requiring them to do
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
this no you we're requiring them to
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
provide an annual
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
report that's where the Sha is you just
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
read maze not
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
shells in current law so if the proposed
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation wants to require them to do
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
this in current them to do what to enter
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
into the agreement to get the free
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
epipens we're not trying to require them
 
04:15:20.600 --> 04:15:23.990 align:start position:0%
epipens we're not trying to require them
okay

04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
right lines
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.880 --> 04:15:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
of

04:15:39.070 --> 04:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
okay I me you get that we're only adding
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 5 to three
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
existing Roman four existing Roman
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.429 --> 04:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
Philips uh it's entirely up to the
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
sponsors how they want to move forward
 
04:16:06.030 --> 04:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
with this I would leave it to them if
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
they think they need more time if they
 
04:16:11.149 --> 04:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't that's also fine I just think you
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
know whatever the end result is it's
 
04:16:15.630 --> 04:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
going to be their bill so they should be
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
able to defend it I guess whatever way
 
04:16:19.950 --> 04:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
they want to go I thought they had but
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
we'll have them up here one more time to
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
confirm and you so you're okay with
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
where we are now as far as the concerns
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has as far
 
04:16:30.870 --> 04:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
as for the Department of Education our
 
04:16:33.109 --> 04:16:33.119 align:start position:0%
part is is clear okay thank you our
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
marching orders are clear okay thank you
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe the sponsors can come back up
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
and just confirm they want to go forward
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
with this and and I would just say that
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm being
 
04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
the question is do we push this forward
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
because right now we could put an outp
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
out get it through the house off to the
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
Senate and see what happens otherwise it
 
04:16:53.469 --> 04:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
hangs out and we retain it it hangs out
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
until we do the budget and
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
then I don't know what happens so I I
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
leave it in your hands in terms of which
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
route you'd rather us
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
take I think taking out what we talked
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
about and leaving the rest still leaves
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and just gets rid
 
04:17:10.990 --> 04:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
of some of the confusion so I'm okay
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
with doing that okay and representative
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%
I know it's not your bill but do you
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
feel the same way yes I'm definitely all
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
right with that okay and Mr land again
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with what we're
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
talking about here okay so we have a
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
motion on the table it's the
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
OTP uh amendment number 20250
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
055 excuse me
 
04:17:33.119 --> 04:17:34.870 align:start position:0%

04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%

04:17:45.790 --> 04:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
I got
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
it yeah you're right I'm sorry I was I'd
 
04:17:49.950 --> 04:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
given mine
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
away you can have mine you can keep mine
 
04:17:52.640 --> 04:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
away you can have mine you can keep mine
I'm

04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
good so I'll start
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
again a motion on the
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
table to amend HB
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
677 with Amendment 2025
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
d575 H modified to strike section two
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
6 and then also strike section four and
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
of course we number all the sections uh
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
accordingly so I guess my first question
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
is does that Amendment make
 
04:18:29.399 --> 04:18:31.950 align:start position:0%
is does that Amendment make
sense

04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%

and we'll do that but remember all we're
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.640 --> 04:21:11.550 align:start position:0%

04:21:11.560 --> 04:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.520 --> 04:22:11.510 align:start position:0%

04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay one is it does it do we need to
 
04:22:55.469 --> 04:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
have a separate motion to say we want to
 
04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.469 --> 04:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
enough I'd say you're far enough but if
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
you want to belt in suspenders I mean
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
typ typically you should have done a
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
vote to uh for an amendment and then
 
04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
well that's sort of how they took it so
 
04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
yeah um I would say that that's up to
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to decide how you want to
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
handle it I I really want to help my
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
poor Vice chair out he's very concerned
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%

sir one thing you may want to figure out
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
is um typically when you go to the full
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee usually whoever makes the
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
motion in the second will make the
 
04:24:49.229 --> 04:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
motion in the second across the way and
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
then speak to those bills I don't think
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
we've officially said okay represent
 
04:24:55.710 --> 04:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
whomever is going to speak to that bill
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the full committee I don't know if
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
you just want to make that clear moving
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
forward is is anybody willing
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
to make the motion and speak to the that
 
04:25:04.439 --> 04:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
