representative Marsh Marsh which is why
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
Senator gaida is not going to be able to
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
comment Senator gray is somewhere else
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
in the building and he's already come
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
downstairs thank you and said he'll be
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
here when he can be so I told him he
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
won't have any fun until he's here so
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
technically on Senator gaida it's my
 
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
understanding he's resigned from the
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
Senate and if he's resigned from the
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
Senate then he's really just not even
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
missing he's he's resigned I don't know
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
that I was here yesterday
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%

the last time we met in June I believe
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
the request was to give an update a
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
brief update on Hampstead Hospital my I
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
Hospital we've been about three months
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
operating now
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
um we actually are calling at Hampstead
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
Hospital and residential treatment
 
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 align:start position:0%
facility so you may see the acronym
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
hhrtf Hampstead Hospital and residential
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
treatment facility one of the things
 
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do with Hampstead
 
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of this year is to
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
create a prtf because we are acronym
 
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.249 align:start position:0%
create a prtf because we are acronym
happy

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
Facility so that hospital will provide
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
inpatient care as well as a prtf which
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
is a step down from a patient care
 
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 align:start position:0%
within inpatient care underway
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
the transition to the
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
new ownership has been smooth we have
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
well path as our vendor welcome Recovery
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions is our vendor I'm pleased to
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
tell you that all of the HHS management
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
positions there were six of them have
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
been filled and I think everyone is
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
aware of how hard it is to recruit
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
positions these days so that is quite an
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
accomplishment how many of these are
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
carried over from the previous team
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh only one okay
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
only one so one out of six uh the
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
accreditation and reimbursement
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
processes remain on track
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
um they are having Workforce issues as
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
I've just talked about as everybody else
 
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.330 align:start position:0%
I've just talked about as everybody else
is

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
um obviously that is a limiting factor
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of of a bed Supply because we
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
only have so many staff however they
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
have a recruitment plan that they've
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and that they're working diligently
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
on we also have a we made us the
 
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:42.500 align:start position:0%
department made a commitment to
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
to bid out after the first two years uh
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
for who would run the hospital with us
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
we are actually on track on time to
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
release that RFP probably this fall in
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
November part of the process prior to
 
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
that was to do a request for information
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
and working with our partners about what
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
would that look like what would make the
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
most sense for us for a model in running
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
the hospital pleased to tell you that we
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
had a robust response and that's going
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
to help us inform how we write that
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
request for proposals and structure the
 
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.769 align:start position:0%
request for proposals and structure the
hospital

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
what's your census presently
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
I believe I think the other day I think
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
we were at 37 but so you've moved from
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
some to quite a few we yes they it has
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
been increasing yes I can tell you that
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
and obviously we've had discharges and
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
Emissions happening on a regular basis
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the requests back in June was
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
to do a quarterly report for Hampstead
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital so it is Our intention
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
um to provide that to this committee
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
which would have detailed reports as we
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
do in some of our other updates and we
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
and give you your a robust uh review in
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
November at the November meeting I'm
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
assuming we have one in November
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
we just don't know when right there's a
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
couple of holidays in there yeah and an
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
election and an election yes a little
 
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.110 align:start position:0%
election and an election yes a little
busy

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
busy
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
so in terms of Hampstead that's that's
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
the the level of overview I have today
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
for the update unless there are any
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
any questions about Hampstead Hospital
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
for the record I live less than a mile
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
from Hampstead Hospital and Hampstead is
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
any thing else from the commissioner's
 
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.449 align:start position:0%
any thing else from the commissioner's
office

00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
yeah trigger question sure
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Ms Weaver
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
Center and um I I think as somebody who
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
interacted a great deal last legislative
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
session with others on the on the new
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
replacement I want to apologize to the
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
department because I think the
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
legislature has let you down
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
we were acting in good faith when we
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
said that we wanted to see it closed on
 
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
the 30th of March we had a parallel Bill
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
to describe the replacement and the key
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
aspect of that was the capacity of the
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
replacement and we just could not reach
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
agreement so we gave you nothing to go
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
on in terms of money to to plan and
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
design it and and so I I have a concern
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
about what one April looks like under
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
the current legislative environment
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
where you have to close it but we've
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
given you know where to replace the
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
facility so could could you could you
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
tell us about that
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure I I hope I don't see that day I
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
guess I would I would say that I think
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
it would be uh
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
a real problem come April 1st if we had
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
nowhere for the Youth that are there
 
00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:16.990 align:start position:0%
nowhere for the Youth that are there
currently

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
we can't just put the youth elsewhere as
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
many of you know those are some of our
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
most uh challenged youth in that
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
facility we can't just displace them to
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
a res provider if that was the case we
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
would have done that already we looking
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
at out-of-state placements other states
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
are just in the same predicament that
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're in so that potentially would mean
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
if depending on what the census was and
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
the profile of the population at that
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
time that those kids would be released
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
to situations that would probably not
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
benefit anyone
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
um and that would mean staff we you know
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
I I think it's really hard to keep
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing and keep morale and keep a
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
facility running with as it is now with
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
knowing that it may be closing
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so it would be a challenge all around
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think it would benefit
 
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.329 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think it would benefit
anyone

00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
so may I
 
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.750 align:start position:0%
so may I
uh

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
sorry the term maybe you're avoiding it
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
intentionally but uh could you could you
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
tell me what the impact might be on
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
Public Safety if um if the current lack
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
of plan goes through
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
I would say there would be a definite
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
impact on Public Safety it's hard for me
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
to predict knowing who particularly
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be there at that time in March but
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
if that were to happen today I could
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
tell you that there would be public risk
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
for some of these youth to be placed in
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
situations that would be not only unsafe
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
for them but potentially for the
 
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:48.740 align:start position:0%
community as well
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
sure okay just uh just so that you know
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
I've submitted two bills to OLS one is
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
to extend the date Beyond 30 March and
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
try to get that fast tracked it would be
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
great if the department could take a
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at it and consider being advocates
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
for an extension
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm only extending it for three
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
months which I believe will be
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
inadequate but but it should be enough
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
to have the department come and tell us
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
what it really ought to be so that we
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
can do do the right thing and then a
 
00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:29.899 align:start position:0%
parallel Bill uh I'm I'm reintroducing
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
the bill to Define what the sununu
 
00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:36.139 align:start position:0%
replacement Center ought to look like
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm putting in it since the
 
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.420 align:start position:0%
capacity issue was kind of the big deal
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm putting in the the draft up to
 
00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:47.410 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm putting in the the draft up to
18.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:47.420 align:start position:0%
18.
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
with operational planning for 12 to 14.
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
so so you'll have the physical capacity
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
to to breathe if you have to but that
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
the long-term operational costs should
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
be pegged a little lower at the 12 to 14
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
range so that's that's my intent there's
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
lots of time to talk about it I just
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
thinking that we're going to have a
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
public safety problem if we continue as
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
we are I want to get these two bills
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
fast tracked and I'd appreciate the
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
support of the department and getting it
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
passed thank you we are ready to have
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
that conversation and
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
anything further on this particular
 
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:31.069 align:start position:0%
anything further on this particular
topic

00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything further from the deputy yes
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
um given that we've been talking about
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
the new news center I wonder
 
00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:43.550 align:start position:0%
the new news center I wonder
um

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
what you can tell us about the two
 
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.889 align:start position:0%
what you can tell us about the two
recent

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:47.899 align:start position:0%
recent
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
incidents of
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
um the police having to come in and
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
quell some disturbances sure what I can
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
tell you is that
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have a combination of having a
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
Staffing crisis of not having the the
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
amount of staff that we really need to
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
be able to run the facility as well as
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
some of the toughest kids so it's almost
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
The Perfect Storm of uh happening here
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
where uh the need for staff is not is
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
not there so in times like that and this
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
is not unprecedented to the center we've
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
had to call in law enforcement in the
 
00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:28.019 align:start position:0%
past it's been a long time since we've
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
had to do that but for the safety of the
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
the youth and for the safety of our
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
staff we will rely on that Resource as
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
we need to so I will tell you that what
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
happened wasn't anything out of the
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
ordinary that wouldn't happen in a
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
facility like that it's our limiting
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
factor is that with the amount of staff
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we had and the Acuity of the need
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
of the of the youth it creates a
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
situation where we don't have enough
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
staff to do a two-on-one or a one-on-one
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
or what have you we're really stretched
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
really thin in those moments we need we
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
need that extra support and I I will
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
also say that it is hard for 4 we just
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
talked about closing the facility it is
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
very hard to recruit staff to a place
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
where they think that it's going to be
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
closing I think there's a lot of people
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
that want to come and help and work but
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
that is overshadowing the facility for
 
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.490 align:start position:0%
that is overshadowing the facility for
sure

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:18.500 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you I know that on the fiscal
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee we've recently approved some
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
funding to give you more staff have
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
those people not been hired or have
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
other people left we have the staff
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
isn't increased as you've requested yeah
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the staff has an increase
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's decreased we have had some
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
resignations uh just that took place a
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
little while ago we have more to come
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
those enhancements definitely help the
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
staff that are there recruiting staff I
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
just put out and I'll call to every
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
employee then the department yesterday
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
that has any experience in this field
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
would they be willing to come and work
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
some overtime when we have multiple
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
openings in any shift particularly on
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
the weekend we want to get all the help
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we can but even getting help
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
requires a training period that we've
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
tried to condense and be efficient but
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
people need to be trained I couldn't
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
just walk in there and say hey I'm going
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
to help you there needs to be some
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
training so we're looking under every
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
Rock asking every person that we can and
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
trying to recruit that way and we also
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
have a staffing agency that's helping us
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
as well but they're struggling with
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
recruitment as well
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%

will gather testimony from public and
 
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.690 align:start position:0%
will gather testimony from public and
officials

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:04.700 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
investigate the operations of the Board
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
in comparison to such boards
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
as they functioned in other states
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
and report to the oversight committee
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
their recommendations for legislation as
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
needed if that's the title of your bill
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
could you make that into an acronym
 
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
could you make that into an acronym
[Laughter]

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give the committee the and
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
will require a second on that motion if
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
it is to be approved but I'd like to
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
give the committee and the public some
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
of the background if they have not
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
already encountered it please um please
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
do so uh be aware I'm sure that the
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe which is I I think a
 
00:20:59.169 --> 00:20:59.179 align:start position:0%
paragon of virtue in the fourth estate
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
has a team called their Spotlight team
 
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:06.860 align:start position:0%
this Spotlight team has a long history
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
of deep investigation of issues of
 
00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:14.299 align:start position:0%
concern to the public generally
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
and that Spotlight team has won Pulitzer
 
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:21.500 align:start position:0%
prizes for the quality of their work
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
they are to be respected for the
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
journalism and dare I say appreciated
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
in the last few days
 
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:37.460 align:start position:0%
they have begun to feature a story on a
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
malpractice investigation at a major
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
hospital here in the state
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
which involves
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
um the question of whether the New
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
has been transparent in making available
 
00:21:59.649 --> 00:21:59.659 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
a list of malpractice claims lodged
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
against a single practitioner at that
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
major Hospital
 
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.669 align:start position:0%
major Hospital
the

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
allegation in Spotlight news reporting
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
and again I'm being very careful to
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
state that this is an allegation
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
and that it is the job of the journalist
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
to raise issues and to alert the public
 
00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:35.539 align:start position:0%
rather than to provide a testimony
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
that is perfectly documented we have
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
another obligation then the journalists
 
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.169 align:start position:0%
another obligation then the journalists
do

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:44.179 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
the spotlight team has alleged that our
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is 50th in the country
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
in transparency in reporting uh
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
malpractice claims and the resolution of
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
those claims
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
that news is going to be out among our
 
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.450 align:start position:0%
that news is going to be out among our
constituents

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
they are going to ask what our role as
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
legislators is in investigating the
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
place of the Board of Medicine in
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
regulating malpractice claims and making
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
them transparent
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and it is Our obligation as
 
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
um and it is Our obligation as
legislators

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
to do our own investigation of the Board
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
of Medicine to be very careful about the
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
testimony that we take from
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
professionals and from the public
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
and that we consider whether we wish to
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
make to this committee any
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation to deal
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
with the issues that arise
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
in order to do this we require a
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughly professional subcommittee
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is willing to sit through the
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
testimony of the public and the
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
testimony of the professionals and to
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
sort through uh whether there is a
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
legislative solution required so with
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we have the motion here it comes
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
again Mr Clerk and I thank you for your
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
patience uh can I read to you what I
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
think I have and then and then you can
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
tell me how to fix it uh I I think your
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
motion is that the chair shall establish
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee to investigate the
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
transparency and Reporting by the New
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine and that he
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
should appoint members to that
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that will take testimony as
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
needed and compare and contrast our
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
approaches to other state standards and
 
00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:58.460 align:start position:0%
develop a report
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
to uh from the committee with
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr clerk that was quite
 
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
excellent you'll take that absolutely
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
okay I I should have screwed it up
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
because I don't ever want to do this
 
00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
because I don't ever want to do this
again

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're all short-handed we all serve
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
where we must may I ask a question of
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
the of uh representative please
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
um okay so just just for Clarity on the
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
scope of of this committee uh I I think
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
your your intent is to trigger
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee specifically because we
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
have an instance that's being reported
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
by the Boston Globe but your intent is
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
not for us to look into that one
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
instance what you're looking for is the
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
systemic approaches around the Board of
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
Medicine and their transparency
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
reporting is that correct that is
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
exactly correct representative and given
 
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
your personal Cassidy may I respectfully
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
request that you work closely on this
 
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
request that you work closely on this
committee

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
that'll be the chair that's the chair's
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
choice of course representative soloway
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
I was Consulting with my colleague you
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
may have said but if not I'm going to
 
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
say there were no references on the New
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine to this
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
particular individual but there was
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
extensive reference on the Massachusetts
 
00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.289 align:start position:0%
extensive reference on the Massachusetts
board

00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
and yet we are talking about an events
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
that are allegedly taking place in New
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why would Massachusetts
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
have more information than our own state
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
is the trigger here uh Mr chairman if
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
you'll permit me I've carefully avoided
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
references to this particular case I've
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
been quite careful about that you have
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
and I wish to avoid that at all costs
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct as you typically are
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts did in fact report
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
all the instances that were relevant to
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
this particular case but I wish to avoid
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
any comment on the case whatsoever I
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
agree with that but my bringing it up is
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
raises the question of why was this not
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
reported here and it could have been
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
about any number of people on any number
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
of occasions on any number of issues
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is incidental
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's just compare contrast and it could
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
well be that there are statutes or laws
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are preventing
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
them from doing this this could be an
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
overreaction to the days when too much
 
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100 align:start position:0%
was disclosed so we're not prejudicing
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
the board of medicines guilt or laziness
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
or anything we're just asking these
 
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
questions in general
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are asking questions about the
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
function of the board in general
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation earlier this week
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
with Lindsay Courtney JD executive
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
director of The Office of professional
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
afterwards known as oplc and they
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
provide administrative support to over
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
40 Professional Licensing Boards of
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
which the Board of Medicine is one
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
and there is signed into law what was
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 which establishes a
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee it's functioning presently I
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
believe under Senator Carson in the
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
chair it was formed it is meeting to
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
review the structure of Licensing and
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
the relationship with the office and the
 
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.510 align:start position:0%
the relationship with the office and the
boards

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
to make recommendations with a final
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
report due November 1st I asked
 
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.850 align:start position:0%
report due November 1st I asked
um

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
the director if that might make what
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're muting uh unnecessary and she
 
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:27.860 align:start position:0%
said absolutely not that we are doing a
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
microcosmic thing she is doing a macro
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
Cosmic thing and she would welcome and
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
she hopes the SB 330 committee would
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
welcome anything that we generate early
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
on particularly
 
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.169 align:start position:0%
on particularly
um

00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
so she says very much this would be a
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
good idea that we go forward with this
 
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
it would not over it would overlap but
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
it would not um be inappropriate given
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
the SB 330
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
the group Mr chairman to move forward we
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
will need a second I know that and then
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
of course it will be your prerogative to
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
recruit uh committee should the motion
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
pass before we vote on it uh Mr Ester
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
house uh from oplc is here and if you
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
want to come up to the chair and make
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
the microphone red
 
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.789 align:start position:0%
the microphone red
yeah

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
in case there's any input you'd like to
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
give us and answer any questions we
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
might have for clarity or is this being
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
recorded is this a is a video going to
 
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:33.860 align:start position:0%
be available later
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
do you know usually do we know it's
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
recorded I don't believe the fourth
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
floor gal is here and I don't see a
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
substitute all right so I'm sorry for
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
the interrupted I'm just sure that's
 
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.850 align:start position:0%
the interrupted I'm just sure that's
fine

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is douglasoster I
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
am general counsel for oplc and I
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
believe what you said is correct we had
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
a conversation earlier about that the
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee 330 has been meeting
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're having their third meeting next
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and we are going over a number
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
of things fee structures
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities between the boards
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
between oplc and one of the things we
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
are taking a look at is uh is the
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
hearing processed adjudication those
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of things in the state and
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out what we're looking at
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
is I believe the number is 54 boards
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
that may change by the time I get back
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
to the office
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
um sort of the structure of of
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
everything on the whole we aren't
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily taking a look or doing a
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
deep dive on any particular board but it
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
does mean we are looking at every board
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
which lines up with what you said I
 
00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
believe Mr chair I I didn't get the name
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
and do you have a do you have a business
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
card do you have a business card if you
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
just gave me the business card that
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
would be better I get dyslexic when I
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
listen I'll take one too while you're up
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'll take a business card too
 
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just had a
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
question and I'm just trying to clarify
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
in my mind is this a creation of a
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of this committee to work
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the committee
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
established by SB 330. this will be a
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of this oversight board to
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
work on its own but be
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
in contact with SB 330. sharing work
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
product at least from us to them and
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully them to us and
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
but that's not an official appointment
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
that is what I expect this group to do
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason to do that I'm just
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
thinking about redundancy of efforts you
 
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
know is in the rationale to do that is
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
my question I guess
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
the conversation I had with director
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
Courtney indicates what we're trying to
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
do is microcosmic they're trying to do

but it will not be
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%

could I ask her back I have a couple of
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
questions I would ask if I were normally
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
just sitting here but the notes threw me
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
off I I have two uh spontaneous surprise
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions with the chairs leave you may
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh one for the chair please oh maybe I
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
should have left yeah yeah so but so so
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
I realize these are surprise questions
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I I'll I'll take with a grain of
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
salt anything you have to share with us
 
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.790 align:start position:0%
salt anything you have to share with us
but

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.810 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're you're aware of the
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral system and the
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
legislature's concern about the closed
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
loop referral system over the last I
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't know a year or whatever and so
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
could you do you know
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
um what the status of the closed loop
 
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:44.780 align:start position:0%
referral system
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting process is and what sort of
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
timeline you might be on uh reviewing
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
and accepting bids
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
I can find that out for you I don't have
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
that with me at my fingertips right now
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm not surprised but it would be
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
great to just get um some insight to
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
where we are with the closed loop
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
referral system
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then I have a second question and
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the clerk please jot down anytime
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
any of us ask of anyone for further
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
information and who that person is
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
promising to get it back to us at some
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
point put that on your minutes please
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
all right and since I'm the acting clerk
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
you'd get it to me and I'll distribute
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the committee
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um second question
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead okay uh last week uh
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
during the fiscal committee uh there was
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
a little over I'm sorry there was a
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
little over six million dollars that was
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
accepted in federal funds to fund
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
um mobile Vans to go throughout the
 
00:37:54.849 --> 00:37:54.859 align:start position:0%
state and provide vaccines and um
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccines and the the demographic
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
that was called out specifically there
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
were probably others that would also
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
receive it but the ones that were called
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
out specifically were children under the
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
age of five to receive their first shot
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
and kids over the age of five for for
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
boosters and that and the fiscal
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee approved at eight to nothing
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
the executive committee approved it and
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
so the monies come and the program's
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
going but what we asked the director of
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
was to have and I I don't know his title
 
00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:37.339 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan to have Dr Chan uh
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
provide a public-facing document
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
that states his assessment of the
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
quality of the research and the science
 
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:54.140 align:start position:0%
that would deal with
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
providing injections like vaccines to
 
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:02.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise healthy kids and to paraphrase
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
the director of Public Health she said
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that she was unsure what that would look
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
like and that she would think about it
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's been a week and so I
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
would just I'm just curious on a
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up what is Dr Chan's
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
public-facing statement going to look
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
like how will it be made available to
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question this is
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
Anne Landry associate commissioner that
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
oversees Public Health
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
good morning state your name again
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
please sure good morning Ann Landry
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner for Department of
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for your question
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and I may not be
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
answering it in the way that you want
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
but a director Tilly has been out on a
 
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:47.540 align:start position:0%
family matter since last since Saturday
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so while she's working as much as
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
she can that hasn't been the focus of
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
this week's work just given everything
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
else as you know that's going on in in
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
however I can commit to you that this is
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
on our radar we've engaged with Dr
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
Ballard and with Dr Chan and we will
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
think about as director Tilly see did
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
the best format for how we may do that
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
and work with our Communications
 
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.530 align:start position:0%
and work with our Communications
Department

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
um on how we'll present that so it
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
hasn't fallen off our radar but I
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
apologize it just hasn't been able to be
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
a priority with her out on a family
 
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
a priority with her out on a family
matter

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
so as as I I professionally I can accept
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
that answer I think that makes sense I I
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
hope in this Tilly's situation resolves
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
rapidly and positively I I I just think
 
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:35.660 align:start position:0%
that there's a group of our public
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
who has heard the phrase follow the
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
science for a very long time and would
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
like to be informed what the scientific
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
assessment is that's driving our policy
 
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:53.420 align:start position:0%
and particularly with with people being
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
particularly defensive about their
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
children I think this is an opportunity
 
00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:01.579 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
communicate that New Hampshire has
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
investigated the science and that making
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
these vaccines available to the this age
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
group is medically appropriate we're not
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
I don't I I don't want to prejudge Dr
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
Ballard and Dr chance assessment of the
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
research but I I think we owe it to the
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
public to to communicate otherwise it's
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
the state is essentially uh warranting
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
to the parents that we've done our
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
homework it's all good and and frankly I
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
I've not done my homework on this and so
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
I need the smart guys to smart people to
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
figure it out so I'm understood and
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
while I I don't want to speak for Dr
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
Chan or Dr Ballard who's more than
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to speak I I will promise you
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
that we heard the request and I and
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
agree that it will be a great
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share with the public the
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
science and the scientific articles for
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
which Ben or excuse me Dr Chan has
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
reviewed but we really want to make sure
 
00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:04.700 align:start position:0%
that it's presented in a digestible
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
method given I mean some of these
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
articles are very complicated I think
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas was to present a
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
summary on this Cliff Notes if you will
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the different articles so we're just
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
looking at the best best format so I
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and that's that's why
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the smart people to do that
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I think the opportunity to enhance
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
the high level of credibility the
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
department already enjoys is is there if
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
we can begin to have those conversations
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
about here's the science therefore that
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
this policy makes sense absolutely all
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you very much the
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
chair will add the fact that in my four
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
days at the CDC in June with 39 other
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
legislators from around the country when
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
they asked us for feedback and input
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
that was something we said and they
 
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
that was something we said and they
acknowledged

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledged
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
they hadn't done that to the degree that
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful now I think a
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
lot of what they did was incredible but
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
we can always make it better and in the
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
recent statement from their director
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
saying there will be some changes at the
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
CDC they took that and a number of the
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
suggestions we inputted to them in June
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
so this is just making it home here and
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
I know that'll come when you will be
 
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:23.780 align:start position:0%
ready with a report that will really
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
give the information people want so
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Dr Ballard you want to
 
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.970 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Dr Ballard you want to
add

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.809 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:37.809 --> 00:43:37.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
Dr Jonathan Ballard I work as the chief
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
medical officer of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:44.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
I just want to express our gratitude for
 
00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:50.420 align:start position:0%
putting forth this question
 
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.020 align:start position:0%
taking a step back each time information
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
recommendations come up from the CDC or
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
other federal health agencies we always
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
take a in-depth look at it we look at
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
the science behind the recommendations
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
not only the recommendation before we
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
you know agree to it ourselves there's a
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
number of professionals Dr Chan being
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
one of them that that often looks at the
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
met at the recommendations the science
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
behind each step we've done this that in
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
this case we do have
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
a great deal of of information that we
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
can put forth and plan to share publicly
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
um that would support that
 
00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.109 align:start position:0%
um that would support that
recommendation

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
for this particular uh initiative to do
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination however
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
what we're recognizing is that there
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
will be considerable constraints upon
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time where there will be
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
cases of Cobia 19 but also the workforce
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
shortage and then the need for increased
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
workers to do vaccine Administration
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the pharmacy setting the
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
primary care setting or elsewhere so
 
00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.270 align:start position:0%
primary care setting or elsewhere so
there

00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
but what that initiative will do is
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
essentially add some capacity some
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
breathing room for our health care
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to do all of this work
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
this fall at the same time including
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for flu which we encourage
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
individuals to get we note that there
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
was an increase in flu activity this
 
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.710 align:start position:0%
was an increase in flu activity this
past

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
winter in Australia summer here which
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
has been a good indicator in past years
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
of whether or not we'll have increased
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
flu season here so taking all that into
 
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:32.540 align:start position:0%
account with that Initiative for vaccine
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
accessed as its increased capacity for
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
those the persons particularly parents
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
who have any questions about their
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
childhood their children's vaccination
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
or health in general you know these
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
sites public sites probably would not be
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
the location for them it would be their
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
trusted Healthcare professional in the
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the office and that's what we want to
 
00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:57.500 align:start position:0%
emphasize is what we're not sending
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
parents and children to get information
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
from and and vaccination necessarily
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
from a public site if they have any
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
questions like that there are questions
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
about the science what's right for my
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
individual child is between you your
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
child and your health care provider and
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
we want to keep that being the um the
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
situation being married to a trusted
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
health care provider I would agree
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's how it works yes
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
so I absolutely agree patients provide a
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
relationship is the dominant one the the
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
reason I'm distinguishing this
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
initiative is because it's Federal money
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
that the state approved and so a bunch
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Finance Geeks said that you could go
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
ahead and spend your money on this and
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
so because we're putting our thumbprint
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
on on and effectively approving it it
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
would just be great if the state had a
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
position and if the primary channel of
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
communications was to the providers that
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
would be fine I'm not I wouldn't
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
prejudge how the information gets
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
distributed I just recognize I think we
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
have an obligation
 
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.849 align:start position:0%
have an obligation
um

00:47:03.849 --> 00:47:03.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
follow up okay and you probably heard
 
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:12.380 align:start position:0%
that Denmark is uh just very recently
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
suspended all requirements for vaccines
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
for all of the population 50 and younger
 
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.770 align:start position:0%
for all of the population 50 and younger
so

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't want to expand the scope
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
of what you're looking at but it's those
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that are out in the
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
public that triggers more fear
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and doubt about what our

Denmark can say no no more for anyone
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
under 50. so
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%

subcommittee was not voted into
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
the bill that was being heard during a
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
very challenging time
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
um during the Omicron surge earlier this
 
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
um during the Omicron surge earlier this
year

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I would say hospitals
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
never want to restrict visitation for
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
their patients they
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
did early on in the pandemic frankly at
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
the urging and request of federal and
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
and and local Health officials because
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the virus and really
 
00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
the unknown uh factors that we had
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
um the lack of PPE the lack of
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination and all and all of that
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.069 align:start position:0%
vaccination and all and all of that
um

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
over the summer of 2020 those began to
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
we worked with the commissioner and the
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
department to really open up um
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
Healthcare to open up uh visitation
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately we saw yet again
 
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
another surge
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
um but let's be clear hospitals do not
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
want to restrict visitation it's an
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
important part of the the healing
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
process but they have to do sometimes
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
they have to to protect the the health
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
of the patients uh the staff and and
 
00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:34.250 align:start position:0%
of the patients uh the staff and and
visitors

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
um as as you know this provision was
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
moved into the patient's Bill of Rights
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
which is a place where we thought that
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
it really belonged and we've been
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
working with our hospitals over the
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
summer to understand how they're making
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the their visitation policies known
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
to to patients and to families and
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
following through on working to ensure
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
that patients are able to have visitors
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
when they they come to the hospital
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
um whether that's in the emergency room
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
whether that's in the patient units or
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
whether that's frankly in the practices
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
that they that they run and we're very
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that you know hospitals
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
continue to work very hard to open up
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
those facilities to make certain that
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
patients can have
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
um visitors um while they are in their
 
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.650 align:start position:0%
um visitors um while they are in their
care

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
um Paula I'll turn it over to Paul and
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
ask her to summarize a few key points um
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of the work that we've been
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
doing over the summer with our members
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Steve so thank you chairman
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
Pearson and others for your support on
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and your continued involvement
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
during the committee of conference and
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
when this bill was finalized in the
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
committee of conference there was
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
discussion and requests that we come
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
back to this Committee in September to
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
update you on a couple things one was
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
discuss relative to how the hospitals
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
are making patients aware of their
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
visitation policies in addition to
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
posting on their website which they all
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
do have always have done for a long time
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that what are they
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
doing so I've been working with the
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they are well aware of the
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
law reviewing their policies as we speak
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
to ensure that patients and visitors are
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
aware of Hospital visitation policies
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
and the procedures in in a variety of
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
ways I think this points to the fact
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
that and what we testified on through
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
last session was that hospitals need and
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
require flexibility to ensure that the
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
guides written materials are not
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
outdated and that they are um they have
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
variations on how they are communicating
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
with their patients so on this request
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
um there was a variety of responses some
 
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
do include the Hospital visitation
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
policies in their admission packets some
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
post it all in patient and visitor
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
entrances some and provide them in the
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
inpatient and emergency room materials
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
and some have a general patient resource
 
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
and some have a general patient resource
guide

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
guide
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
and some post them throughout the
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
hospital so my point is just that it
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
there is a variety of ways that they are
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
communicating a lot of them are looking
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
at their current processes and updating
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
them but I am reminded by a number of
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
folks that have worked in hospitals that
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
now work here with us at the association
 
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:26.900 align:start position:0%
and Foundation that by by
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
these policies change so much those pack
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
packets are when they update them they
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
to change that up the chances of having
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
errors and having Incorrect and outdated
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
materials is really a problem that they
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid because they want to
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
communicate as best they can with their
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
patients so that one that it is it
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of them but uh as far
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
as how they communicate so I just that's
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
showing that they need flexibility the
 
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
other request was how are hospitals
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
informing patients or their
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
representatives in the case of a denial
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
or revocation of visitation rights
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
so um that is again a variety of ways
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
but it is either by the nurse manager or
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
the unit manager supervisor on the floor
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
um and that would be probably to the
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
patient and then the or or the
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative and or it sometimes
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
happens through security staff again it
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
they do it it just it there's a variety
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
of ways in which they communicate
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
the revocation it does not happen often
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
as um as you would as you would think so
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
it it that is but that is the variety of
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
ways that the hospitals deal with that
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
the other question had to do with how is
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
this documented because again this was
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
all debated during the course of of
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1439. how is this documented
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
um some documented in the EMR if it's a
 
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.730 align:start position:0%
um some documented in the EMR if it's a
patient

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
um issue and some documented in what is
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
they consider a security log and that
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be for a non-non-patient or
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
visitor because there's no EMR when it
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
comes to a non-patient um or yeah
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
visitor sometimes there's a letter that
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
ends up being scanned in the in the EMR
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's in the nurse's notes
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
again a variety of ways that they are
 
00:59:19.799 --> 00:59:21.349 align:start position:0%
again a variety of ways that they are
documenting

00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
documenting
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
the fourth question was how do hospitals
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
make patients aware of the patient Bill
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
of Rights this was pretty uniform
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
because they have been communicating
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
Patient Bill of Rights for a very long
 
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
time in addition to being on their
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
website they do have those in the in the
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
admissions packet so that was a
 
00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:40.789 align:start position:0%
admissions packet so that was a
consistent

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
um Universal response some have what
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
they call brochures as well as admission
 
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:49.460 align:start position:0%
packets but others say they have packets
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
handouts signage internet
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
um all of the above so um what I do want
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
to point out though is the the patient
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights has not actually been
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
updated by legislative Services yet and
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it could be even
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
though the the law is in effect the bill
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
the patient Bill of Rights has not been
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
updated there actually was another bill
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
that actually changed the patient bill
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
right so they're they legislative
 
01:00:14.099 --> 01:00:15.049 align:start position:0%
right so they're they legislative
Services

01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
um I think it takes up to possibly six
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
months I'm not sure
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
um before they update it and then once
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
they do that then and the hospitals will
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
update their their documentation but
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
they are waiting for the state to
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
actually update the patient Bill of
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
Rights right now which there actually is
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
a provision that allows the hospitals to
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
have that flexibility waiting for the
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
laws actually to be updated so I just
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out because they're
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
not if you look at the RSA there it is
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
not updated yet it's the last update was
 
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.730 align:start position:0%
not updated yet it's the last update was
2021.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
I have an unrelated question when you're
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
ready let's have related questions first
 
01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:56.030 align:start position:0%
ready let's have related questions first
yeah

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
oh there it is
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
hello Madam minahan hello representative
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
and Mr President of course uh to clarify
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
a continuity and just suggest on my bias
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
on all the work you've done on that you
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
all are doing is yet to be a Common
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
Language and the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
that would be then adhered to by all our
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
Medical Services uh hospitals in the
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1439 does not dictate what
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
the language is it just um requires them
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
to have their policies
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
um updated policies on their website
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
um that's what the the law says so to
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
ensure and to ensure that also um that
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
they always have a caregiver allowed
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
into the facility when appropriate if
 
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate then they have to
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
document why it would not be allowed so
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it's not prescriptive as far
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
as what is included in the policies is
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
that am I answering your question okay
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
that's the yes I mean that's the half of
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
it just the class I know in the on my
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
first happened in my mind here was then
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
the Common Ground would be the patient
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights would be in all of our
 
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.789 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights would be in all of our
hospitals

01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
modality of operation but in terms of
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
specific application for The Unique um
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
facilities and how they do things that's
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
where these other other criteria would
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
play a role that still needs to be
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
clarif clarified and confirmed
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
so you're right the patient Bill of
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
Rights as the original Bill did not have
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
um this this language of the law in the
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights we believed
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
because this really is a patient issue
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted we thought it made more sense
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
to be in the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
because the hospitals currently and
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
continue to post on their website and
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
make the patient Bill of Rights that is
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire in the admission
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
package so it's much more widely
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
distributed so the new language that
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
comes out of the law will be in the
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights so then that is
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
to get into the the interpretive legal
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
appeal to come once maybe on some of
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
these issues is uh relative to 1439 I
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me at the
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
moment but it would meet the the intent
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
of 1439 and what you just said is
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
happening outside of making the specific
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
facility might have just have maybe
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
different access rules just on the type
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
of services being provided
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
I I think yes I agree with that
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
statement yeah okay I want to make sure
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know I read what you write so okay
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
This Is Us liberal arts somewhat
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
ill-defined thought and I'm good at that
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
you as you know
 
01:04:03.059 --> 01:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
you as you know
um

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
with different hospitals
 
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.089 align:start position:0%
with different hospitals
doing

01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
is I I can see where that would be an
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
advantage you tailor it made to who you
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
are your community and all of that
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
I can also see there's many
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
disadvantages in that well my cousin who
 
01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
went to the hospital over there this is
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
what they did on that and I don't see
 
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
that around here yeah
 
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.789 align:start position:0%
that around here yeah
[Music]

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
discuss

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
I think what we what we've always said
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
is you know each individual Hospital
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
um follow the patient's Bill of Rights
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and to do what is in the best interest
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
of their patients um and to do so in in
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
ways that meet the the letter and the
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the intent of of what we're trying
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
um so giving them that flexibility we
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
believe is is is appropriate and
 
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
believe is is is appropriate and
important

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
um at the we also again as Paula noted
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know continue to work with our
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals share policies of what others
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
are doing so that you know we can try
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
and help others understand what their
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues are doing and and over time
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll likely create a little
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
bit more consistency but again at the
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
end of the day you know each individual
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
institution needs to fulfill its mission
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
to its patients and its community and
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
giving them that flexibility to do so
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
within the the spirit of the patient's
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights we believe is is entirely
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
appropriate the small family practice
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
facility I'm part-time CEO of does it
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
about that way too we want to see what's
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
best for us but I do talk to my
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
counterparts at other places and we swap
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
information and sometimes we wind up
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
learning from each other and that sounds
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
like what you're doing it's exactly what
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing yes and thank you um but yes
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
I should have mentioned that that they
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
do share where they're what their
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
current policies are and as Steve said
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
last year their policies change I know
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
one hospital had policies changing every
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
week for a while because during The
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Surge which makes it really really
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
challenging for all including obviously
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
folks coming into the facility so but
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
yes they do share along
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
um amongst each other all sorts of
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
different um what policies that they
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
have and then they bring them back to
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
their committees that they have
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
internally which I'm sure you're
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
familiar with that that structure and
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
then they do debate and discuss and
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
again based on the number of individuals
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
maybe at the time that have covid that
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
are in their facilities
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
and then what the burden is relative to
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that as well as the Staffing challenges
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
that they have they may have a more
 
01:06:46.849 --> 01:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
restrictive policy at one facility
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
versus one that's across the way
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
um or across across town
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so but that is kind of the these
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that they're facing right now
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your comment and I will
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
take that back to our hospitals to again
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
to continue having these discussions and
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
to appreciate exactly what you just said
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
that folks
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
visit a number of facilities throughout
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
the throughout the state and they're
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
going to see different potentially
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
different policies and to understand why
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
when we first
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
when it first hit us
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
when my staff thought that they had
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
adequately communicated through the
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
various ways we communicate with our
 
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.549 align:start position:0%
various ways we communicate with our
patients

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
adequately communicated what we were
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
doing and why
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
I said I think this needs to be doubled
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
if not tripled we need to say it again
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
and again and again we need to
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's written at the
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
non-technical level I mean I looked at a
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
document that was brilliant and if you
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
were teaching nursing it would have been
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
fantastic but this is going to our
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
patients who are not bad people and
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
they're not stupid people but they're
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
not technically medical people so we
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
made sure that when we thought they knew
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
it we told them again and when it was
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
changing we told them that and in our
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
opinion why
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think one of the strengths
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the hospital system here in New
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the work that we do through
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association through our
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
foundation for all the communities you
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
know we bring together
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
um you know the professionals um whether
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
it's the HR whether it's the nurses the
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
doctors the others and and and we do we
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
share best practices and we learn from
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
one another and I I would say you know
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
one of the Hallmarks of uh my time here
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I came from the American Hospital
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
Association where I saw hospitals and
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
associations across the country and I
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
would say one of the things that that I
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
believe truly is a Hallmark of what we
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
do here in New Hampshire is that we work
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
together and we there's an expectation
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
that we're going to work together and
 
01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:58.910 align:start position:0%
that we're going to work together and
collaborate

01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
collaborate
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
um certainly something we saw uh on full
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
display during the pandemic
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's it's truly what
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
defines how we how we do our work
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
together and so we'll continue to share
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to learn from one another
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll use these opportunities to
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
make to make that uh make that happen
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
and with the Miss minahan regular ready
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
to wipe down the microphone thank you so
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
much for coming unless you have another
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
one okay I'll hold hold that um all
 
01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:24.349 align:start position:0%
one okay I'll hold hold that um all
right

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
um hold your moist Tower left please
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards well I think uh
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's being discreet
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
with his finger over here you may have a
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
question not a question but maybe a
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
clarification and I was trying to think
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
of a rationale why different hospitals
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
do things differently
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
the patient Bill of Right is a uniform
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
Testament that all hospitals have but if
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
you I was trying to think of an example
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful to understand why
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
they could be different in different
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals you could have the same
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
diagnosis you know specific say cancer
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and in one hospital it may be
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
an infusion Suite that has a certain
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
amount of accessibility by the public in
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
by Family whereas you may be with the
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
same diagnosis in a more acute setting
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
like a tertiary care hospital that needs
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know PPE and gowns and no visitation
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
at all so you could carry the same
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
diagnosis but you do need to have
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
variations in the way you treat
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
visitation in other opportunities for
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
family and others to visit with patients
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Murphy any response to that
 
01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:31.100 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah amen sounds good
 
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's a statement to start I am not
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
running for re-election so this is not
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
an election question at all but a
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
statement that somewhat follows what
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
I live near frisbee Hospital
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
frisbee Hospital in my opinion
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
is a disaster at the moment that is my
 
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.630 align:start position:0%
is a disaster at the moment that is my
opinion

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
I have mentioned before it it's public
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
note on knowledge in all the newspapers
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
that it's really going downhill
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
they have lost approximately 20 doctors
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
several fired the rest have decided to
 
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.470 align:start position:0%
several fired the rest have decided to
quit

01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
quit
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
or retire
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hospital services are declining I know
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
that personally from the the latest
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
being the maternity services
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
a delay in getting images
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
test results and appears to be related
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
to staffing issues
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
ER patients are often not seen because
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
they do not have somebody to read an
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
x-ray or a test
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
I have recently been there for a test
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
this sounds silly and see a full parking
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
lot go in the hospital there's nobody
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
there so I'm sort of suspicious how the
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
cars appear but it's only an observation
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of this patients need to
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
seek Services elsewhere that messes it
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
up down the line because everybody like
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
myself or moving the other two get
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
doctors at other places and that delays
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
the receiving of doctors are overwhelmed
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
and more than not are not taking on new
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
patients or extremely long wait this is
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
not being done In fairness to the
 
01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
current patients if you are lucky to
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
find someone you are appointed to
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
typically your appointments typically
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
months away I'm very concerned about
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
this it affects the elderly affects the
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
people I would guess if we had a hearing
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
on this issue when we held it over in
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
Rochester area you'd have a room full of
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
people I would guess that 75 percent of
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
the people that use those services are
 
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.950 align:start position:0%
the people that use those services are
Furious

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
Furious
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
nothing against private ownership the
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
way it is going I personally asked I was
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
down there for a test a week and a half
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
ago for to talk to an administrator
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
someone came out and said they'll give
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
you a call while I'm still waiting no
 
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:08.780 align:start position:0%
response I'm really beginning to concern
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
the quality that some places
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
provide I've talked to doctors off the
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
Record I've talked to people who work
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
um in other ways with a hospital I've
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
talked off the record with employees
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
100 everybody says they've got a big
 
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.610 align:start position:0%
100 everybody says they've got a big
problem

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:27.620 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
employees are overworked especially
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
those who are just taking telephone
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
calls simple things and they're being
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
they'll use with work
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm just really concerned and I need
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
to I'm sorry I brought this up here but
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
it is something that the people in that
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
area need to find out what's happening I
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
totally know Mr chairman that there's a
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
shortage Statewide I do not deny that
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
but it's a tsunami effect at frisbee
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
hospital and I think it affects all the
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
area hospitals that everybody now
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
including myself have to move to doctors
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
because my primary doctor just I just
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
received a note that he's no longer
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to be there at the end of
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
September and there's one more to add to
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
the list I'm sorry to sound off but it
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
just affects me and thank you I'm a
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
small morning hand for helping me on
 
01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:16.219 align:start position:0%
another issue thank you
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
first appreciate the comments um
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
obviously I can't speak to your
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
individual situation
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I do know that um you know they
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
continue to to look to bring in
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
additional clinicians that's something
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing that that work
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
um you know the the workforce shortage
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
is absolutely very very real
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh something we've been you know
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
chronicling over the last uh several
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
months we actually just released a
 
01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:41.570 align:start position:0%
months we actually just released a
report

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
um last week
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
um hospitals in New Hampshire saw
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
133 percent increase in the cost of
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
outside labor contract labor so the need
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
to bring in Travelers nurses other
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
therapists uh other uh locums uh you
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
know providers to provide care to make
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
certain that there are doctors in the
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
emergency room that there are doctors
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
and nurses to care for patients um in
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
the hospital that is simply not a
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
sustainable Trend and it's something
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we certainly are going to be
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
working very very hard and through to
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
try and make certain that we can make
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
some progress but you know as I've been
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
saying since the beginning of the
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic we're going to need help to to
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
get through this um and you know we're
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
not through yet to the other side
 
01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.970 align:start position:0%
not through yet to the other side
completely

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and um the next you know 12 to 24
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
months I think are going to be some of
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
them more challenging
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
um yet
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's really around you know
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce and then you know Financial
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
sustainability which is really uh the
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
other side of the same coin Mr Annan
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
have you found that since the costs of
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
bringing in Travelers really is
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
increasing your budget the insurance
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
companies are rushing to up their
 
01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to the hospitals
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
I have not heard that Mr chairman
 
01:15:59.530 --> 01:15:59.540 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to us either
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards this for
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson it looked to me
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
like you were maybe reading off of some
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
notes do you want me to include those
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
notes in the minutes so that we uh
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
because I didn't do a very good job of
 
01:16:14.689 --> 01:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
recording all your concerns
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
clean up what I wrote on here first
 
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:19.170 align:start position:0%
thing please take out the swear words
 
01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:21.950 align:start position:0%
thing please take out the swear words
[Laughter]

01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
anyone else I I am representative
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards and maybe maybe this is uh this
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
is either to
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
um the witnesses or to uh the commit the
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner but
 
01:16:41.699 --> 01:16:42.590 align:start position:0%
commissioner but
um

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
do we have a form I imagine we must have
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
a formal process within DHHS or
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere that if things get really bad
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
at a given institution that we decertify
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
them for uh patient care do we do we
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
have a break glass way of
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
decertification of a facility and and
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
should we have one
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the terminology that
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're using but obviously um there are
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities licensing
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
um uh all of the critical access
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals this 13
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
rural small hospitals uh are certified
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
through state survey and certification
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
the other larger hospitals tend to use
 
01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:40.100 align:start position:0%
um another accrediting agency
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
such as the Joint Commission or dnv that
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
accredits them
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
um so the they they do that under the
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
federal CMS rules that allow them to to
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
be accredited to serve Medicare Medicaid
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
patients the state does license those
 
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.130 align:start position:0%
patients the state does license those
facilities

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
um so if that answers the question of
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
how that's right and those are the Hep
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
802 rules are the licensing rules and
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
they're pretty specific relative to what
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are required to make
 
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
maintain and administer in order to be
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
licensed which is an annual process so I
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
think it is a question for health
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
facilities under DHHS if to get more
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
specific but that that's our response
 
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that was 90 of the answer and
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not using the proper
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
semantics earlier but um so and so it
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
just leaves in my mind the the question
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
of process whether or not there is a
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
process available to uh to to pull a
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
credential or to remove a license and if
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
that is an ongoing process or if that
 
01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:55.699 align:start position:0%
has to be an ad hoc
 
01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
action by the department because they've
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
become aware of a problem right so it's
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
a process question and I don't know if
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
you can answer that or if the
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be best answered by the
 
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.189 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be best answered by the
department

01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm not suggesting it needs to
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
happen but just hearing uh the concerns
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
of Representative Nelson it just
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
triggers in my mind do do we have a
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
viability ongoing viability test to uh
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
withdraw a license if it should have
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
become necessary
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I I see the consultation back there
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
no no do you do you have anything you
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
want to say about and whether or not
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing process or a Nimble
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
ad hoc process to withdraw a license
 
01:19:58.610 --> 01:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
I had another one for you
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
just I'm the Medicaid director but also
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
a former Hospital executive I think that
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the survey and certification process
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
um is both a process and an incident for
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
example if there was a complaint
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
registered by someone made a complaint
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
to the department it could either be
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
picked up under the Medicare Medicaid
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
certification process or under a
 
01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:32.900 align:start position:0%
licensure process
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
and so it could be as a result of a
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
survey or it could be a result of a
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
reporting of an incident and I think we
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
could if you have more detailed
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
questions I think the person who
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
oversees that function for the
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
Department would be better to answer
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
your answer you specifically
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm at a high level yes or no and what I
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
heard I heard just heard you say is yes
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
there is a a Nimble process that if
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
necessary action can be taken to remove
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
a license from a health facility yes I
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
think that it goes through a process
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
before that would happen so for example
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
if they couldn't provide
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
oxygen or or water to be able to provide
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
care that might result in something but
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
to go to immediacy of removing a license
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's a that doesn't happen it's more
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
of a process
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
I was among the various conferences I
 
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
was sent to this summer one was on Rural
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
medicine where they faced the small
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
Hospital issues and this is all over the
 
01:21:45.719 --> 01:21:46.850 align:start position:0%
Hospital issues and this is all over the
country

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
shortages of staff and various creative
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
ways to see what one can do to alleviate
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
that and I might be interested
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
been a month or two a little report from
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
the Department indicating
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
what commissioner shibanet had shared
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
with me some time ago that there are
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
various issues various plans being
 
01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:14.780 align:start position:0%
looked at on how do we improve
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
Workforce and she was sharing some
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
interesting thoughts and it was
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
wonderful and it'd be nice to get some
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
update in a month or two on what are we
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
doing positive because there's no doubt
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
that representative Nelson's story is
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
being told all over the country
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's difficult to be the
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
patient I would guess it's at least as
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to be the providers who are
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
trying to do their best representative
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
Solway but thank you Mr chairman
 
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
Solway but thank you Mr chairman
um

01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:51.260 align:start position:0%
we are facing a
 
01:22:55.689 --> 01:22:55.699 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged tsunami in healthcare
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
we have been unable to staff our
 
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:05.300 align:start position:0%
hospitals with nursing staff
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
even here in New Hampshire some of our
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
Premier Health Care institutions are
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
staffed by and large with lnas rather
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
than RNs and as a result we rely on
 
01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
than RNs and as a result we rely on
Travelers

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
Travelers
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
um several concomitants uh wait times
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
for uh results wait times for
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
appointments have become
 
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:36.980 align:start position:0%
unconscionable putting patients at risk
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
at the same time Mr chairman we have the
 
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
Advent of a number of new uh pathogens
 
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
in our hospitals that we are having a
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
great deal of difficulty managing and
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
our rates of infection are being driven
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
by new pathogens and
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
Staffing by professionals who are not as
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
Adept at controlling infections as we
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
might hope
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is a coming crisis uh that each
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
of us is going to feel individually
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
and it is imperative that we find ways
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
here in Buffalo New Hampshire to
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
innovate our ways through this coming
 
01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.930 align:start position:0%
innovate our ways through this coming
tsunami

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
tsunami
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
and it may be the purview of this
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee to participate in that process
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to cut off discussion on this
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
topic and give Mr Allen the last word on
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
it before we move on to the next agenda
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
item I think uh no no no go ahead
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just want to say thank you
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%

01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
and representative Edwards I'd be happy
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%

01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
your unrelated question okay
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you New
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%

commission annual report
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
in keeping with our tradition here at
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
least one of the presenters must be
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement yes you think a word
 
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:41.420 align:start position:0%
shorter Workforce shortage is hard
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
specify they must be named Lori that
 
01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.310 align:start position:0%
specify they must be named Lori that
really

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay the chair now points himself acting
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for including us in
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
your presentations today uh my name is
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
Rory dos Diamond I'm the director at the
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
center of quality and safety at Southern
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire health and I'm the current
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
chair of the New Hampshire quality
 
01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:08.090 align:start position:0%
chair of the New Hampshire quality
Commission

01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm the Laurie I'm Lori Underwood
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief operating officer at New
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
London Hospital and I am the past chair
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Healthcare quality
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
and safety Commission
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
so you don't get a lorry as your new
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
chair but you do get an Ori of some sort
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
that's an acceptable variant thank you
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
so for a brief background of the
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
commission as a reminder we were
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature in June
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
of 2005 and it was to enable Health Care
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
Providers to share information about
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
adverse outcomes and prevention
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
strategies in a learning environment
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
which Fosters Candor and self-critical
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
Analysis while maintaining the
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of that information the
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
commission has evolved over the past 17
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
years to expand its scope we include
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
representation from each of the 26 acute
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
care hospitals in the state we have
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
added four specialty hospitals so that
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
includes two psychiatric hospitals and
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
two Rehabilitation hospitals and we also
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
now have representation from 20
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
freestanding Ambulatory Surgery
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
centers we also include three at-large
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
public members and a designee of the
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
the efforts of our commission are Guided
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
by four guiding principles which include
 
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:24.020 align:start position:0%
promoting High reliability organizations
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
establishing just cultures within our
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
organizations adopting evidence-based
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
best practices to improve outcomes and
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
incorporating the voice of the patient
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
so in some planar English let me cut in
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
for a minute to say that we do have a
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
written report that looks like this on
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
its cover so members we've got all of
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
this and can follow along with you we're
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
on page three thank you
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh so in some planner English promoting
 
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
High reliability organizations means
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
that we are proactively trying to put
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
processes and systems in place to reduce
 
01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:57.020 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of harm or error
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
establishing just cultures means that we
 
01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
are looking at our errors with an eye to
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
whether the error was produced by a
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
system issue or whether it was a result
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
of Reckless Behavior and that we are
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
approaching those errors with that in
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
mind evidence-based best practices I
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
like to say as we know better we do
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
better certainly the science evolves and
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
as we understand better things as we
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
have new technology to incorporate that
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
we do so and incorporating the voice of
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
the patient is rather self-explanatory
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I think having those three public
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
members on our commission has been
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful in giving us some of
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
that patient perspective as to how they
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
view the health care when they come into
 
01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
so um I'd like to just walk through a
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
few of the highlights of our year this
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
past year which are outlined in the
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
document that um that you have in front
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
of you
 
01:28:51.179 --> 01:28:52.689 align:start position:0%
of you
um

01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:52.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
let's start on page four starts on page
 
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:07.010 align:start position:0%
let's start on page four starts on page
four

01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to choose a few of the
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
highlights to give a little uh
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
information about and certainly if you
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
have any questions at any time please
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
ask them
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so during our commission year we had
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
a total of five meetings
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
these meetings I was here about a year
 
01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
ago presenting to you in the first year
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
of our covid response and I remember at
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
that time saying I really hoped that the
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
commission would be able to get back to
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
in-person meetings and unfortunately
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
with how things evolved through the year
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
we did not so our meetings continued to
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
be virtual through the year and I would
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to say one of the biggest pieces of
 
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
learning that we as Leaders of this
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
group have have achieved in the Years
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
how to run a virtual meeting with 50
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
people on the on the session it takes a
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
village to do that our discussion topics
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
and things that we spent a fair amount
 
01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:08.420 align:start position:0%
of time on
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
particularly included our covid-19
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
response continuing to look at the
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
impact of the functioning of our
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
facilities and the many ways that these
 
01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
were unprecedented In Our Lifetime as
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers and as support
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
providers in our organizations we saw
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
the highest number of cases beginning in
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
the at the beginning of the pandemic and
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
in the middle of this commission year
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
this really pushed hospitals Beyond its
 
01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:39.860 align:start position:0%
capacity particularly in critical care
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
non-icu settings were transitioned to
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
accommodate the influx of patients and
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
daily bed meetings occurred at the state
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
level to maintain situational awareness
 
01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:53.219 align:start position:0%
and facilitate Care at times during this
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
year there were no acute care or ICU
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
beds available in the entire State of
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
patients were being transferred to the
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
nearest available appropriate bed and
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
that could have been in Boston
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
Springfield Portland Maine or sometimes
 
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut so this was a daily issue
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
that we were all dealing with and as the
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
commission we were talking about what
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
that meant and how we assured the safety
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
of patients in those times nurses
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
shifted to team nursing models we of
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
course ended up in the situation in
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
which we always did not have enough
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
nurses we couldn't get enough enough
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
Travelers and we did not have the
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
ability to say we can't take care of you
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
we had to figure out ways to do that
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan was present at all of our
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
commission meetings he kept us appraised
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
of covid related prevalence and
 
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
infection prevention strategies
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
including the vaccine rollout which
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
happened through the year we also
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
discussed the extended response of what
 
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
covid would mean to our organizations as
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
as it shifted to an endemic state which
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
is very slowly happening
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
we also spent a lot of time on patient
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
safety ongoing adverse event review
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
hospital-associated infections reviewing
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
best practices that were happening in
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
organizations across the state
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
also looking at fire safety one of our
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
topics was fire safety on the whole
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
Advent of vaping pens was a big issue
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
because of course there's no smoking in
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
a hospital but
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
um those people who many of whom were
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
using vaping pens didn't consider that
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be smoking and so that was something
 
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
that we needed to address as well
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
we also talked not just about the
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
problems but about the success stories
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
and refocusing on best best practices
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
and what what we talk about in the
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
healthcare Industries those bundles are
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
things that we can do every time to be
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to assure the best outcomes we also
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
had pretty high staff turnover and high
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of traveler staff and we needed
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
to identify these opportunities to
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
remind our staff of the existing tools
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
and best practices that were in place
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
during this time and I think we talked a
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
little earlier about the person who
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
picks up the phone being the one who
 
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:33.380 align:start position:0%
takes sometimes the brunt of the issues
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
we also dealt with schools closing a lot
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
of our younger employees not being able
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
to work because they were home schooling
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
their children so that fueled some of
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
the turnover that we um that we all felt
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
through throughout the state in
 
01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
we talked at length about staffing
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
issues and what that impact was along
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic on not only our own
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
industry but other Industries around us
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
in our communities and those were were
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
very interesting conversations among all
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
of the different members
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
we tried to really talk about ways that
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
we could help our existing staff to not
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
leave that we could keep them that we
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
really wanted to keep our our existing
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
really awesome staff how we could help
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
them with learning more tools about
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
resilience how we could all be providing
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
them with good positive feedback about
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
their contributions to our patients care
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
and the the stories from across the
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
state were pretty amazing and many of us
 
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
were able to bring back new things to
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
our organizations that we may not have
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
thought about and that's really the
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
beauty of the commission and of coming
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
together is that we share fearlessly we
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
we and we steal from each other it's
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
actually mostly that we're willing to
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
give to each other and so I think that
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
has been the real benefit over all of
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
these years and I've personally been
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
involved with this commission for more
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
than 12 years
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
another challenge that our staff has has
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
faced over the last year that we've
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
talked about and the commission was
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
involved in a discussion at the
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislative legislative level is about
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
workplace safety and violence there's a
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
lot going on everybody's really
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
struggling with things that are going on
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
in our in our world right now
 
01:35:42.729 --> 01:35:42.739 align:start position:0%
um in that we were
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the discussions
 
01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.490 align:start position:0%
involved in the discussions
um

01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
and active in the Senate Bill 459
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislative development by providing
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
testimony on our discussions and
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
regarding the impact of workplace
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
violence on Health Care settings and we
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
aided in the development of the New
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthcare workplace safety
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
commission that is currently being
 
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.070 align:start position:0%
commission that is currently being
established

01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
when lastly one other area that we spent
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of time on was opioid
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
safety and certainly we all know what
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
has been going on in the world about
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
opioid safety and within the state we
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
are not immune from this we completed an
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
opioid safety best practice Gap analysis
 
01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
to determine the current state of of
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
Affairs in all of our organizations and
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know like Rory said we're we're
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
quite a mixed bag of Ambulatory Surgery
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
centers hospitals and many of our most
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
of our hospitals have physician
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
practices so really looking at the
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
utilization of opioids across all of
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
those and what is the best practice
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's happening now we had some
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
presentations on enhanced recovery after
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
surgery since that's a pretty big area
 
01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:56.900 align:start position:0%
in which opioids are used
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
and a lot of talk about what some very
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
Innovative practices that are happening
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the states
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we started to talk
 
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
about and probably will be continuing
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
through this year is the impact of
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
Health inequities on the quality of
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
patient care so that is where people
 
01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.590 align:start position:0%
patient care so that is where people
live

01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
um and all kinds of other
 
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.149 align:start position:0%
um and all kinds of other
um

01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
issues of Health Equity whether that be
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
education or language or age or ability
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
to pay and all of those things and
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
really trying to talk about how do we
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
assure that everyone is able to um to
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
access patient care regardless of all of
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
those things
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that was our last year it was a very
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
busy year we appreciate the support of
 
01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.950 align:start position:0%
busy year we appreciate the support of
this

01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
um this committee to can help allow us
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
to continue this work throughout the
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
state in a very protected way in that
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
protected way allows us to share in a
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
very open and honest
 
01:37:59.770 --> 01:37:59.780 align:start position:0%
um and an honest way that can really
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
impact Improvement through the
 
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
impact Improvement through the
organizations

01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to give you a bit of a
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
preview of uh perhaps next year and we
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
have already started the next commission
 
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
year our four guiding principles remain
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
the same we have included some language
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
related to Health Equity and focusing on
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
that within those four guiding
 
01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.689 align:start position:0%
that within those four guiding
principles

01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
principles
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
um we're going to continue our ongoing
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
discussions about the um Adverse Events
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
and adverse event reporting we are now
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
getting more current information from
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
Services about Statewide Trends which is
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
helping us to identify issues that we we
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
might want to bring for discussion to
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
the commission we will continue to
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
discuss Workforce shortage I don't think
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's going away anytime soon
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so it certainly has an
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
impact on Healthcare quality and patient
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
safety opioid best practices again will
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
continue our conversations about that we
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
also look at what's going on in the news
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
and we have conversations related to
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
those things recently there was the
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
finding in Tennessee where a nurse was
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
found criminally liable for a medication
 
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.570 align:start position:0%
found criminally liable for a medication
error

01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
error
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
um that's concerning to us from the
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
perspective that in order to improve
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
quality we need to know what those
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
errors are that are happening and we
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
need to know about near-misses maybe the
 
01:39:16.129 --> 01:39:16.139 align:start position:0%
error didn't happen but it came close to
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
happening if we're not aware of that
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to get ahead of it and
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
put in those best practices to help
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
close the Swiss cheese as we say
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is one thing that we're
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
concerned about certainly drug diversion
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
has come up recently in the news that's
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
another concern in terms of not only
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
keeping our patients safe with opioids
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
but keeping our staff
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
um safe and going back to what Laurie
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the beginning that we have
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
been meeting via Zoom we are hoping this
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
year will be the year where we will be
 
01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:49.580 align:start position:0%
able to start meeting in person again
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
we've managed to have a very robust
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
conversation in a virtual format however
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
there's really a lot to be said for the
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
community building the connections that
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
we make in that in-person setting the
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
relationships that we build the trust
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we build with our colleagues and
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
the power of being able to know those
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
faces those names and the the people
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
that you can pick up the phone and give
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
a call and say hey have you ever run
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
how did you handle it what can we learn
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
from your experience
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question on page five
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
um bullet point three line three
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
um the violence against health care
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
workers is increasing uh do you see this
 
01:40:35.649 --> 01:40:35.659 align:start position:0%
is a blip because of the
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
psychological pressure everybody is
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
under because of the pandemic or do you
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
see this is a trend that is continuing
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
even when the pandemic Ebbs
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that it's a trend related to
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I think part of the what the
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission has uncovered and we added
 
01:40:58.370 --> 01:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
workplace violence reporting I don't
 
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
know how many years ago to the adverse
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
event reporting
 
01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:02.890 align:start position:0%
event reporting
um

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:02.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
so we have certainly seen an increase in
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
reporting and awareness and I think
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes that increases the awareness
 
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
that is happening it doesn't necessarily
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
mean that there is more violence but
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
certainly within the last couple of
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
years we have seen an increase in the
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
actual interactions that are negative
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
patients are waiting longer in emergency
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
departments that influences their
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
experience I think what we were speaking
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
about previously with limited visitors
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's had a major impact on what our
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
staff is dealing with with upset
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
patients is there anybody else from the
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
committee have a question for Lori and
 
01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:42.109 align:start position:0%
committee have a question for Lori and
Rory

01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
I have a comment about the safety
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
the the legislature uh approved and the
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
governor is signed an enhancement to the
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
the workforce violence commissions
 
01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.229 align:start position:0%
the workforce violence commissions
um

01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
membership and the ability of them to
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
ensure the participation of those on the
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
commission so so the legislature when we
 
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
reviewed the workforce violence issue we
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
determined that it was important to uh
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
to go ahead because this is an ongoing
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
problem from our perspective to to
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
enhance the ability of the community the
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals to to to do what they can to
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
identify it and to ameliorate it was
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
that SB 459 or something else I I I'm
 
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:35.780 align:start position:0%
horrible with Bill numbers it was
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
Laurie minahan thank you
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
I know that all right thank you Laurie
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
and Rory for coming up and making your
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
presentation and giving us a nice
 
01:42:56.689 --> 01:42:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
following up on Senate Bill 292 of 2019
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
and you will report on the
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
implementation of New Hampshire's
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
10-year Mental Health Plan and we have a
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
handout on that I believe and this will
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
as Jerry Seinfeld would say not that
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
so good morning uh this is
 
01:43:42.719 --> 01:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
so good morning uh this is
um

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
a privilege to be before you and provide
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
this update I'm Katya Fox I'm the
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
01:43:49.619 --> 01:43:51.290 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
Health

01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
and good morning I'm Julianne carbon the
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
director for the Bureau of Mental Health
 
01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.629 align:start position:0%
director for the Bureau of Mental Health
Services

01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do this morning is
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
we want to pull out some highlights of
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
areas that have had significant progress
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the last year and as we do that we
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
think about the 10-year plan we are
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
three and a half years into the plan
 
01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:15.500 align:start position:0%
just about
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
and as part of that the legislation the
 
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
law contemplates us doing reviews
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
periodic reviews that we just don't come
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
in here annually and say Here's Where We
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
Are you know here's here's our progress
 
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
but that we as a department and we as a
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
state look at that plan and see what is
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
still relevant and what we may have
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
missed so the environment as you know
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
has changed in the last three and a half
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
years we expect further change and so
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
we're currently undergoing that review
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
we've been talking and engaging with
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and are looking forward to
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
being able to report out on what has
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
been identified either as a gap or an
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
area that is doing really well and needs
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
more infusion of resources and also to
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
look at what what didn't uh
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
pan out so we're undergoing that and the
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
full report is forthcoming and so again
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to go we just pulled out
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
some highlights you have the handout but
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to be succinct and my parking
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
meter runs out in a little bit so we'll
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
get through this and be happy to
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
okay so again a few of the highlights
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
from from the last year include the
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
transformation of our crisis response
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
system as many of you are aware we
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
launched New Hampshire rapid response
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
that went live Statewide on January 1st
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
and it includes those three components
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
the first is the centralized access
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
point that provides
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
um support assessment and triage via
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
phone text and chat functionalities and
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
then the ability to deploy mobile
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
response teams into the community this
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
this system was really built to address
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
the needs of children youth adults and
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
families who are experiencing mental
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
health or a substance use crisis
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
and it's quite remarkable actually in in
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
the last six months more than 16 000
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
people around the state have made
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
contact with our access point and that
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
has result resulted in more than 4 000
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
community-based deployments
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
um so we are continuing to work with our
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
partners and the system has integrated
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the launch of 988 which took place
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
nationally in in July
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
the department has also made some
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
significant progress in expanding our
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
community-based services and housing
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
supports for both adults and children
 
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
and families and a few of the highlights
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
from the last year include expansion of
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
our fast forward program this program
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
really is designed to provide intensive
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
wraparound services for children youth
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
and families who are experiencing
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
challenges with day-to-day life due to
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
Serious emotional and disturbances in
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
their families and and it really serves
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth who are at risk for
 
01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
acute psychiatric hospitalization or
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Services again as
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
as we indicated that program has seen
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
significant growth in the last year
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
alone we've had an approximately 23
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
percent increase in enrollment of
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
families in the program
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of supported housing the
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
department did increase our rates our
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
per diem supported housing rates by
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 88 in the last year in an
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
effort to better support providers to
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.689 --> 01:47:44.699 align:start position:0%
we did contract within last year to
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
expand supported housing programs in
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
each of the regions to implement six new
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
beds and as of today we you know each of
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
those programs have been working really
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
hard to identify locations and Staffing
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
to get those programs up and running and
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
we have 20 of the 60 beds open and
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
occupied today which we see as a
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
significant process progress given given
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
the environment that we're working
 
01:48:08.219 --> 01:48:10.910 align:start position:0%
the environment that we're working
Within

01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
Within
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
lastly a significant community-based
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
support that we were able to launch is
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
our critical time intervention or CTI
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
that was made available Statewide as of
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
this past July and CTI is an
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program that supports
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
people through their transition from
 
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.370 align:start position:0%
people through their transition from
inpatient

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:30.380 align:start position:0%
inpatient
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
inpatient care into the community it
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
provides short-term really intensive
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
Support Services with the intention of
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
reducing readmissions to an inpatient
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
hospital so those are just a few of the
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
community-based services that we've
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
really seen some significant growth in
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
the last year
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
and uh you heard earlier from our Deputy
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioner on the update of Hampstead
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
obviously that was a very significant
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking and part of our 10-year plan
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
and our vision for the mental health
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
system in the state the last one that I
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to pull out and mention is the
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
IMD waiver for mental health this is
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that we have worked we've had
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder waiver from the
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
federal government and we added mental
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
health beds to this waiver as well and
 
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
that we've worked with our federal
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
partner CMS on establishing that and
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
what does that do that allows us to be
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to have a Medicaid reimbursement
 
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:42.980 align:start position:0%
for beds in facilities that are over 16
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
beds and so we made some significant
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
progress on that and that
 
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
also is in the process right now of we
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
have to re it's along Henry can explain
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
it better but it expires so it only has
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time so we have
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
mended the substance use disorder IMD
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
waiver and with the mental health
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
component and now it's going to be up
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
for Renewal next year so we've already
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
started that process of the extension
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
under the request and one of the
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
exciting things that happened as a
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
result of this is that we are working
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Corrections and
 
01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
adding a piece and requesting that there
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
be discrete Services care coordination
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
services for a community re-entry
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
program where we can have that care
 
01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
coordination reimbursed and this is for
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
individuals 45 up to 45 days before they
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
are returning to the community and it's
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
not a full-blown Medicaid benefit for 45
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
days prior to release it's really
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
focused on that coordination of services
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
and getting someone ready to be able to
 
01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:04.139 align:start position:0%
return to the community and be
 
01:51:04.139 --> 01:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
return to the community and be
successful

01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
and so that's that concludes our remarks
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
I do want to recognize everyone who has
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
been involved in this process there have
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
been policy makers there have been
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
Community leaders Advocates individuals
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
who've been impacted by mental health
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
and all of our providers who've really
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
made this work and be successful and
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
serve thousands of people across the
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
state however we know that we continue
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of work to do and we look
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
forward to being able to talk about that
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
and demonstrating
 
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
similar progress
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going forward
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:52.550 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
chair

01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
um so on recommendation four I think
 
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is probably where you were talking
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
about the mobile Vans and the the pack
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we've touched 16 000 people is that
 
01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay so because
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I I am not good with Bill numbers uh
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the future if we put a like a
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 14 could we add the year
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
that it was passed because that number
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be reused right absolutely
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right and and so if if
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
we can make it even simpler by if we're
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
talking about the mobile van maybe put
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
the word mobile van in there and it'll
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
just be easier to do a quick read on
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
this well in in to be fair though under
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
that it's a whole array of services
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
um under the children's system of care
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
so um so you but Point well taken oh
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay and and the reason I'm I'm I'm
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
sticking my finger in the mobile van one
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
is because I've put a few requests out
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
to get a summary of all of the Vans
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
because it feels to me like we have
 
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
funded Vans under different line items
 
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the budget and I just want to at some
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
point maybe in the budget process in
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
February get a comprehensive review of
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
all of the mobile Vans and and all of
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
the metrics that you guys are
 
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
accumulating it's a super concept it's
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
been fun funding this but I just would
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
like to make sure we get a good program
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
review absolutely and just from a
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
deployment and the implementation they
 
01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
aren't physical Vans necessarily I think
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
a couple programs have bands but because
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the nature of this they don't know
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
what community they're responding to and
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
so they're on call and then and then
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
respond individually they are mobile
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
however they very idea being that
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
individuals and families are served in
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
their communities we do have statistics
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that yesterday and
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
we have handouts that we have that
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
address the cumulative effect but I want
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're starting to talk about we need to
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
see where the deployments are happening
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
where are the calls coming from we do
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about the deployments
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
and whether it's children and adults but
 
01:54:19.729 --> 01:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
we have such Rich data that we need to
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
start Mining and we know that we want to
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
share that with you through the budget
 
01:54:24.719 --> 01:54:27.470 align:start position:0%
share that with you through the budget
process

01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
next is plan for dental care and for
 
01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:42.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
and our friend Henry lippman
 
01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
and our other friend Dr Sarah Finney
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
I was thinking of changing my name to
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
Lori but I think my parents would be
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
helpful I actually knew an
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
l-a-u-r-i-e masculine spelling of but
 
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
um for the record Henry lippman State's
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
and Dr Sarah Finney the Medicaid dental
 
01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.790 align:start position:0%
and Dr Sarah Finney the Medicaid dental
director

01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
so I guess as a starting point I think
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
in terms of the expectations of standing
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
up the dental program for April 1st that
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've made significant progress and I'm
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
gonna let Dr Finney walk you through the
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
one-page handout that hopefully you have
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
a little too
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
and representative Edwards I gave you
 
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
two copies you probably did
 
01:55:48.300 --> 01:56:00.770 align:start position:0%
two copies you probably did
um

01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.850 --> 01:56:03.860 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm taking it from the top
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh we're required to post a request for
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
information or RFI by August and we met
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
that deadline and actually posted the
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
RFI July 11th the answers were due back
 
01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.050 align:start position:0%
RFI July 11th the answers were due back
in

01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
um rather quickly we followed up with
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
the request for proposals after that
 
01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
which has been posted as of August 25th
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
and the responses for that are due at
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
the end of September on the 30th
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know we realized that we have a very
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
tight timeline to go through all of this
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
and we're really condensing everything
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
as much as possible
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
we'll be spending the time between
 
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
September and January working on our
 
01:56:51.850 --> 01:56:51.860 align:start position:0%
rules development and approval
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
as well as working on
 
01:56:59.169 --> 01:56:59.179 align:start position:0%
the Contracting process so that we can
 
01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
make a presentation at governor and
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
Council towards the end of October
 
01:57:07.810 --> 01:57:07.820 align:start position:0%
November early December depending on how
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Contracting process proceeds
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
we are currently working on all of the
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
paperwork that we have to submit to CMS
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
so our state plan Amendment the waivers
 
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
that we need to file
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
um and on various other paperwork with
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
them is in process and we're going back
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
and forth in conversation with CMS so
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we have all of that completed in
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
time as Henry already said April 1st is
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
our implementation date and we are
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
standing by that and working to make
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
sure that that occurs
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
according to the final legislation that
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
was signed into law the department will
 
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
be presenting an annual report to this
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee to give an update on how the
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
process of implementation went how the
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
utilization is being managed and various
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
other indicators of progress and success
 
01:58:10.810 --> 01:58:10.820 align:start position:0%
with the program
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
I've given you the links you also should
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
have received an electronic copy of this
 
01:58:19.129 --> 01:58:19.139 align:start position:0%
but the links are here to the RFI and
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
the RFP should you want to go and take a
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
look at all of the documents that are
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
attached to those and then the last link
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page takes you
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
directly to the signed legislation if
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
you want to refer back to exactly what
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
was included in that so I don't know if
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
representative soloway Mr lippman Dr
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
Finney uh this is just wonderful to hear
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
please forgive my impatience do you have
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
any notion of what the response is
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
you know how many bidders you might get
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
whether anybody's talked to you about
 
01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
we're planning on submitting your
 
01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:04.850 align:start position:0%
we're planning on submitting your
proposal

01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
and I beg of you forgive my impatience
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
I think we probably can leave it that we
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
have at participants
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
um in both the RFI process and that it's
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
we ask for letters of intent but it's
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
not a requirement one thing I would
 
01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:24.659 align:start position:0%
um that we posted is that you know the
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
model that is in the RFP is a model of a
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
dental organization
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
um meaning that it will be a standalone
 
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
outside of the current Managed Care
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
organizations but the Managed Care
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
organizations who have dental arms can
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
bid on that as well
 
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping for a good responses I
 
01:59:45.129 --> 01:59:45.139 align:start position:0%
guess is what
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
I had breakfast with uh Thomas Raphael
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
recently and we amazingly discussed
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
dental care and I raised the question a
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
bill is as good as the number of
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
dentists who are willing to do this and
 
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
he and I expressed concern and we also
 
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
expressed as a follow-up
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
what practical things can we do to
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
encourage more dentists
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
and more dentists to participate and I'm
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
leaving that as an open question worthy
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
of exploration not that you haven't
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
thought of it
 
02:00:23.689 --> 02:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
I I would just comment uh briefly that
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
there are two aspects in the bill that
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
that address that one is that the
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
financing of it allowed for a rate
 
02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
increase to bring our rates up more
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
normative to what's expected in Medicaid
 
02:00:37.729 --> 02:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly the the care
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
coordination and transportation
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
component to make sure that if a dentist
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
is willing to see a patient that the
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
chair actually gets an appointment
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I I would just add to that that
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of Advocates across
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
the state who realize the importance of
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
having an adequate provider Network and
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
they are addressing that you know from
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
their particular Viewpoint so I think
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
that there's a number of ways that that
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
message is being
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
um sent to our dental providers and
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will listen and respond
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
is there any are there any plans afoot
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
oh to do loan forgiveness for a dentist
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
who will resettle to this area for X
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
number of years and we'll take X number
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid patients at as a matter of
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
fact we made a significant change to the
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment program that the
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
state has which we lovingly refer to as
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
slurp and we now have several different
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for dentists to enter that
 
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
program and we are doing that in an
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
effort to try to keep to bring dentists
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
to the state and also keep them here
 
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any demographics on dentists
 
02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
do you have any demographics on dentists
who

02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:50.570 align:start position:0%
who
um

02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
are participating presently in terms of
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
age my fear is that some of them may be
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh that we we do it's it's an
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
ever-changing thing
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the interesting things that
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
occurred with over the last several
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
years is that we had some Advanced uh
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
speed of retirement and then some folks
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
actually deciding to come back into
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
practice so I'd say we're you know
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
there's an in and out uh but we are
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
constantly watching
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you know where our numbers are
 
02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
another there's there's two other things
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
that I do want to
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
um let you know uh besides the student
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
loan repayment we do have the department
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
has a contract to do
 
02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
um recruiting of dentists through some
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
assistance from Bi-State Primary Care
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
Association so this is another way that
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
we're reaching out to dental students
 
02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.209 align:start position:0%
we're reaching out to dental students
and

02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
um general practice residency graduates
 
02:02:58.970 --> 02:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
to try to encourage them to come to the
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
state and then the other thing which
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
will be happening next summer we will
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
have our first group of general practice
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
residency dentists in the state which
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
have not been here for the last 10 to 15
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
years and that is another mechanism
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
where they rotate through locations in
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
the state and hopefully we will retain
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
them here once they finish their program
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
would would you take that part of your
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
presentation which addresses my question
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
on what are you doing to get more
 
02:03:35.169 --> 02:03:35.179 align:start position:0%
dentists in and make it email to us
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
because this is a keeper okay any other
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Lipman and Dr Finney
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so I I think this is a great program
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh the only part that causes me to lose
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
any sleep at night I mean the Manpower
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
is certainly a key piece but but I
 
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the the fact that we got verbal
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
approvals on the two CMS waivers
 
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
still leaves me uncertain that when we
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
file the official paperwork that we're
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
going to get formal approvals of our
 
02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
waiver requests and so is is this an
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
irrational fear on my part or do I need
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
to quit worrying about CMS approving our
 
02:04:26.570 --> 02:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
waivers you think that's what that's
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
what my job is is to worry about all
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
that and and Henry I just want to let
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm helping you with the
 
02:04:35.689 --> 02:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
worrying part
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think we're very confident
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
um based on our interactions that we're
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to get there as with any state
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
plan Amendment sometimes takes us quite
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
a few exchanges of How It's worded to
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
get to where we want to go but I think
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the clear policy issues
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to address when you
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
drafted the provisions that were
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable those are uh statutory and
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
Regulatory within the bounds of which
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
standing with them that they are
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
reviewing to be you know just to make
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
sure that the teaser crossed eyes dotted
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot so that is an ongoing
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:24.290 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
chairman

02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
um Ms Ms Finney and Mr lippen uh
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
the timeline for implementation that
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
states here at table first but they then
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
there will be an annual report and
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
knowing that we deal with with the
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
budgets as
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
I would have been alluded to coming up
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
very very quickly what's the date then
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
of the annual report
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh based on the implementation starting
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
April April 1st of next year I believe
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
it was um to be a yearly report so we
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
would want to be one year in so
 
02:05:59.290 --> 02:05:59.300 align:start position:0%
April 1st of 24
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
because we need to have some
 
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
important functioning of the the plan to
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
be able to report to you and as far as
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
the funding goes
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
um this benefit was funded with the sun
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
teen settlement funds and so we are
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
covered for the next biennium budget for
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
this benefit with those funds and just
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
follow up its General follow-up uh
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that the sentine
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
settlement is not in perpetuity I uh in
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
all seriousness was looking here from a
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
planning going uh going forward
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
well the
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
um in the annual report have that
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
functional cost benefit
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh analysis to show the cost savings and
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
that in time for when CMS does their
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
review of approving the waiver each time
 
02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.330 align:start position:0%
review of approving the waiver each time
that's

02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
um does that meet their timeline so we
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
don't have that battle during budget
 
02:06:57.659 --> 02:06:58.370 align:start position:0%
don't have that battle during budget
time

02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
um we're we're prepared to report on a
 
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
frequency basis that exceeds what was
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
required in statute so
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
um in terms of keeping this committee
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
informed you were very helpful to
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
advancing the benefit and couldn't have
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
done it without you and so we want to
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're giving you the
 
02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
information so that
 
02:07:21.050 --> 02:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
you have what you need to advocate for
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
the continuation of the benefit past the
 
02:07:26.209 --> 02:07:26.219 align:start position:0%
the funding that we already have so
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
um we're going to make sure that you're
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
getting what you need to to do that for
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
us we appreciate appreciate that and
 
02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so that's in the
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
commitment I mean just so I can be
 
02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
counted when needed you can count that
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
as a commitment sir yeah it'll be done
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're complying with a
 
02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:44.649 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're complying with a
CMS

02:07:44.649 --> 02:07:44.659 align:start position:0%
CMS
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
adjustment of criteria not only CMS but
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
just in terms of what the expectations
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
around what the benefit costs and and
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
what we would be providing for it um you
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
know I think the workforce challenge is
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
probably it extends into the dental
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
practice Arena as well and you know I
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
think that probably our primary concern
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
is even if we have good access in terms
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
of contractually in terms of what are
 
02:08:11.930 --> 02:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
the wait times due to the Staffing
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's available in in dentist office
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
but you know we'll we'll keep you
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
apprised of that as well thank you sir
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
and finally the DD and ABD wait list
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for having us
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm Melissa Hardy I am the
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
director for the division of long-term
 
02:08:49.729 --> 02:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Sandy farrows the bureau chief at
 
02:08:54.649 --> 02:08:54.659 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental services
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
for those looking at the agenda you're
 
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
listed as Sandy furrows yes yes just
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
make sure thank you
 
02:09:06.609 --> 02:09:06.619 align:start position:0%
I knew that but I
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we are here to give an
 
02:09:11.450 --> 02:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
update on the home and community-based
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
Care waivers which allow us to support
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
and acquired brain disorder in the
 
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
and acquired brain disorder in the
community

02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're reporting through June 30th which
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
is the end of fiscal year 22 and I'm
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
happy to report that we were able to
 
02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:29.900 align:start position:0%
identify funding and allocate funding to
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
797 individuals for fiscal year
 
02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.890 align:start position:0%
797 individuals for fiscal year
2022

02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
2022
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
69 of those individuals are people that
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
required additional services
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
26 of those people were new and aging
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
into the system and five percent are
 
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
people that were brand new to servicing
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of state or maybe
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
losing resources that they may have had
 
02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:07.850 align:start position:0%
losing resources that they may have had
previously

02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
so for those individuals that were
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
allocated funding I know that one of the
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions was around whether or not
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
people were able to actually start
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
services and we were able to identify
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
that 71 percent did start
 
02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
29 percent are waiting on identifying
 
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
services and for those that haven't
 
02:10:30.169 --> 02:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
started their services the consistent
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
issue which we've talked about a lot
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
this morning has to do with the
 
02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
staff and provider Recruitment and
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
identification identification of an
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
agency that can provide the services
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
so that's consistent across both
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
populations the developmental
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities population as well as
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
people with acquired acquired brain
 
02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:53.390 align:start position:0%
people with acquired acquired brain
disorder

02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
02:10:56.649 --> 02:10:56.659 align:start position:0%
so for the In-Home Support waiver which
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically supports children with
 
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities we were able
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
to allocate funding for 69 children in
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22.
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
86 percent of those were Aging in new to
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
services and 14 were receiving enhanced
 
02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.390 align:start position:0%
services and 14 were receiving enhanced
services

02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
of those individuals that received the
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
allocated funding 82 percent were able
 
02:11:24.169 --> 02:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
to begin services
 
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
and these are the students that that
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
leave school and then receive services
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
in their communities
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
18 percent
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
are waiting for services and again the
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
same issue around Workforce
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
is for that population as well and then
 
02:11:43.689 --> 02:11:43.699 align:start position:0%
for finally for acquired brain disorder
 
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
for State fiscal year 22 we identified
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
funding for 44 people
 
02:11:52.609 --> 02:11:52.619 align:start position:0%
and again 89 percent
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
um oh excuse me 67 percent
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
receive services and 33 of that
 
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
population are waiting for their
 
02:12:02.290 --> 02:12:02.300 align:start position:0%
services to begin
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
so those are our numbers in terms of
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
people that were allocated funding on
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
all three waivers and
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
I would say the people waiting for
 
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
services are consistent with our last
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
report about 20 percent
 
02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
waiting for services to begin for the DD
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
population and the ABD
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the wait list
 
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
under McMahon thank you Mr chairman
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
and is it MS furos
 
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
yes Ms pharaohs is fine I want to make
 
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
sure I pronounce it correctly uh
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
um relative to those who are waiting uh
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
one of the main criteria was rates of
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
pay not getting enough uh
 
02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
Professional Services to step up in this
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
regard is that still the case that
 
02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:01.619 align:start position:0%
you're finding uh or or not at this
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
point yes we hear that often from
 
02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:07.460 align:start position:0%
providers and from agencies
 
02:13:10.609 --> 02:13:10.619 align:start position:0%
follow up that being said and I've been
 
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
doing my own talk about it to say where
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
do we need to be based on enhancing and
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
the uh attractiveness of this very
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
important job is one way to pay would
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
you be recommending or have you
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
discussed to
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
entice the professionals to take these
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
positions that ultimately save the state
 
02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
literally millions of dollars in the
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
aggregate by home and community-based
 
02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:34.850 align:start position:0%
aggregate by home and community-based
care

02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
so what's the rate of pay that we need
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
to consider going forward
 
02:13:42.530 --> 02:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
the rate of pay varies across provider
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
agencies and area agencies and of course
 
02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
there are other things to consider like
 
02:13:48.169 --> 02:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
benefit packages and things that
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
providers have been able to identify one
 
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the challenges is that we don't have
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
a an updated rate methodology and we are
 
02:13:58.370 --> 02:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
currently undergoing
 
02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
currently undergoing
um

02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
a data collection process also known as
 
02:14:05.209 --> 02:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
the cost survey where we within the
 
02:14:07.129 --> 02:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
bureau are working closely with our
 
02:14:10.729 --> 02:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
agencies to identify the cost of
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
delivering services so that we can
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
contribute to a new rate methodology and
 
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
that I'm optimistic that that will help
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
give providers a rate that's appropriate
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can reimburse their
 
02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:23.149 align:start position:0%
so that they can reimburse their
Workforce

02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
and just in closing will that be done
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
while we're young
 
02:14:29.770 --> 02:14:29.780 align:start position:0%
get it done while we're young yes
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
no I'm not old I'm aggressively mature
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm just looking here as this that's
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
been discussed quite a bit in all
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
seriousness it has can that be a not can
 
02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
be is it not a Target to have it done
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
this year because of this critical uh
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
accessibility for for Workforce growth
 
02:14:51.169 --> 02:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
the target for the closure of that data
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
collection is November of this year so
 
02:14:56.350 --> 02:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
once we have the data we'll be able to
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
work with our rate setting vendor and
 
02:15:02.689 --> 02:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
our actuary to start looking at their
 
02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that would be ready
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
for the budget consideration
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the next two-year budget cycle yes
 
02:15:11.890 --> 02:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
that's what we're hoping
 
02:15:15.169 --> 02:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
you're hoping or committed to
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
but now it's seriousness yeah I would
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
have to I would have to
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure it depends on the data
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
that comes back but we would like to
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
have that for the next budget cycle for
 
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
sure all right and my last thing on that
 
02:15:30.169 --> 02:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately is Asap November 1st or
 
02:15:31.729 --> 02:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
November 30th
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
first okay thank you very much you're
 
02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:35.930 align:start position:0%

welcome
 
02:15:39.169 --> 02:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add um we also you know
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
recognize and understand the workforce
 
02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
shortage but we have also provided
 
02:15:48.169 --> 02:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
um over 20 million dollars to our area
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
agencies for Staffing recruiting
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
retention and training bonuses the
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
one-time arpa money
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
um to hopefully enhance
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
um one-time money for people to come
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
into the workforce but we understand you
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
know that people are looking for a
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
long-term plan to find folks to do the
 
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
work but we we have looked at those
 
02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
opportunities and funding streams
 
02:16:10.739 --> 02:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
opportunities and funding streams
yeah

02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
population is dear to my heart for a
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
number of reasons and I've tried to
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
facilitate a coming together between the
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
department and the families of people in
 
02:16:38.049 --> 02:16:38.059 align:start position:0%
need over the issue of the redesign
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
my policy committee loves to square
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
circles we love to vote things out
 
02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
unanimously we don't every time get
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
everybody happy but we lessen the mildly
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
annoyed level as much as we can and
 
02:16:55.969 --> 02:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
could you give me an update on how this
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
is uh unfolding yes so um thank you for
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
that I like that mildly annoyed we'll
 
02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
Target for that but certainly um just a
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
brief update for our stakeholder
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
engagement we do have ongoing meetings
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
with our stakeholders so those would be
 
02:17:14.169 --> 02:17:14.179 align:start position:0%
our providers our area agencies
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and families
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
um that that that support the
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
developmental disability community so
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
monthly we have
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
um stakeholder stakeholder work group
 
02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
meetings we have an advisory committee a
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
waiver committee looking and providing
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
input on the the redesign of the waivers
 
02:17:33.059 --> 02:17:34.310 align:start position:0%
input on the the redesign of the waivers
waiver

02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have our rates committee and also a
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
committee on communication
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
assessment so we have we've had
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
um to date nearly over 50 different
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
meetings as it relates to those advisory
 
02:17:46.679 --> 02:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
meetings as it relates to those advisory
committees

02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
we've held earlier this summer 10
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
Regional in person forums in different
 
02:17:58.310 --> 02:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
locations for individuals and families
 
02:18:00.169 --> 02:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk to us at The Bureau
 
02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:04.139 align:start position:0%
about the redesign answer questions have
 
02:18:06.049 --> 02:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
information out there so we're planning
 
02:18:07.969 --> 02:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
on doing another round of those
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
in-person meetings targeting individuals
 
02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
and families starting in October so us
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
going out into the community also having
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
a virtual option for those meetings as
 
02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
well for folks that can't make it in
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
person but really find that you know
 
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
talking to the individuals and families
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
that receive service and you know truly
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of the services in the
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
community is really helpful for us for
 
02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:31.009 align:start position:0%
community is really helpful for us for
feedback

02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
we also in September
 
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
um released our first BDS newsletter
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
which went extensively over the redesign
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
process based on the feedback from our
 
02:18:44.509 --> 02:18:44.519 align:start position:0%
family meetings so did you send me one I
 
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
did would you send me another one I get
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
300 emails a day thank you absolutely
 
02:18:52.730 --> 02:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
um so that went out earlier this month
 
02:18:54.650 --> 02:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
and we proposed we're going to continue
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
that on a quarterly basis just as a
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
standard communication not necessarily
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
focused just on the redesign but
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
information from the bureau as a whole
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh we also
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
um have
 
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
um our consultant and Sandy have gone
 
02:19:13.370 --> 02:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
out to some of the the sites talking to
 
02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
the era agencies and providers and into
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
individuals and families
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
um going out to them and listening to
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
them as well we have some information
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
sections virtually that I believe you
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
participated in recently so we have
 
02:19:30.889 --> 02:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
those as well for individuals and
 
02:19:30.899 --> 02:19:33.049 align:start position:0%
those as well for individuals and
Families

02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
Families
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
um and certainly working with the
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
community supports Network on on a
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
regular basis which is the Trade
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
Organization for the area agencies
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
talking with them on a routine basis as
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
well so that's some of our stakeholder
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
engagement but certainly open to
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
anyone's suggestions for for further
 
02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
anyone's suggestions for for further
engagement

02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
02:19:56.690 --> 02:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
my question would be and it's a compound
 
02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
my question would be and it's a compound
question

02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
because of this process and because of
 
02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:01.969 align:start position:0%
because of this process and because of
your

02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
really doing extra amount of Engagement
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
do you can you say that
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
in some way or other your
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
redesign has been modified and can you
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
say in some degree the stakeholder
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
upsettedness has been mollified so
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's modified modified that was pretty
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
clever but are you coming to better
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
place do you in your opinion yes and I
 
02:20:38.809 --> 02:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
hope it does continue to to get better
 
02:20:40.969 --> 02:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
um a good example of that is from our
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
advisory committee we had a direct
 
02:20:45.650 --> 02:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
support professional subcommittee Who
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
provided the department with
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how we move forward
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the DSP Workforce and so we Sandy
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
just held a advisory committee yesterday
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
to review those recommendations for the
 
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and getting the advisory
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
committee's feedback on how we proceed
 
02:21:03.010 --> 02:21:03.020 align:start position:0%
with those recommendations
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
also in the original redesign there was
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
talk about a two two waiver service
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
So based on the feedback from our
 
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and committees we put the
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
development of that second waiver on
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
pause so we can work
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
um you know at our developing and
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
refining our developmental disabilities
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
waiver and focusing on the work that
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
needs to get done
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
my ear to the ground except for people
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
who get up in the morning looking for
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
reasons to be angry
 
02:21:37.969 --> 02:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
and they exist
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
my sense is there is appreciation of
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
your listening and there is in many
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
people a willingness to come this way
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
because they see you're coming this way
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to say let's let's continue
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
this but I'm happy to see progress right
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the feedback
 
02:22:01.730 --> 02:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
anything else representative Edwards
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
yeah hi I I would uh like to talk about
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing I talk about every time
 
02:22:17.410 --> 02:22:17.420 align:start position:0%
which is the visual information provided
 
02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
and I I love the fact that you are
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
talking in terms of percentages of you
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
know who's being seen and who we're
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
having some issues with but I I just
 
02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
need to take issue with the handout as
 
02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
need to take issue with the handout as
written

02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think we've talked about this
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
before but I I wasn't very specific
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
where it says developmental disabilities
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
wait list
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a wait list this is uh as I
 
02:22:51.050 --> 02:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
understand it a statistical summary of
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
funding shortages
 
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
and so like when we look at the right
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
side of the graph there are zero funding
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
shortages but there are in fact a
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
waiting list for reasons that we can't
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
control but there is a wait list out
 
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
there so so I'm concerned that the way
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is headed it is subject to having
 
02:23:16.490 --> 02:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
the public misinterpret it and I just
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
want some element of transparency I
 
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
would like our visual information to be
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh precise but do you have a comment on
 
02:23:25.319 --> 02:23:26.389 align:start position:0%
uh precise but do you have a comment on
that

02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would say what was provided
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said it's it shows that
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
everyone has been funded for services
 
02:23:36.250 --> 02:23:36.260 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that as Sandy said
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
receiving services so we can work on
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
that visual for you okay so that's a
 
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
simple one that's just changing the two
 
02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
uses of the word wait list to funding
 
02:23:48.290 --> 02:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
shortage or or something that you think
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate but and then the
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:00.380 align:start position:0%
have you all been able to conceptualize
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
a graphical way of representing these
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
percentages that are causing us to have
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
a real wait list
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know what what what the causes are
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
for maybe I just got handed the what I'm
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
exactly asking about
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
so what's what's being handed out now is
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
just a graphic representation of the
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
percentages that that I shared with you
 
02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
and we're not sure if this would be
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
helpful or if it would be desired but if
 
02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is to your liking we can continue
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
presenting this representative um you'll
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
see DD waiver in-home supports waiver
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
and ABD waiver all on their own page
 
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
there's a pie chart that represents the
 
02:24:47.210 --> 02:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
number of people receiving Services
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind the people receiving
 
02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
Services may be partial so somebody
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
might require three and maybe they're
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
getting one out of three so keeping that
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and then the Orange is not receiving
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
services at all we included the numbers
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
of people that were projected to start
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
for that entire pie chart as well as the
 
02:25:11.929 --> 02:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
top delay reasons and this is again for
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year all right so so I'll
 
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'll thank you for this I I won't put
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
myself in a position to critique whether
 
02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
or not this is the right uh visual way
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
of laying this out I think as you play
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
with it more you'll get used to it and
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll have some ideas on the way
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
you may want to enhance it or change it
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit I I would just throw my
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
caution in there though that don't over
 
02:25:40.849 --> 02:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
respond to what I'm saying I mean
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's a value-added trade-off if you
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
find yourself spending too much time
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
chasing a pretty picture or a graphic
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
and and not enough time getting care to
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
patients then then we're doing it wrong
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
so I I do like the communication to the
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
public so thank you for that and if we
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
could just make that part of the
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
quarterly report Mr chair would that be
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
a bit possible that would be possible
 
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
do you all have an issue with making the
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
this nice graphic uh part of the
 
02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
quarterly report yes certainly we can
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
yes all right thank you and and I do
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you this is this is nice this
 
02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:26.110 align:start position:0%
thank you this is this is nice this
feels

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
feels
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually kind of nice to be able to
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
make an observation and say something
 
02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
and actually seeing something happen so
 
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
in under a minute so thank you yes
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
so I look forward to your sending me
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
that again and if I can add business
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
cards from both of you and thank you so
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
much our next meeting
 
02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:48.410 align:start position:0%
much our next meeting
okay

02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
one question uh specific to this and I'm
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
going back on a long time being involved
 
02:26:59.090 --> 02:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
with this uh the expression of the DD
 
02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
waitlist was uh always based on funding
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
only and not access to Services now
 
02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
looking at this as representative
 
02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards is speaking with as well is to
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
make this part of the program is uh IEPs
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
versus ISP services and the values
 
02:27:21.050 --> 02:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
they're from
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
would always still remain as part of the
 
02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
the wait list which is the funding
 
02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
criteria there wouldn't be a quite a
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
waiting for dollars but it's these like
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have three criteria vendor family or
 
02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
recruitment uh in here is those uh
 
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
individual costs of would be specific
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh to still meeting the funding would
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
still be there it's just the physical
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
delivery of the said service not being
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
there correct so I just want to make
 
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not going to go back in
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
time and always have a funding debate
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then it's a value judgment year fund
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
buying trees or funding human human
 
02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
beings needs right I would say be even
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
more intentional perhaps in contrasting
 
02:28:07.010 --> 02:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
those two things this statistic is
 
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
because of lack of funding this
 
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
statistic is because we've got the
 
02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
funding but we can't find the troops
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
that make it even more explicit would be
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
my suggestion just that's I was just
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to assure representative McMahon
 
02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:22.429 align:start position:0%
going to assure representative McMahon
that

02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I I in no way want to lose sight of
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
Our obligation to properly fund this I
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at words and and
 
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
precision of what they mean and and when
 
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
I hear wait list I'm I'm thinking you
 
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
know patients standing out in line
 
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
somewhere not being seen not whether or
 
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
not we've done our job to fund it that's
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I and I don't know if we have to
 
02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.929 align:start position:0%
and I and I don't know if we have to
like

02:28:47.929 --> 02:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
tweak along or ignore a law to to get
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
the terminology a little crisper well if
 
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
I may offer I know your point your point
 
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
is well taken which is why I wanted to
 
02:28:59.210 --> 02:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
have from the authorities having
 
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction right here their guidance
 
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
as well is it has was always uh let me
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
say always the with the precursor of
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
today was always uh a funding issue not
 
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
an accessibility of service issue uh
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
that that being moot right now based on

02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee then we're going to know we're
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
