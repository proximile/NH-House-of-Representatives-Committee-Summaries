Bill 28 and naming the courtroom after
 
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
Bill 28 and naming the courtroom after
judge

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
Kelly uh I served under him as a circuit
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
court judge for many years but even
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
before I was a judge he was the
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the court and I
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
saw the court Evol evolve over many
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
years when I first started practicing
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
law the uh the circuit court and
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
particularly the district court was uh
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh at at best uh disheveled it was uh
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
basically made up of part-time judges
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
all over the state and if you were a
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney it depended on what
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
court you went to what judge you saw in
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
order the type of law you were going to
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
type of judgment law you were going to
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
receive and when judge Kelly was
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
appointed the administrative judge uh he
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
did a number of things he standardized
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
practices uh he made it so that we had
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh full-time judges judges who wanted to
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
be judges uh who weren't doing that just
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
to build their resume but because they
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it as a
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
career uh and that was a huge
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh uh Senator G has also
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of the other things that
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
he done um such as adopting the family
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
court where we actually had family court
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
judges who wanted to do family court
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
cases uh which was a change uh he also
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh prospered the court in the sense that
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
he saw that we had new courtrooms uh and
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
new cour houses built across the state
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
and we weren't having uh our courts held
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
in places like in Franklin where you did
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
it in the old opera house on the
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
theater the uh he um he's done a great
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
deal to prosper the court uh and
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
probably the one of the most important
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
things he did was uh among the last
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
things he did and that was to deal bring
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
it bring the court into uh the 21st
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
century electronically so that people
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
could electronically file and people did
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
not have to uh go through the
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
the formal process of appearing for
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
everything that needs to be done and in
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
short I I can't think of anyone who is
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
more worthy of having a courtroom named
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
after him frankly in my personal opinion
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
I think the court house in Plymouth
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
ought to be named after him uh but uh
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
naming a courtroom uh certainly would be
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
an honor and I certainly would encourage
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
Gordon see n thank
 
00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.590 align:start position:0%
Gordon see n thank
you

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
when okay whenever you're ready good
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
morning uh Mr chairman and members of
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you for allowing
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
me to speak here today in support of
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
28 uh naming the primary courtroom of
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
the Plymouth Circuit Courthouse
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
commemorate the remarkable career of The
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
Honorable Edwin w
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
Kelly I've had the distinct honor of
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
serving as a judge in the district and
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
now circuit court for over 32 years and
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
most of that time for over two decades I
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
sat in the very Courthouse that is
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
subject to this
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
bill this afforded me not only an
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work closely with judge
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
Kelly but also to observe him as he
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
carried out many of his other duties uh
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
as administrative judge
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support this bill for the
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
simple reason that judge Kelly has
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
earned this recognition based on his
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
contributions uh to the people of New
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as the first administrative
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
judge of what was the district and
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
municipal court and is now the Circuit
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
Court over the two and a half decades
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
that judge Kelly served in that role he
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
defined the position as he guided the
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
court into the modern
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
era my humble opinion as New Hampshire's
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
first administrative judge of the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Edwin W Kelly did more to
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
provide fair and efficient access to
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
justice for the citizens of New
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than any other individual who
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
has ever served in the judicial
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
system given my limited time here today
 
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh able to specifically
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
enumerate the long list of major
 
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
enumerate the long list of major
accomplishments

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh that judge Kelly was able to uh
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
achieve during his tenure but let me
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
summarize by saying that through his
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
steadfast commitment to the people of
 
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.030 align:start position:0%
steadfast commitment to the people of
New

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he made the court more
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
efficient saving the citizens of New
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire literally hundreds of
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars each year through
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
his tireless efforts and eloquent
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
advocacy he created consistent processes
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
and procedures that gave a void
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
to many who had no prior voice in the
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
system such as victims of domestic
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
violence and child
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
abuse through his effective leadership
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
he modernized the court system and
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
helped motivate others to create a
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%

honor of Judge Kelly but naming the
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
the first judge in that
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%

Plymouth Court when Kasa first started
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%

and then she came back up here
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
throughout her career she's been
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated to Municipal and County
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
government I got to know Jesse during
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
her 11-year tenure at new as New
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
London's Town manager when I was also on
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board and anybody who has
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
been on a planning board or in local
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
government knows that there can be many
 
00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.310 align:start position:0%
government knows that there can be many
challenges

00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
and um among those challenges was uh how
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
to resolve a traffic issue at the
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
intersection of County Road and Newport
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
Road um at the time that she suggested
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
putting a roundabout there it was a very
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
controversial um issue roundabouts
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
really weren't uh well thought of across
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
the board as opposed to traffic lights
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
or just sitting at a stop sign
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
but her um recommendation was Innovative
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
and bold for the time and she uh saw the
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
future and she worked very hard to bring
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
it to fruition in the town of New London
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I think um even though for those
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
people that live in more urban areas um
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the backups might be uh not so much for
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
us it was a great uh a a great thing so
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
we appreciated her efforts
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
um after New London she was assistant
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
Town manager in Hanover she was the town
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
manager in uh Bedford and she ultimately
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
served as the Sullivan County manager
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
she had to retire early um after about a
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
year when she was diagnosed with ALS at
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
age 45 which was tragic needless to say
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
during her Stellar career she was
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
the year in 2016 she was a Lo uh leader
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
amri the city of Cl I also have honor
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
again this term to serve as chair of Sol
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
County delegation my fth consecutive ter
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
I rise in strong support of this
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to Senate Bill 28 to name a
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
roundout in London in honor of Jessie
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
and although the roundabout is not in
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
Sol County all down the road I think
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate honor uh for Jesse
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
because I worked with her in some of my
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
previous terms as delegation
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
chair's very Innovative she helped the
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
acquire more
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
land where a lot of our County Land is
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
and as a result of those efforts we
 
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.669 align:start position:0%
and as a result of those efforts we
turned

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
a was you know no other
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
count I found it to be very entic
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative and up to the challenges of
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
trying to manage in small rural C All
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
County and I want to say in conclusion
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
that when time done she had to leave
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
early because ofing help did an
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
excellent job transitioning for present
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
D signed the letter and I was presting

New London so well I couldn't agree more

with all of the comments uh previous to
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
mine about Jesse LaVine um the town of
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
New London enthusiastically supports
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
this bill to name the New London
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
roundabout the Jesse LaVine roundabout
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
this will make official what has been
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
the common understanding of New London
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
New londoners since even before the
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
roundabout was open
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
Town's people have referred to it as the
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
Jesse LaVine roundabout because of her
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
dogged support of the project and her
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
belief not held by all that the
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
roundabout would increase the safety of
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
citizens traveling on Newport and County
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Roads Town's people saw Jesse as a
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
leader of what was at first a very
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
controversial project many had never
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
heard about roundabouts and many feared
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
chaos in Mayhem would result if it was
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
ever built Jesse addressed all of these
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
concerns with patience in Good Humor
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
until there was enough support to get
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
funding for the project now more than 10
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
years after the roundabout opened even
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
the detractors admit that the roundabout
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
is a big success this is thanks to the
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
efforts of many but in particular Jesse
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
LaVine who just wouldn't give up on
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
getting something that was virtually
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
unheard of at the time built in New
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
London we can't think of a better way to
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%

police force uh they are probably the
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
best trained in the country um and what
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
this bill will do is like I said it will
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
honor the troops but also what it does
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
is stream it's going to streamline the
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
process that allows the memorial
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee to disperse the private funds
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
without having to continuously go to the
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
counsel um what what happens right now
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
is because um because many of the the
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
memorial uh the memorial is going to
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
have a number of contractors so rather
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
than having to have each piece that each
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
contractor is working on to go to the
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
executive Council um it will allow the
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
contract it's a very
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
process and where the executive councel
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
and um meet only once a month it will
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
streamline the process of trying to get
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
the memorial going so with that I'll end
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%

Transportation um a few years I think it
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
was last year extended the time out two
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
to three years before um they could uh
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
finish it and it was planned um planned
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
to be done in I think two years now it's
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
um Extended out two or three or uh three
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
years and the town the dot has brought
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
it back um within I think six months but
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
this is basically a project that London
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
Dairy and dairy have been looking
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
forward to uh getting completed quickly
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
and on time because they have they have
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of economic development that is
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
planning that they had been planning on
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
um they can't afford the time that um
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
the do has um Extended it out um and I
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
know that this is unusual the 10-year
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
plan will um will be dealing with it but
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
I also feel that we need to let uh do
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
know how much it means to London Dairy
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
and dairy to get this job done on time
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
as promised and um maybe not necessarily
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
on budget we're hoping that there is
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
money from the Feds that will come in to
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
help um speed this along and with that
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions from members
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
I have one Senator and it may
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
be deferred to uh Mr Cass when when he
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
testifies but I was just looking at the
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
the current 10year plan where it talks
 
01:17:40.679 --> 01:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
the current 10year plan where it talks
about

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
construction um being
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
done um 21 22 23 finish
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
up4 is this the delay that you're
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
talking about no I believe that last
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
summer they came out with a delay out to
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
24 but uh again um Deputy Commissioner
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
Cass can better Define that but um we
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
wanted it done to the 10-year plan uh
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
plan and uh they extended it out because
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the cost um because of the delays I
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
think the cost had gone up $30
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
million and so they had to push that
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
out thank
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
do welcome back to the committee
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
yes good morning thank you um can
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me all right I just want
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
to connection is there
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
good um yeah thank you for um letting me
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh testify to the bill I just want to
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
um make sure I clarify things so that
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
everything is clear I can offer a little
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
bit more detail from what um Senator
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
birdell had um had presented in terms of
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll do it very quickly so some
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the history of the project um so I
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
think um from what I understand and from
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony and and discussion with
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
with the Senate that the legislative
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
intent is clear some of the language in
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
in in the bill if it is strictly
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted may
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
be um a a a little concerning but um so
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
the the bill is described as the design
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
build exit for a project um to complete
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
the design build project named Derry
 
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
London Derry so we had proceeded with
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
this project uh under a design build
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
procurement which um which was all
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
intended to accelerate the delivery of
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
the project last fall when we opened
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
bids for the from the design bid
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
Consultants the bids were uh and and uh
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
as Senator had pointed out more than $30
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
million over our estimate and because of
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
that and and after debriefs with the
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
design build teams and looking at the
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
risk and the things involved um we
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
decided not to award the contract and to
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
take a step back and to proceed with the
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
project under a more conventional design
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
bid build
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
procurement um uh approach because of
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
the risk involved and in particularly
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
what we heard was because of the um
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
right of way Acquisitions that the
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
design build team was um was um asked to
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
deal with and they placed a lot of risk
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
in that um in that area so taking a step
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
back and doing a a conventional design
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
bid build procurement process we had
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
committed uh and we had meetings uh last
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
November uh to brief uh a lot of the
 
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
November uh to brief uh a lot of the
local

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
um um politicians in the towns on on our
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
um accelerated schedule to do a design
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
bid build procurement so um it does
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
compared to the schedule that's in the
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
10-year plan the 10-year plan had
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
construction funds um to build this
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
project between fiscal year or calendar
 
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
year 2021 and
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
2024 with the design bid build
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
procurement we have we recognize
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
certainly the priority of the project
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
and the needs and we have worked to
 
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate that as as quickly as
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
practicable and the schedule we laid out
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
committed to getting out to Construction
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 20122 so we have a
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
design consultant um already in board
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're working through the design and and
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
and things to have a contract ready to
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
bid in uh
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
2022 um but with the RightWay uh
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
procurement um uh uh RightWay
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions that are needed we uh do
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that that delivery schedule is
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to extend between 2022 to
 
01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
2026 so potentially two more two years
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
longer than the schedule that's in the
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
10-year plan however we have noted that
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
there will be a opportunity there will
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
be a partial opening of the exit to
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
public use when you get to to um
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
essentially Route 28 if you're familiar
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the um layout and you know we
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate that probably sometime in
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
2025 so we may lose a year from what the
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
um uh original 10e plan schedule was
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
planned for
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
um um but um certainly not as but but I
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
think we will be having it open to
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
public use prior to the full build full
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
full fully Full Construction completion
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the schedule and the
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
details and I believe like when we when
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
when when we talked about um talked
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
about it with with the Senate that the
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was you know holding
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
our feet to the fire making sure that we
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
understood that it was a priority to the
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
towns of Derry and London Derry and
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
delivering the project as as soon as
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
possible and as close to the original
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
10year plan schedule at as possible so I
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
think the legislative intent is there
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
the the the specific language in the in
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
the 10year plan from from the schedules
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
and stuff that we've laid out is a
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
little challenging in in in that regard
 
01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
so um I guess I would just leave it at
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
that and uh uh can answer any any
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions but we I just would close by
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
saying and we have assured the the the
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
towns and Senator bdel that we recognize
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
it is a priority and we are fully
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
committed to Prosecuting uh the design
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
and construction as expediently as
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
pass my question is
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
the overrun of $30
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
million and then taking it back to some
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
internally and reworking that do you do
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
you anticipate and being out one more
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
year for the release of that bid that
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
you'll still be in that range or or do
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
you is the department hoping that that
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
number that 30 million would be a lesser
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
number we are um I wouldn't even say
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
hoping I would I challenge to say
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
confident but we are we are pretty
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
certain that that through a a
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
conventional design bid build we can
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
design out some of the risk that was
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
reflected in that design bid build price
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
so they were giving us a a a
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
construction price bidding it on 30%
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
level plans and there was you know
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in that that I think was
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
reflected in the price so I am
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
relatively confident maybe that's the
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
best way to put it that we can design
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
out uh some of that cost increase
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
whether it will be um you know fully
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
what our estimate is or somewhere in in
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
between there I do not believe it will
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
be $30 million more than our present
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
estimate it may be a little bit more
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
there is going to be inflation there are
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to be details that we work out but
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
um we you know and that was part of our
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
decision to design to go with the design
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
bid build that we could not justify at
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
that time that cost increase and I
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
believe that we will deliver it for
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
um uh for Less thank you assistant
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Cass I just want to be clear does
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
the department may I ask have a position
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
B uh not not not particularly no other
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
than I just other than I just wanted to
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
point point out what what we see is is
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
kind of some some confli conflicts with
 
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
the with the specific
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
language um from from what I understand
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
the intent to
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
be follow if this bill passes as
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
written what's going to happen what what
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
is wrong I mean and will you need 30
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
million more dollars complete the
 
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
million more dollars complete the
project

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes exactly as written I
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that the time
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
frame of the 10-year plan at this at
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
this point can cannot be met um I think
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
like I said we will get it started as
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
soon as possible we will get it started
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
and it will be under construction um we
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
will have a contract out next
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
spring um but we are not going to be
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
able to complete it in the
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
um by the 2024 time frame that's in the
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
present 10-year plan
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you Mr CH thank
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
you Thompson um Deputy Commissioner what
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
was the uh what was the original
 
01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
this round round numbers it might have
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
been 59 something but um from a from a
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking construction cost as as
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
well now so not including the right of
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
way and the engineering that needs to be
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
done but from a construction cost our
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
estimate was um right around $60 million
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what's reflected in the in
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
the in the 10-year
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
plan and who was the contractor that
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
Pa um who was the contractor that came
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
back with the 30 million over
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
well there were three proposals um since
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't award the contract um it it it
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
we we can't really talk about the the
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the details of the RFP procurement
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we didn't proceed with with the
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
with the contracts so but the um you
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
know apparent low bid of of that was
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
more than $30 million over our our
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Deputy
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for coming today um so I
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
understand uh that it's recognized that
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's unusual to introduce a bill like
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
this out of cycle with the 10-year plan
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
um I understand your testimony that
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if this is passed as
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
is you can't achieve it in the time
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
frame so
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
what if we amended it so it was a
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
realistic time frame what would I mean
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
is there any reason you can see why we
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't handle this during the regular
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
term no
 
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.950 align:start position:0%
term no
no

01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead um I was just
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
wondering is
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
there a downside or an upside I mean I
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
to doing it one way or the other that
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
identify uh this that for me yeah um no
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
I mean I I recognize I I certainly
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
recognize um the community's
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
um not even desire but the but but but
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
the the community desire to send a
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
strong me
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
message um I can I I can tell you and I
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
can tell you know senator bir all and I
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
did during the Senate transportation
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
that that message has has been received
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we are committed to to um you know
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
delivering this project as as quickly as
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
we can and I believe that the schedule
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we have laid out um has been
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
recognized and generally accepted and
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
that you know the the the folks want to
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
see us make sure make sure that that
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we you know hold to that schedule
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
and do everything we can to to meet that
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
schedule I believe that's what the
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is here so if if if
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill you know is is
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
is um changed along along those lines
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
that I mean that that's that's that's
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
fine it's it's your prerogative to to
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
send that policy um direction to the
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
department um and and uh we will do our
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
best to to meet it so um
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
but I guess my point is uh with or
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
without this this this piece of
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislation the the the we we're fully
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
aware of of that message and fully
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
committed to um delivering this project
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
as exped as expeditiously as possible
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative AB yes
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Deputy Commissioner what what
 
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Deputy Commissioner what what
I'm

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
um what I'm hearing is that this U
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
achieve based on the cost and the the
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
bidding process going forward and maybe
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea as
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
has said to include this because what
 
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying from a time frame is that
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's not going to be even bitable
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
till next
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
spring so to and that's one of the major
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
tasks that we have for
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh the next session is to uh or the
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
session beginning January is to come up
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year plan so wouldn't it
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
make more sense to just include it with
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
that rather than to pass a piece of
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
unachievable I I I yes yes I would say
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
so the the one thing I think about this
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is is to send that strong
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
message about the the prioritization of
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
of of the project and and and to that
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
degree like I said I think the
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
legislative intent behind it from the
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
discussions and stuff um is is is is
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
good and we're honoring honoring that I
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
just had wanted to point out that that
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
that the you know a technical direct
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation of of the way the bill is
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
written is problematic at this point uh
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
project representative Ed
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and thank you
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
Deputy Cass for taking this question I
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
have the way the poos bill is written
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
again it talks about design build um I
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
take it from what you were saying is it
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're switching over to the
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
design in it and then constructing it if
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
is the way the bill is written right now
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
with change the way you're intending to
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
do it and wouldn't that would that cost
 
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.750 align:start position:0%
do it and wouldn't that would that cost
more

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it I think it depends on how
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's interpreted
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
um the way it is referenced as the
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
design build project named uh Derry
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
London Derry it doesn't necessarily
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
specific uh
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
specifically um require the design build
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
per procurement but um it could be
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
interpreted that way based on the the
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
the description in other words is
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
is I mean colloquially it's I think that
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
is how it was referred to because it was
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
being developed as a design build
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
procurement so I think that's where the
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
reference of the design build project
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
named Derry London Derry but it
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh and I think that's what I was
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
trying to point out some of the maybe
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in the bill language
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
that that um in a strict reading of the
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the exact language
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um my question
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be about what might happen to the
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
10-year plan if we get a a big increase
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
in federal funding um is it just
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
accelerate everything up or are we going
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be picking projects out to to move up
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
the schedule based upon their they're
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
being ready to go and is that going
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
project I don't think it will affect
 
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
this project um I know even at the
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
governor and Council um we've had some
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
discussions um it came up from Council
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
gatas relative to um you know potential
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
earmark funding and thing things like
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
that and and um while additional funding
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
would certainly be welcome it is it is
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
not as important
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
in uh delivering this project at this
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
point as completing the design in the
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
right of way um process so it's not a
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
funding constraint that is dictating the
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
schedule that is part of the critical
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
path here um so I guess that's the
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
answer to your question and with regard
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
to the 10year plan um there is well I
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
hope we know more when we start those
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
discussions you know this this summer
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
about where things are in Washington and
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding and stuff like that
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
because there's been a lot of discussion
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
but uh not a lot of details to
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
question see none thank
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
you good thank
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
you and uh there's Mr David uh Karen the

time administrator
bring

01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
up hi can you hear me yeah welcome
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways yeah I'm sorry
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
my uh my feed just cut off and rejoined
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity just to
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
add some additional comments uh that
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
Senator blazes Dell presented in bill
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
cast as well uh just for your
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
information this project has been a
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
transportation priority for towns of
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
Daring londondary for decades uh it was
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
in the uh Federal record of decision
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
there were two goals for this project
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
one is to uh promote economic
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
development for both communities and
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
also to relieve congestion on Route 102
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
which is uh East and West Broadway here
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
in D which is our main
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
throughfare uh and uh again not to
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
repeat what uh what bill was speaking
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
about but you know unlike any other
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
project in New Hampshire that has a
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
regional transportation challenge uh the
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy and Londoner have each
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
committed $5 million in local dollars to
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
this project uh we've gone from the
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
conceptual stage from over three decades
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
ago to nearing construction and uh our
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
our concerns are a couple uh uh one is
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we think it'd be critically
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
important to have the legislative intent
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
that this project move forward to
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
completion as soon as possible uh the
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
towns recognize and agree with Bill's
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
position that final construction will
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
not be completed until
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
2026 that's just the position we find
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves in after the uh designed Bill
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
process was completed with the
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate cost
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
overun uh so our recommendation is that
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee amend the complt comption
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
date to
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
2026 uh that would send a message to the
 
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
next year's 10-year Highway
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation process that this H
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
project remains a priority of the
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislature in the communities and uh my
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
last comment is is that bill correct me
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I think actually the
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
construction project is now viewed as
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
being in three phases uh the first phase
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
will probably be most visible to uh the
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
traveling public with a connection with
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
i93 the second and third phases include
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh construction and segments into uh
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
local roads in Dairy which will be part
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
of the 4A Corridor and our concern is
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
that without legislative backing uh I'm
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
concerned if there are additional cost
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
overruns uh the third phase may be in
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy and if that occurs in a third L
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
third phase is either not constructed or
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
delayed that would simply uh transfer a
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
current congested traffic situation in
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
downtown to a separate part of dairy so
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
again in closing I thank you for your
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
time and I think it'd be incredibly
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have a legislature go on
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
record as having this project as a state
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation priority and to be
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
completed by 2026 thank you for your
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
time thank you are there any questions
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
mrar from members of the
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
of people wishing to testify that I have
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
um nobody else
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
under um the attendees have raise their
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
hand to
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
testify um I with that I will close the
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:49.870 align:start position:0%
 
bill6

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
and just want to say a couple things
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
with this is with any other bill that we
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
have in front of us um we have four
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
choices we can pass the bill as is we
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
can find the bill inexpedient to
 
01:42:08.109 --> 01:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
legislate we can amend the bill as
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
suggested by Mr
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
Karen or we can retain the bill and make
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
sure it gets put into the 10year plan a
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
year from now
 
01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.669 align:start position:0%
year from now
correct

01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
um if we were to go with the amended uh
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
option um we're not going to get that
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
done today obviously um just for the
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
committee's um information I have
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled um the 19th of May for any
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
executive sessions that we don't get
 
01:42:40.119 --> 01:42:41.550 align:start position:0%
executive sessions that we don't get
finished

01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
finished
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
today so that said before we opened up
 
01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
today so that said before we opened up
for

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
motion um does any of the committee
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
have um something they would like to say
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
Newton yes uh it seems like there's a
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions with this bill uh and
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
the biggest one concern of mine is how
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
paid and I think that uh referring it to
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
interim study or or retaining it would
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
be the wise choice to do because it
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
keeps the pressure on the
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
do and we would have plenty of time uh
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
to make a decision to add it to the
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
10-year plan or do some other
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
alternative action for the second half
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
of our session so I would certainly
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
support uh a motion in that aspect and I
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
think it would be uh prudent to move in
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:47.070 align:start position:0%
think it would be uh prudent to move in
that

01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
direction thank you representative
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
eil thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be highly unusual
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
for our committee to recommend ought to
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
pass on um on a bill such as this which
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
is out of cycle with the 10-year plan
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
our tradition um at least in my
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
experience has always been to retain um
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
a bill such as this I find a challenging
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill um especially in its
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
current uh the way it's current set up
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we're I I wouldn't want to pass a
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
bill that's impossible to achieve just
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
to indicate legislative intent um we
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
have the hearing um record from the
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
Senate we have the hearing record today
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
the gaset process will also give these
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
towns an ample opportunity to represent
 
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
their interests this is of such vital
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
importance it's hard for me me to
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
believe that it wouldn't uh ultimately
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
make it into the draft 10-year plan
 
01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's presented to us and for all those
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
reasons I would have a hard time
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
supporting anything but a motion to
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion before I see
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee represent I'll be I I move to
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
retain uh Senate Bill
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
116 second second approv by
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative fluier seconded by
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative mononi that the committee
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
retains Senate Bill
 
01:45:43.119 --> 01:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
retains Senate Bill
116

01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
116
 
01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
Andes recognized to speak on this motion
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
I I agree wholeheartedly with
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative eel on the reasons for
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
retaining bill I think this is a
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
worthwhile project but I'm concerned I
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
would not want to pass the bill as
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
written definitely and the more I have
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
some questions and I think if we retain
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
it we have according to the house cter
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
we have until November 18th you know we
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
thought to such important we could pass
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
it then and hopefully we're going to
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
have a clearer picture of how much
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
Federal money hopefully we're going to
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
get from the infrastructure which I I
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
think is going to pass sometime this
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
summer or certainly early fall and I
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
think it's going to it may not be what
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
the president exactly want it but I
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be for real roads
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
Bridges Etc that's my hope but I think
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
we need to wait on this but I think our
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
intent is this is an important project
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I expect in the end I'm going to vote
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
for tent that has this project and gets
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
it done as soon as possible I but I
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
think we need to retain it to make sure
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
there's pressure on the do like the
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned to do this
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
complet m thank you Mr chairman I agree
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
with my fellow members but I just like
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
to say I understand the angs here with
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
the DAR and lond how long projects take
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
but I want to I want to commend the
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
department here on pulling back and
 
01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:07.639 align:start position:0%
looking at an alternative way to get
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
this project done in Theo
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
B It's My Hope between that keeping this
 
01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:14.669 align:start position:0%

this bill out we will have a fairly
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
clear picture of what will be in the
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan the gas hearings will be
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
essentially completed and we
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
can if we're not happy with what's in
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
there that we can fix this bill and vote
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%

03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
time and I also want to make sure
 
03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.870 --> 03:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
it looks like everybody's here or many

are going to be back um the time being
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
115 by my watch um which is the only one

that matters
 
03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
um I will call the hearing on um Senate

and uh
 
03:14:59.790 --> 03:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
members uh of the
 
03:15:02.110 --> 03:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
committee about two years ago I was
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
asked by the haal board of Selectmen
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's one of the towns in the 27 Town
 
03:15:08.429 --> 03:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
District that I represent to chair a
 
03:15:10.349 --> 03:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
meeting between the board and the
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire Precinct
 
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners this meeting was intended
 
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
to explore changing the state mandated
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
form formula that dictates the raising
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
and appropriation of haal tax dollars
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the transfer of those dollars to the
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire precinct for maintenance
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the precinct's
 
03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
roads but the discussion ended when the
 
03:15:34.030 --> 03:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the precinct basically
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
pointed to the state law and refused to
 
03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
discuss any meaningful change to the
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
formula it is that law that section one
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
of this legislation seeks to
 
03:15:47.269 --> 03:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
change current state law dictates a
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
formula that requires haval taxpayers to
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
raise and appropriate funds for the
 
03:15:53.550 --> 03:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
highway department of the Woodsville
 
03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:54.429 align:start position:0%
highway department of the Woodsville
fire

03:15:54.429 --> 03:15:54.439 align:start position:0%
fire
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
Precinct it requires havil to pay the
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
fire Precinct over $50,000 a mile
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
roughly five times the $9,500 per mile
 
03:16:06.269 --> 03:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
that it costs havil to maintain its own
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
roads consider that this state law
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
requires one political subdivision to
 
03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
fund the highway department of another
 
03:16:15.389 --> 03:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
that's no different than your town being
 
03:16:17.910 --> 03:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
told by state government and state law
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that it has to fund the highway
 
03:16:20.830 --> 03:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
department of one of your adjoining
 
03:16:23.469 --> 03:16:23.479 align:start position:0%
towns it is an egregious violation of
 
03:16:26.429 --> 03:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
every tenant of local
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
control opponents of this legislation
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
will cleverly ask you to kill it in the
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
interest of maintaining local control
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
knowing the respect we and the
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislature hold to this fundamental
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
Prem premise of New Hampshire governance
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
the law we asking you to amend today
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
mandates that the taxpayers of one
 
03:16:45.070 --> 03:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
political subdivision hail raise in
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate local funds to pay for the
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
in expenses of another political
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision the Woodsville fire Precinct
 
03:16:53.429 --> 03:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
making matters even worse the state law
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
requires approval of any changes to the
 
03:16:57.870 --> 03:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
current Financial arrangement to gain
 
03:17:00.389 --> 03:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
the approval of the legislature and the
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
governor honorable members of the
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee this is not local
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
control rather this law preempts local
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
control and eliminates any semblance of
 
03:17:11.229 --> 03:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
good faith negotiations as demonstrated
 
03:17:13.389 --> 03:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
by the ongoing refusal of the precinct
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
to make any substantial changes to the
 
03:17:18.030 --> 03:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
grossly lopsided State man mated funding
 
03:17:20.189 --> 03:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
formula without passage of this
 
03:17:23.349 --> 03:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
legislation local control does not exist
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
because state law
 
03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
governs this
 
03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
situation woodville's hired lobbyist at
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
a cost to Woodsville taxpayers of almost
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
$10,000 so far asks for time to allow
 
03:17:39.670 --> 03:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
the parties to resolve their differences
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
but those differences will never be
 
03:17:43.189 --> 03:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
resolved so long as this law protects
 
03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
the state-mandated gravy train for
 
03:17:47.229 --> 03:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
Woodsville which disenfranchise IES the
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
citizens of hail from voting on the
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
funds they're required by state law to
 
03:17:53.070 --> 03:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
raise and appropriate every year for the
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
different political
 
03:17:57.630 --> 03:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
subdivision I ask you is this a law that
 
03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
you would support if your town was the
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
donor Town funding another towns Highway
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
Department sadly this issue has fostered
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
deep division within the community
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
failure to amend the statute will
 
03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
perpetuate that division for the
 
03:18:12.550 --> 03:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future and the state's
 
03:18:14.110 --> 03:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
continued interference in this local
 
03:18:15.630 --> 03:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
budget issue will continue to prevent
 
03:18:18.030 --> 03:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
its resolution at the local level for as
 
03:18:20.349 --> 03:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
long as it remains in
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
place section two of the bill was
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
requested by the Department of Revenue
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
Administration in response to the
 
03:18:27.950 --> 03:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire precinct's refusal year
 
03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
after year to perform the annual audit
 
03:18:31.469 --> 03:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
required of every political subdivision
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
in the state despite dozens of emails
 
03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
phone messages and conversations asking
 
03:18:38.429 --> 03:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners to comply with the law
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
the department will speak to this
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
section in subsequent
 
03:18:44.189 --> 03:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and finally as an adjunct to
 
03:18:46.389 --> 03:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
this bill it's instructive to note that
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general recently found the
 
03:18:49.710 --> 03:18:49.720 align:start position:0%

warrant that's electioneering plain and
 
03:19:07.710 --> 03:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
simple the Attorney General is also
 
03:19:09.309 --> 03:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
investigating additional election law
 
03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:12.199 align:start position:0%

03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
identified although not yet complete
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
several violations of both the municipal
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%

have asked to
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
testify um I would ask everybody whether
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're in support or opposition to the
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
bill to be
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
concise and if somebody has already said
 
03:20:53.469 --> 03:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
what you were planning on saying not
 
03:20:57.309 --> 03:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
repeat that um it is difficult enough
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
for all of the
 
03:21:03.030 --> 03:21:03.040 align:start position:0%

03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
of us with all of the uh people who are
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
justifying to keep track and it would
 
03:21:13.510 --> 03:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
just make things go a little smoother so
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we can make a a logical
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
decision um second up I would like to
 
03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
decision um second up I would like to
call

03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
from here thank you um and if you
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
everybody could identify themselves and
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
who they represent if they represent
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
anyone my name is Stephen Robbins and I
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
live in Woodsville I've lived in
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville um since I was three years
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
old in
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
1969 um and I do not support this bill
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that we have some
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
issues within our town that um need to
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
be dealt with locally not dealt with the
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
your level and
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that this bill
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
and um Senate of GAA have worked very
 
03:22:14.910 --> 03:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
hard to divide our
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
community and the only way that we're
 
03:22:19.389 --> 03:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
going to correct this is to bring the
 
03:22:19.399 --> 03:22:20.590 align:start position:0%
going to correct this is to bring the
parties

03:22:20.590 --> 03:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
parties
 
03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
together that this
 
03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
affects and let us decide how to fix our
 
03:22:31.269 --> 03:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:31.279 --> 03:22:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the the Woodsville
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer will be double taxed
 
03:22:46.469 --> 03:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
by by implementing this this bill um and
 
03:22:48.030 --> 03:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's fair to to
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
those of us that that live in the
 
03:22:53.150 --> 03:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
Woodsville District of the town of havil
 
03:22:56.349 --> 03:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
um again this whole the initial system
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
was built and designed so that so
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we were not double taxed and by you
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
approving this bill and moving it
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%

03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information pertaining to
 
03:24:16.349 --> 03:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
senville 26 relative to the roads of the
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
W fire district Senate Bill 26 as
 
03:24:20.910 --> 03:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
amended in the Senate grants the
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district the option of
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
operating its own Highway Department in
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
maintaining its eight miles of roads at
 
03:24:29.710 --> 03:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
The District's own expense the
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district like other
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
precincts is a separate and distinct
 
03:24:36.910 --> 03:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
municipality from the town the entire
 
03:24:38.670 --> 03:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of forming a Precinct or Village
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
district is to allow a smaller group of
 
03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
residents to manage their own needs by
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
removing some power from the existing
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
municipality in this case the town
 
03:24:49.870 --> 03:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
Woodsville has a separate legislative
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
body and a separate governing body
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
through which it exercises his their
 
03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
power however with that power comes
 
03:25:01.150 --> 03:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility specifically precincts
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
are responsible for funding their own
 
03:25:05.070 --> 03:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
activities Woodsville has the authority
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
to raise and appropriate its own funds
 
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
from its own residents Woodsville is
 
03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
free to raise appropriate and expend as
 
03:25:15.630 --> 03:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
much or as little money as its voters
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
and governing body feel is appropriate
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
the town has no control over that the
 
03:25:23.790 --> 03:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district should not have
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
its cake and eat it too the Woodsville
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
because Woodsville wants the independent
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
power to operate its own Highway
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
Department without accountability to the
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
town voters yet it wants the town
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the majority of whom do not
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
live in Woodsville to fund it even
 
03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
though the town's Highway Department is
 
03:25:43.870 --> 03:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
equipped with a cap incapable of
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining the precinct's 8 miles of
 
03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
maintaining the precinct's 8 miles of
Road

03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
Road
 
03:25:50.189 --> 03:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
put it simply to put it Simply Having
 
03:25:52.030 --> 03:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
the Town Fund woodville's Highway
 
03:25:53.910 --> 03:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
Department operations places the burden
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
of funding the municipal operation of
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
one municipality Woodsville on the
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of another municipality the
 
03:26:03.429 --> 03:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
town while simultaneously depriving the
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
town Authority and accountability over
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of those funds this is
 
03:26:10.830 --> 03:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
wholly inappropriate and runs a foul of
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
basic principles of Municipal governance
 
03:26:12.960 --> 03:26:14.750 align:start position:0%
basic principles of Municipal governance
and

03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures this is even more
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
Troublesome given the fact that the
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire District's Highway
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
Department only serves the area within
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
its own Precinct boundaries three square
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
miles and provides no benefit to the
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
large the town at large the town of
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
havil should not be required to fund
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
woodville's own internal operations
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
which solely benefit
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
Woodsville I reate due to its importance
 
03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
that the town of havil is willing and
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
able to maintain the roads within the
 
03:26:45.469 --> 03:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district through the
 
03:26:47.469 --> 03:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
town's Highway Department who already
 
03:26:51.309 --> 03:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
maintains 72 miles of Roads the town's
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Highway Department already maintains
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
these roads throughout havil and is
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to take on the eight miles of
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
Roads within the Woodsville fire
 
03:27:01.870 --> 03:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
district the town is ready willing and
 
03:27:03.790 --> 03:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
able to take onroad maintenance for all
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
of its residents including those in
 
03:27:08.429 --> 03:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
Woodsville however so long as Woodsville
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
desires to retain its own independent
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
power to operate a highway department
 
03:27:14.910 --> 03:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
within its borders it should bear the
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fund the same the town
 
03:27:21.070 --> 03:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
of hail asks that you please allow the
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
26 thank you are there any
 
03:27:31.269 --> 03:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
questions of um this Cod Lan from
 
03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
committee raised representative
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
ful yes thank you Mr chairman uh manager
 
03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
cing right now the the
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville District maintains those
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
eight miles of Roads themselves is that
 
03:27:52.510 --> 03:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
correct they do they have their own
 
03:27:54.510 --> 03:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
highway department and they maintain
 
03:27:56.670 --> 03:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
their eight miles of Roads yes right and
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
so and and the money for that comes from
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
the taxes that are raised townwide and
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
the formula gives them roughly 25% based
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
upon assess value is that is that
 
03:28:12.590 --> 03:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
correct um that's part of it yes sorry I
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
should be asking for a
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
follow um
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
so if if this occurs that
 
03:28:25.150 --> 03:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh if we take away that resp
 
03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility you would still be
 
03:28:28.830 --> 03:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
raising funds townwide and then they
 
03:28:30.189 --> 03:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
distributed between the Woodsville
 
03:28:34.510 --> 03:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
district and everybody else according to
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
however the town
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
meeting approved of you know the town
 
03:28:41.469 --> 03:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
budget is that is that what's being
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
proposed here with Senate Bill 26 what
 
03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
it does is it takes away the requirement
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
of the town to fund the Woodsville
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
Highway Department um making Woodsville
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for its own operations that
 
03:28:57.950 --> 03:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
they choose to have um for within their
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
their Precinct and they have full
 
03:29:02.429 --> 03:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
authority over that um and then it
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
leaves it up to the town um at the at
 
03:29:08.830 --> 03:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Town level to decide whether
 
03:29:10.590 --> 03:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
there are services that Woodsville is
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
providing that the town would pay
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
for question still don't getting to the
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
point here that the town if the town
 
03:29:25.510 --> 03:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
raises $100,000 for Highway Maintenance
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
according to the current uh situation
 
03:29:30.510 --> 03:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
they pay a proportional share to
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
Woodsville approximately
 
03:29:35.229 --> 03:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
25% sometimes it's up it's up to almost
 
03:29:38.550 --> 03:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
30% so it it it fluctuates so so that
 
03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
that reflects the amount of money it's
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually raised from that District
 
03:29:42.750 --> 03:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
because it's based
 
03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
upon a proportion of the pro rate share
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
of the assessed value so essentially
 
03:29:50.790 --> 03:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're just giving them back money that's
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
raised from that district for Highway
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
Maintenance so so when you think about
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the two different layers of
 
03:30:01.630 --> 03:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
government so you have the town and then
 
03:30:03.830 --> 03:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
you have the precinct um there are
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
similar activities where the town is
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
providing um for example uh police
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
services to Woodsville so the entire
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
town raises about a million dollars a
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
year to have a police department and to
 
03:30:18.830 --> 03:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
to operate that Police Department
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
however about 70 between 70 and 80% of
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
our police force forces throughout the
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
year and our dollars are spent in the
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Precinct of course when you
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
think about uh Equity um certainly um
 
03:30:36.030 --> 03:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
hail at large is paying the the largest
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
portion of that but the services are
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
being provided in Woodsville so you have
 
03:30:42.550 --> 03:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
to kind of separate the town from the
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
precinct the precinct is a municipal
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
entity it gets to choose um in this case
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
to have a highway department um and and
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
no one else has control over that but
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
the individuals in Woodsville um however
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of the town is responsible for
 
03:30:59.189 --> 03:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
for assisting with paying for
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
that and even though we already operate
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
a highway
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
department and so the the difference is
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay that um the town's Highway
 
03:31:11.550 --> 03:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
Department budget is about 780,000
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
woodville's Department Highway
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
Department budget has gone up to almost
 
03:31:16.710 --> 03:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
half a million
 
03:31:16.720 --> 03:31:17.550 align:start position:0%
half a million
so

03:31:17.550 --> 03:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's for eight miles of Road
 
03:31:22.830 --> 03:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
roads where we have 72 miles of roads
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we cover for 780,000 so even though
 
03:31:29.550 --> 03:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're you're you're
 
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
going Apples to Apples with with giving
 
03:31:34.269 --> 03:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
them back every penny that they raise
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
Equitable and same and it's the same
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
with welfare as well so everyone in town
 
03:31:48.510 --> 03:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
pays the welfare budget um but the same
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
the same um ratio goes to Woodsville
 
03:31:53.309 --> 03:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
most of our welfare dollars are spent in
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
Woodsville but everybody pays for that
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
town thank you Mr chairman and M codling
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
question I have is what percentage of
 
03:32:11.870 --> 03:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
the town's base tax rate is raised from
 
03:32:14.590 --> 03:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
the fire district area isn't that the
 
03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the commercial
 
03:32:20.309 --> 03:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
property in the town of hail yes so
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's about 20% of the tax base in in
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
the Woodsville Precinct because of the
 
03:32:27.070 --> 03:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings the commercial
 
03:32:27.080 --> 03:32:28.990 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings the commercial
Enterprises

03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:29.000 align:start position:0%

budget questions regarding the
 
03:34:53.189 --> 03:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
calculation of the Woodsville Highway
 
03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
funding started to arise during the
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
preparation of the 2018 budget
 
03:35:00.030 --> 03:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
process uh as finance officer I made the
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
decision to move employee health
 
03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits out of the individual
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
Department line items um into one line
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
item as a result of this this reduced
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
the total Highway budget by about
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
10% um and this budget figure is what's
 
03:35:19.229 --> 03:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
used is in part of the Woodsville
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
Highway funding
 
03:35:22.910 --> 03:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
calculation because of this change the
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
precinct Commissioners felt the town was
 
03:35:27.550 --> 03:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
no longer providing them with adequate
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
funding um the town manager that hired
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
me retired in November of 2018 and an
 
03:35:35.950 --> 03:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
inm toown manager came in uh to prepare
 
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
the 2019 budget uh the Woodsville
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners then went to him to
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
express their concerns about the funding
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
of the Woodsville highway department and
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
I was redirected to calc calate the
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
woodwell highway funding to include the
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
health insurance benefits although I
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
disagreed I did recalculate the funding
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
and included the revised figure in the
 
03:35:54.399 --> 03:35:56.070 align:start position:0%
and included the revised figure in the
2019

03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
2019
 
03:35:58.750 --> 03:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
budget um the Woodsville Commissioners
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
still continue to question the highway
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
funding calculation and brought up their
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
concerns with the new town manager who
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
was hired in April of
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
2019 the new town manager requested I
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide her with the information
 
03:36:12.590 --> 03:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the Woodsville Highway funding
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
which I did um I gave her the
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that I used as well as the
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding that was
 
03:36:21.550 --> 03:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
used that the spreadsheet was created
 
03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:22.309 align:start position:0%
used that the spreadsheet was created
based

03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
based
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
on we both her and I reviewed the
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
documentations and agreed that the
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet being used in calculating
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
the highway funding did not accurately
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
cor capture the memorandum of
 
03:36:35.309 --> 03:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
understanding so I was then asked to
 
03:36:37.389 --> 03:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
revise the spreadsheets to more
 
03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect reflect the
 
03:36:42.429 --> 03:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding um after the
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet was revised we would hold a
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
meeting with the selectman and the
 
03:36:47.790 --> 03:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Commissioners to discuss the
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
res visions and work towards reaching an
 
03:36:51.550 --> 03:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
agreement about the funding
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
formula my revisions Were Meant to
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
provide a starting point for the
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and Commissioners to work
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
together to come up with a funding
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
formula which more accurately reflected
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of understanding the
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were unwilling to work
 
03:37:07.389 --> 03:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
with this s board towards a
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
solution in an attempt to reinforce the
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding as law sb75
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
was introduced in 2009 and was passed as
 
03:37:19.389 --> 03:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
amended however the 2009 change to the
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
law is unclear as to what the formula
 
03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
law is unclear as to what the formula
actually

03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
is therefore the town has had to refer
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
back to the 2008 memorandum of
 
03:37:30.750 --> 03:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
understanding for its
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
calculations over the years since the
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
introduction of the memorandum of
 
03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
understanding the town has typically
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
provided the precinct of Woodsville
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
funding that equates to 30 to 50% of
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
what the town budgets for our highway
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
department for example in 2008 18 the
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
town's Highway budget was
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
$769,500 and the town provided the
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.790 --> 03:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
$429,000 in funding for their Highway
 
03:38:01.349 --> 03:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
Department that funding equates to 55.77
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
per of what the town spent on their
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
roads to further put this into
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
perspective the town spent that 796
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
th000 to maintain 72 miles of Road
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
within our jurisdiction while the town
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
provided the precinct of Woodville with
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
$429,000 to care for the their eight
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
miles of
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
Road that's
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
$1,687 being spent per mile by the town
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
in comparison to $
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
53,6 per mile being spent by the
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
precinct in 2020 when the revisions were
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
made to the formula the precinct of
 
03:38:39.429 --> 03:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
Woodsville received about
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
$5,988 from the town which equated to
 
03:38:46.349 --> 03:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
16.68% of the town's Highway
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
budget that reduced their amount spent
 
03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
per mile to
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
$1,497 which is more in lined with what
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
the town spends maintaining our
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
roads to me it seems financially
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
irresponsible for the town to be
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
providing these large sums of money to
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
maintain through their three square
 
03:39:07.710 --> 03:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
miles of Roads located within the 52
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
square miles of the town in addition
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
Woodsville property owners are property
 
03:39:14.750 --> 03:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
owners of the town of hail and therefore
 
03:39:16.349 --> 03:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
just as respons responsible to pay for
 
03:39:18.189 --> 03:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of the town roads as a
 
03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
property owner who say lives in hail
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
Corner the town has its own Highway
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
Department that is completely capable of
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining the roads within the
 
03:39:28.750 --> 03:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the precinct of Woodsville
 
03:39:30.030 --> 03:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
however the precinct of Woodsville made
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the choice many years ago to ask the
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
state for permission to create their own
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
highway department and they were granted
 
03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:35.950 align:start position:0%
highway department and they were granted
that

03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
permission therefore it is the
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the property owners
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
within the precinct of Woodsville to
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
fund their Precinct highway department
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
and this is what sb26 is attempting to
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
do I ask you to please vote for sb26 as
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
amended and give the town back local
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%

my name is Matthew melrick I'm currently
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
the vice chair for the holl select board
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I just want to reiterate a couple of
 
03:42:29.149 --> 03:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
things um that um Senator G had spoken
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
about um we um they talked about local
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
control and we had I was part of that
 
03:42:37.990 --> 03:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
original negotiation uh back about two
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
years ago and I sat we had approximately
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
three maybe more meetings that were
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
kindly chaired by Senator GA and
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rick lad uh themselves
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
they actually came down in N uh to
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to U help these
 
03:42:55.950 --> 03:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh and they were completely
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
fruitless we had we had no no um nothing
 
03:43:03.149 --> 03:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
came of those negotiations at all um
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to say is that this is the
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
antithesis of local control um this
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
Arrangement as it stands now is the only
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
one like it in the entire State of New
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the state basically ties
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
the town's hands and they dictate to us
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
how our locally raised Highway taxes are
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
to be spent
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
um just like I said Woodsville is a
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct municipality and
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
under the laws in New Hampshire they
 
03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to choose what
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
services they wish to provide for their
 
03:43:39.389 --> 03:43:39.399 align:start position:0%
own people so when uh in in part of
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
those negotiations that we had one of
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners had stated well we
 
03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
just want our Highway money back but
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
problem with that thinking is when they
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
want their Highway money back to use on
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
their roads only within their District
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
they're not paying for the other 72
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
miles of road that all the residents of
 
03:44:01.790 --> 03:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the town of hail use um and like
 
03:44:03.670 --> 03:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
manager codling has stated you know
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
almost 80% of our police resources are
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
spent within that municipality there of
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville but yet we don't partition
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
out the police Bill like that you know
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
everybody takes an equal share when you
 
03:44:18.189 --> 03:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
join a town you contribute a little bit
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
and I think you receive a lot in return
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the case here because going
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
forward when you get 28 30% of our road
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
budget that has to be returned to
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
Woodsville what happens is going forward
 
03:44:35.309 --> 03:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
for an INF for eternity every time the
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
town of hail decides they need a plow
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
they need a truck they need a grader
 
03:44:42.149 --> 03:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
they need to 10 you know you have to add
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
30% to that purchase price to hand over
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
over to a municipality it's it's it's
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
really not a fair or Equitable solution
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's heavily weighted it's a
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
lose-lose situation for the town and and
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
we don't begrudge the Woodsville
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
Precinct anything they they have their
 
03:45:01.110 --> 03:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
well within their legal rights to have
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
their own um highway department and you
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
know maintain their roads as they see
 
03:45:09.149 --> 03:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
fit but they have the they have the
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay for it themselves that
 
03:45:14.110 --> 03:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
they they can only provide the services
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that their tax payers are willing to to
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
pay for and that's that's how I see it
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
should work
 
03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
just it's just about fairness and and
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
like I said that's what happens because
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bad precedent to set going
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
forward so you know on a Statewide level
 
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the larger
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
municipality said to the state well we
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
have our own Police Department we don't
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
want to contribute to the state police
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
it would slowly erode and this is this
 
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
is just a law that really
 
03:45:48.269 --> 03:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed and uh I would
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
please uh please please uh ask you to uh
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
vote for s26 as it is amended thank you
 
03:45:57.389 --> 03:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
03:46:01.149 --> 03:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.510 --> 03:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
boy Mr chairman thank you and uh Vice
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
chairman Briel Brook thank you very much
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
for your testimony question I understand
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
from doing my due diligence that last
 
03:46:15.389 --> 03:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
year the town of havil at their annual
 
03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
meeting decided to create their own fire
 
03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
department and that they would be
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
inviting the North havil and havil
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
Corner fired precincts into that um new
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
department that was created is is that
 
03:46:31.070 --> 03:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
still the plan of attack for the town of
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
April oh yes sir our um it I'll give you
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
once over the world on that um the uh it
 
03:46:42.030 --> 03:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
it that plan initiated when um the ha
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
Corner people came to us with the idea
 
03:46:47.070 --> 03:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
of maybe becoming part of the town and
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
forming a single department so we put it
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
a at a vote to the town's people at town
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
meeting it was approved we had to
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
obviously get the town to sign off on it
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
first and and the bill as P the um
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
Warren article as past stated that there
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
was three fire departments within the
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
town of hail that was hail Corner North
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
havil and Woodsville so the town agreed
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
to if the
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
precincts uh approved to give up their
 
03:47:17.279 --> 03:47:18.870 align:start position:0%
precincts uh approved to give up their
fire

03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
fire
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they would join the
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
town fire department and then the town
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
would pay for the entire department and
 
03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
north havil and havil Corner both joined
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
the fire department which is now the
 
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
havil town of hail fire department uh
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Woodsville um the
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the first year didn't put
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
it they didn't allow it to be voted on
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
and I believe this year um they turned
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
it down so so they chose not to become
 
03:47:48.670 --> 03:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
part of the Town fire department

03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
hail no they they fall under the
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district okay so it's
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
their own Highway Department under the

03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um thank you sir
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
for being here um you folks are so
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
involved in this and it's you know and I
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
think we're all trying to get up to
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
speed to understand uh the
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
situation um I can't find the statute
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
that this is amending on online so I see
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
everything in its totality someone
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
testified they said this is the maybe it
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
was you uh that this is the only
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
situation in the entire State of New
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like this so if if you could
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
just take us back in time I'm trying to
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
understand why this is in state law in
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
the first first place uh was it because
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
there was so much division um somebody
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
just tried to settle it through
 
03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or how did this come to
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
pass uh this the original uh law I it
 
03:49:34.349 --> 03:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
predates me obviously um I believe the
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
um over the over time there's been
 
03:49:39.269 --> 03:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
numerous amendments and they've come
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
back to the state to amend it um I I
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
don't know I couldn't uh intelligently
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
speak to when the first law was enacted
 
03:49:50.349 --> 03:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
regarding this but I believe the recent
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
the most recent amendment to it I think
 
03:49:52.399 --> 03:49:53.469 align:start position:0%
the most recent amendment to it I think
was

03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
2009 if I'm if I'm H
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
correct well I I I just as a followup
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of History I was trying
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
to understand how how this came to pass
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
in the first place um
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
so my other question is one of the
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
people testified that if this law was
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
past people in Woodsville would be
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
double taxed and I wondered if you could
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
that um sure well I I can't speak to
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
what um I think it was Mr Robbins that
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
stated that I can't speak to what he
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
what he meant but um double taxed um
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
well no because when you pay into the
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
high highway uh tax the highway taxes in
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
the town you're contributing to all of
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
the town roads not just you know a
 
03:50:51.030 --> 03:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
specific Precinct so we like I said we
 
03:50:54.389 --> 03:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
all contribute um I guess I could say it
 
03:50:58.149 --> 03:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
like this for example we I I pay taxes
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the state and and by extension the um
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
the county for and that pays for the
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
State Police it pays for the county
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department yet havil we have
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
our own Town Police Department I mean
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
would you consider that double taxation
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't because the town chooses to
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
have our own Police Department so for
 
03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we have to raise the taxes through
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
the town and pay for that it doesn't it
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't relinquish us of our
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to contribute to the
 
03:51:34.110 --> 03:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
state police or the county sheriff's
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
department we can't say oh we have our
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
own we don't want to contribute I I I I
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
don't see that as double taxation um it
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
just if you want to improve your
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
services to your specific community as
 
03:51:47.070 --> 03:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
we do with the town for example with the
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
police department it's just a burden
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we have to shoulder if we want that
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
so I I really wouldn't see that ma'am is
 
03:51:53.359 --> 03:51:54.189 align:start position:0%
so I I really wouldn't see that ma'am is
double

03:51:54.189 --> 03:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
double
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
taxation just one more followup Mr
 
03:52:02.110 --> 03:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
chair um okay so there's been a couple
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
of statements regarding local control
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
what is and isn't local control is it
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
your testimony then that the laws that
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
currently exist does not allow for local
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
control and if this bill was passed it
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
would return local control to um the
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
people of havil and
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
Woodsville yes ma'am absolutely just as
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
I had stated before if it would allow it
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
would it would unshackle the town and we
 
03:52:32.670 --> 03:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be paying for a
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
department of another municipality so if
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
Woodsville wants to have a fire a a
 
03:52:44.149 --> 03:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
road a highway department for themselves
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
then pay for it and then they the
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in Woodsville decides how big
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
they need or how you know how much they
 
03:52:52.590 --> 03:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
want to spend to take care of their
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
eight miles of Road and then that would
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
allow the town to take care of its roads
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
raises thank
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%

hail Cooperative School board chairman
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I've spent 35 or plus years in the
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
town of havil on various boards and
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
commissions including being the
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Board of Commissioners
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman in 2008 and N when the current
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed this current
 
03:54:32.349 --> 03:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislation was the work of uh unanimous
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
work of the hail select board and the
 
03:54:36.670 --> 03:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
Woodsville commission um the select
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
board under Rick lad we all know and um
 
03:54:42.750 --> 03:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
Town manager Glenn English and it solves
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
some real problems that bill in 200
 
03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh9 uh did receive unanimous support but
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
the ones the before you today is not
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
receiving unanimous support locally in
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
fact I believe you'll find that two of
 
03:55:01.389 --> 03:55:01.399 align:start position:0%
the five tal select board members are
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
registered as opposed to it on your list
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
today and all of the Woodsville Precinct
 
03:55:10.349 --> 03:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are opposed to it as well
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill before you today
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
recreates the very problem that the
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
current law was was
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
solving it has Woodsville property I'm
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
sorry Woodsville taxpayers paying for
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
its own highway department plus a large
 
03:55:28.830 --> 03:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
share of the cost of the haal depart
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
department and it is considered or it
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
was considered double taxation back in
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
2009 the current loss solve the problem
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
and it works like this the people served
 
03:55:43.030 --> 03:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
by the Woodsville Highway Department pay
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
for the Woodsville Highway Department
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
the people in hail that are served by
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the hail Highway Department pay for the
 
03:55:52.110 --> 03:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
hail Highway Department that is how it
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
works all of the in all of the
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
discussion today about how hail people
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
are paying for Woodsville or subsidizing
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
it's just plain ontrue and it's it's I
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
think because the people that are
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to you don't fully understand
 
03:56:10.990 --> 03:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
how it works I think Rick lad has a very
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
good handle on it and I'm sure he's
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
spoken to you about in the past one nice
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
lady just a moment ago asked about um
 
03:56:23.790 --> 03:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
the Woodsville Highway um uh having its
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
own department and I'll just throw in
 
03:56:28.269 --> 03:56:28.279 align:start position:0%
that um we've had two Highway
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
departments and it's been mutually
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial and serve the town and
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
Village well for a very very long time
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps up to about a hundred years um
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
the bill we're talking about today is
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
only about
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
funding why are we here and and I'm
 
03:56:45.790 --> 03:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
sorry but let me be a little blunt about
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
this prior to 2019 hail was a very
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
peaceful and Cooperative town the
 
03:56:52.750 --> 03:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
highway departments work together when
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
they needed a little extra help um we
 
03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
didn't keep a ledger of the time we just
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
did it um since the hiring of our new
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
town manager Woodsville has been under
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
siege from town management you will find
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the town manager is articulate and
 
03:57:09.189 --> 03:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
Charming as you've just heard but she
 
03:57:11.229 --> 03:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
has worked hard to disrupt all the
 
03:57:13.750 --> 03:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
relationships using bullying tactics
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
that incl include threats of defunding
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
to enlisting uh you folks in conquer to
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
be uh her heavy hand she has defunded
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Woodsville fire department um over a
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
control issue she has threatened hail
 
03:57:27.439 --> 03:57:31.469 align:start position:0%
control issue she has threatened hail
Corner

03:57:31.469 --> 03:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
Fire and they have pardon me she have
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
threatened havil Corner Fire Department
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
over um defunding and they finally gave
 
03:57:42.750 --> 03:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
in she's attempted to defund or reduce
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
the funding or replace Woodsville
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance of which I was a member um and
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
still am for over 40 years now and the
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
public did speak up very har harshly
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
about that and they backed away from it
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
she's refused to pay the town's
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
obligations to the Woodsville sewer
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
department and she has Enlisted the
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
Senate and now the house to fight
 
03:58:06.189 --> 03:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
letting Woodsville keep its local share
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
of Highway funds the people of hail are
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
not sending money to Woodsville if they
 
03:58:13.469 --> 03:58:13.479 align:start position:0%
took the time to understand how it works
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
they would know that that the funding of
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
our Highway departments is simple if you
 
03:58:20.229 --> 03:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
make an effort to understand it when
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
this started the town manager and select
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
board didn't understand how it works and
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
they believed havil was subsidizing
 
03:58:28.510 --> 03:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
Woodville and when the town manager in
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
charge and as we recently found out she
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
has blockaded any efforts recent efforts
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
to get together and discuss this as a
 
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
group sorry I'm stammering a little bit
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not a great speaker at every turn
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
over the last two years the town manager
 
03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
has been building a wall between hail
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
and Woodsville as the hail school board
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
chair I fear where this is going there
 
03:58:54.149 --> 03:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
is now a strong sentiment in Woodsville
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
to disengage from haville this bill as
 
03:58:59.070 --> 03:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
written could be that final Brick in the
 
03:59:02.590 --> 03:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
Wall sorry for the Pink Floyd reference
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
if Woodsville splits from the school
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
district we will have a real problem
 
03:59:10.269 --> 03:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
keeping our table Cooperative school
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
system going this bill is no more than a
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
tool that the town manager has found to
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
further her agenda I ask that you reject
 
03:59:21.149 --> 03:59:21.159 align:start position:0%
this and return these discussions to the
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
local level we're given a we're given a
 
03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
recent petition for her U dismissal and
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
voters taking back control of the select
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
board I believe we have a chance of
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
resolving this locally if you will
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
return this issue to us today thank you
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%

problem I I'm not exactly sure what
 
04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
problem merging the fire departments is
 
04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
trying to solve um we have been training

our fire department Woodsville has been
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
training with the other two departments
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
for years they've done group purchasing
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
for years um we only have a a fire chief
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
with a $10,000 salary I'm not really
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what problem they're trying
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%

2015 I also went back for a brief period
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
of time
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%

a new town
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
manager um I was a town resident and
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer during my tenure and continue
 
04:02:32.110 --> 04:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
to happily reside in the town I pay
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
taxes to both the town and the
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district where I am
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
involved in a family business during my
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
tenure as hail Town manager I and the
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen worked hard hard to
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
establish and maintain a positive
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the several
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
Village districts which provides some
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
defined Municipal services to their
 
04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
constituents within the greater town I
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
think the definition of municipality has
 
04:03:03.870 --> 04:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
been um misinterpreted by some of the
 
04:03:03.880 --> 04:03:04.950 align:start position:0%
been um misinterpreted by some of the
people

04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
testifying uh to me a
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
municipality that is totally separate
 
04:03:12.510 --> 04:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
from another municipality is not the
 
04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
same thing as a fire district or a
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
village District Municipal unit within a
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%

04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
use the woods use the roads in
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
Woodsville as well as tourists it's our
 
04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
business center all of the many of the
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
people in Woodsville use the roads in
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
hav so it's not like there are two
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
distinct municipalities with a brick
 
04:03:41.110 --> 04:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
wall between them that's a that's a
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
fallacy um
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
many of the other districts provide
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
services that benefit the whole town as
 
04:03:51.630 --> 04:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
well um I won't go into that detail but
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
we have about four different village
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
districts Water and Light departments
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
are done locally in the district level
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
um and one of our districts Mount Lakes
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
has a aggressive Recreation Department
 
04:04:07.950 --> 04:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
that benefits the whole town in
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
instances um we have um our Traditions
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
honor government services at the very
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
local level that is why we have so much
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
diversity of our local government and
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
the town Administration the current T
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
Administration doesn't understand that
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh this has worked well over the years
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
as long as the lines of communication
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
have remained open and Cooperative
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is not now the case
 
04:04:34.840 --> 04:04:35.630 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is not now the case
in

04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:04:38.110 --> 04:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
havil as I see it this proposed
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
legislation will end Fair Taxation and
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
local control for the Woodsville tax
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
fairs it will also mandate overly
 
04:04:48.750 --> 04:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
extensive audit requirements on the
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
district well beyond any audit
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
requirements of any other
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
municipality s sp26 will end the long
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
established practice of returning a
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of Highway funds raised by
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
property taxation in the Town based on
 
04:05:07.830 --> 04:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
the town's assessed values to the haal
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who live in Woodsville the
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
Woodsville taxpayers are also haval tax
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers you need to understand that
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
very important this would result in hail
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in Woodsville paying for two
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
Highway departments paying for two
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
Highway departments double
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
taxation the second issue local control
 
04:05:34.990 --> 04:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
requires a brief look at history the
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Highway Department predates
 
04:05:39.550 --> 04:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
the towns Highway Department it was
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
established in the late 1800s to build
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
and maintain Woods city
 
04:05:47.790 --> 04:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
streets these streets are paved and in
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
some cases have Curbing and sidewalks
 
04:05:53.229 --> 04:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
enclosed Drainage Systems they are
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
expensive to maintain in relation to the
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
town's roads which are rural mostly dirt
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
with open ditches for drainage the
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in Woodsville are happy and
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
have been happy with their local Highway
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
Department in fact the Woodsville Fire
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
District boundaries were enlarged by the
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in the early 1990s because the
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
town was doing such a poor job
 
04:06:18.590 --> 04:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining Swiftwater road which
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
Hospital since the town government began
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
to make incorrect allocation of the
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
highway funds to be returned to the
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
district under the present Town manager
 
04:06:35.550 --> 04:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
a violation of the current statute by
 
04:06:38.110 --> 04:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
the way the district Commissioners were
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
forced to sue the town to protect their
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a mediated settlement or Court
 
04:06:48.149 --> 04:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
action could ultimately decide the issue
 
04:06:49.870 --> 04:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
if resolution is
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
achieved um any required enabling
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislative action can be brought to the
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
legislature by both the town and the
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
district as has been done successfully
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the past I strongly urge you to vote
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%

town center of Hao Corner Woodsville in
 
04:08:42.109 --> 04:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
the district of Mountain Lakes We Are
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
One community but unfortunately we are
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
not all treated fairly or equally by the
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature when it comes
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
to our taxes taxation or how we spend it
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
for a little history in 1990 there was a
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
request for revision to the legislation
 
04:09:00.910 --> 04:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
for the distribution of Highway funds to
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
the Woodsville fire district it is
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
important to note that five of the six
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
individuals making this request were
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
residents of Woodsville much the same
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
happened in 2009 with another new legisl
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
ly mandated formula for the
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
subsidization of Woodsville on both
 
04:09:20.750 --> 04:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
occasions there was no Town vote only a
 
04:09:22.990 --> 04:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
decision by elected inhabitants of
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
Woodsville four of the five members of
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
the select board in 2009 were residents
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
of Woodsville meaning most involved
 
04:09:33.309 --> 04:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
personally profited or benefited more
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
than other citizens in hail as
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislators I am sure you understand the
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
ethics of such a
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
situation almost two years ago the
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
select board voted you name iously to
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
pursue the statutory changes necessary
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
to make our road maintenance fair and
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
Equitable discussions with the
 
04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district were quickly
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
negated by Woodsville Commissioners
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
smiling and stating the formula is a law
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the law is the law we cannot change
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
it on the town level negotiations were
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
not and are not possible with such
 
04:10:09.389 --> 04:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
comments as and I quote no review of the
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
process is needed nor will it be
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
tolerated the state statute stands in
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
the way since the first hearing held in
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate which passed the repeal 240
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
in 2019 hail select board members have
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
been threatened and made to feel
 
04:10:29.109 --> 04:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
unsafe Town manager Bridget carding has
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
been called useless and psychotic and
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
bimbo previous Town manager Glenn
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
English who you just heard from said he
 
04:10:40.269 --> 04:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
would in I quote crucify her if she
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
attempted to change the Woodsville
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
Highway funding formula
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
codling has been the recipient of
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
exploding pornographic messages and
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
warned by citizens concerned for her
 
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
safety that she should not travel
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
unarmed there has been much said and
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
written about the town of havil in
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
Westville fire district in local control
 
04:11:03.149 --> 04:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
there are people who have and will
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
testify the state law mandating Hao
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers give Woodsville more than
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
$53,000 a mile for its eight miles of
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
road is a local issue that needs to be
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
settled locally we can
 
04:11:20.469 --> 04:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
not only you can repeal the law
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
requiring haval taxpayers to give their
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
tax money by a legislative mandate to
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville the issue of roads and
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of money has been a
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
divisive issue for many years Woodsville
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
which has eight miles of road to
 
04:11:37.309 --> 04:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
maintain is legislatively granted
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
$551,000 per mile the rest of hayo
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
services 72 mil a road with 90 $700 per
 
04:11:47.469 --> 04:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
mile left from the taxes raised the
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers can only afford so much and
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
currently the New Hampshire legislature
 
04:11:54.189 --> 04:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
is the only place the hayro taxpayers
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
can get released they are mandated to
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
give Woodsville their tax
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
dollars until the issue became
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and a new town manager was
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
hired no one really knew what was
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
happening a quick look at the book
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
showed poor stewardship in a situation
 
04:12:13.149 --> 04:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
where Woodville was overpaid theand
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
mated amount just the years 2016 17 18
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and 19 represent an overpayment by the
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of hayo to the precinct of
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
Woodsville of almost
 
04:12:28.189 --> 04:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
$800,000 our solution which is before
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
you today giv every road mile equal
 
04:12:33.550 --> 04:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
status regardless of where it begins
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
where it goes or how many deer or bear
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
cross over them it will end the
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislative mandates upon the hay
 
04:12:43.149 --> 04:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and allow everyone to be
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
treated as
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
equals every Precinct has the ability to
 
04:12:50.349 --> 04:12:50.359 align:start position:0%
create whatever Services it wants so
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
long as the want is paid for by a
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
Precinct tax and is in accordance with
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
state law a water company electric
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
company ambulance service or fire
 
04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
department if they want it they can have
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
it and pay for it I am of the opinion
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the existing law has allowed those
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for the serious Financial
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
Obligations that have been precipitated
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
investigations by the Dr and the
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to act with
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
impunity they believe they can
 
04:13:21.429 --> 04:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
manipulate the legislature through a
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
couple of elected
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
representatives this has given the
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a belief that if you have
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
money you can even take more from the
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
little guy the working family by having
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
friends in
 
04:13:36.109 --> 04:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
conquered it's time for equal treatment
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
of all people of the town of hail please
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
remove the Mandate the legislature
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
created which interferes in hail's right
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
to govern itself please allow hail
 
04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the ability to control their
 
04:13:48.560 --> 04:13:49.349 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the ability to control their
own

04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
destiny please restore the faith people
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
need to have in its government and most
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
of all those elected to
 
04:13:59.229 --> 04:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
govern it is interesting to note that
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has just found the
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district guilty on two
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
counts of
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
electioneering it is my understanding
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
there are six more counts pending
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
ironically this returns one of the
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
Woodsville residents Michael Graham who
 
04:14:16.590 --> 04:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
benefited in signed Road legislation to
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
the Hao select board after a 20-year
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hiatus from using government mail paid
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
for by taxpayers to having the police
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
remove legal signs from private property
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation and its profits to
 
04:14:33.309 --> 04:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
those in Woodsville pushes the limits of
 
04:14:33.319 --> 04:14:34.710 align:start position:0%
those in Woodsville pushes the limits of
criminal

04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
activity the use of government mail has
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
been brushed off by the state election
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
officials because the lifetime CEO
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me if we could focus on
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and not allegations of other
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing or other problems within the
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%

havil taxpayers subsidize the private

Enterprises of Woodsville Commissioners
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%

thank you sir I I I miss it sort of not
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
the zoom though thank you Mr chairman
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
record I was a member of the legislature
 
04:15:45.309 --> 04:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate I spent 14
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
years and um I I truly do understand
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
what you give up to be a volunteer
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
citizen legislator and I will say right
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
now I would never support any other type
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
of legisl legislature because I think
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
this is the way things get done as to to
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
cill 26 the reason why I'm even involved
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
as a few years ago I just just for the
 
04:16:12.109 --> 04:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
record I like to restore historical
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
structures so I was approached because a
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
few historical structures were going to
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
um be either demolished or turned into
 
04:16:23.109 --> 04:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
apartments and I agreed to buy them and
 
04:16:24.910 --> 04:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
fix them right now I have
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
four um two of them are under
 
04:16:30.109 --> 04:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
Renovations and and two others are not
 
04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
yet but I I also somehow got involved
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
politically and part of it was because
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
the tax base um havil I think is the
 
04:16:44.189 --> 04:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
fifth highest tax
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh community in the state of New
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I started looking at my
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
appraisals and the appraisals of other
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
important people and said okay um
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
something's not right so as we started
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
looking up came the uh Road money I
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
remember they were buying a grater for
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and had to raise $1 130 so that
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
they could give Woodsville $30,000
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
directly so we started looking at
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what was happening but what we
 
04:17:12.319 --> 04:17:13.870 align:start position:0%
exactly what was happening but what we
have

04:17:13.870 --> 04:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
is is a is a longstanding dispute and to
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
to representative eel this started in
 
04:17:23.309 --> 04:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
the late 1800s and there's actually a
 
04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
court case a Supreme Court case in the
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire from
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
1893 and it just happened to discuss if
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
if Woodsville took care of its own roads
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
who were responsible for any accidents
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
or who held the liability and the court
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
back then said havil holds the Li
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
liability regardless of who actually
 
04:17:47.790 --> 04:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
does it because hail is the town that
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
actually owns Woodsville in a sense so
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
and it and it's just gone on over and
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
over again now the reason why there was
 
04:17:57.389 --> 04:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
a dispute is because in the late 1800s
 
04:18:00.269 --> 04:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
the railroad was making a decision
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
originally hail Corner was the center of
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
the universe up there and that's where
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
all the circuit courts met I think three
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
months a year um every house in havil
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
corner including the ones I own were
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
either a Tavern a bed and breakfast or
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
both during all those years because
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
there was no place else for people to
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
stay so what happened was the the
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
railroad suddenly became the boss and if
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
you look at all of the the history for
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire you will find
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the railroad became too powerful
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
controlled the legislature to the point
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
where there was an actual um serious
 
04:18:42.510 --> 04:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
fight to get the railroad out so you add
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
into end up having money um allocated
 
04:18:47.399 --> 04:18:48.309 align:start position:0%
into end up having money um allocated
based

04:18:48.309 --> 04:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
based
 
04:18:48.319 --> 04:18:49.870 align:start position:0%
based
on

04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
um powerful
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
influences but it brings us to 2009 in
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
2009 as uh uh Mr claron said um there
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
were four people who were Selectmen that
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
were uh members of Woodsville and one
 
04:19:11.469 --> 04:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
who who belonged in in havil corner um
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
who happened to be a state repap now
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
when you hear the testimony earlier that
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
said that uh the Commissioners in
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
Woodsville approved this deal and the
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
the uh selectman approved the deal well
 
04:19:25.950 --> 04:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
when you have what do we have eight
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
people and seven of them are going to
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
benefit financially it's pretty hard not
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
to have eight people who are going to
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
agree now you also hear that um people
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
have said the law is the law and that's
 
04:19:43.710 --> 04:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what's happened and
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
2009 um the representative and the state
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
senator uh put this before and I found
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
out from the representative on April
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
26th that they had a hard time actually
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting the bill from 2009 through the
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
legislature didn't like it so they
 
04:20:02.910 --> 04:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
pulled a trick where you take it and you
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
put it in house bill to I'm sure you
 
04:20:08.429 --> 04:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
most of you uh understand that that
 
04:20:11.550 --> 04:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
process and that's how it came about
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
because it it was
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
then looked at as hey wait a minute I'm
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
not sure this is
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
fair so anyways it became
 
04:20:23.710 --> 04:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
law and then the more they looked at it
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
they looked and said as you heard from
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
Jennifer um in 2018 or 19 they found
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
that they were making
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
overpayments and a
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
previous um manager actually had
 
04:20:37.950 --> 04:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
admitted that yes he knew he was
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
overpaying Woodsville but he felt that
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
they deserved it but he also lives
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville um and and so you know we go
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
on and on and on it's been very
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to sit with them and yes I've
 
04:20:54.429 --> 04:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
been with Senator guer and and and Rick
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
lad in the beginning and we looked at it
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
and said how do we fix it well I I don't
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
blame Woodsville they smile and say
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to fix we get almost
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars a year because
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature says we do so what is
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
there to talk about there's no reason to
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
you and that's why we have to here
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rick lad said in 2019
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
when the bill that this was in was a big
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill and it was vetoed by the
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
governor because there was too much in
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
it um he said it's it it's it's none of
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
conquer's business conquer needs to get
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
its nose out of hail's business and I
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
agree with what he said but I don't
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
think he agrees with
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
why I agree that conquet should take its
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
noes out of hail's business
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
why does conquer think it's okay for
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
them to say havil gets this much
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
money and out of that money they have to
 
04:21:54.510 --> 04:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
give this much to one
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
Precinct now the
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
precinct doesn't need the money they
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
said well they do because they want all
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
the tax money but when you look at it
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
all of havil including them use all the
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
roads so havil says we use Woodsville
 
04:22:12.269 --> 04:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
roads you use havil roads we all use
 
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
every everybody's roads together so why
 
04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and why aren't we paying together and
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
what woodville's return return is it
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what you use we take care
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
of our roads and we'll take all of our
 
04:22:27.910 --> 04:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
money well you know it's
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
$420,000 a
 
04:22:33.149 --> 04:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
year that we can't afford I'm a taxpayer
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm speaking as a taxpayer now we
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
can't keep doing this
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
now there's a second part of this bill
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm surprised nobody talked about
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
and it's the Audits and the audits are
 
04:22:47.319 --> 04:22:48.590 align:start position:0%
and it's the Audits and the audits are
tied

04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
tied
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
closely to to the road money which is
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
why they Dr asked to put their piece
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the audits show the misuse of Road
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
money some of you have been on the
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee long enough to know that
 
04:23:04.030 --> 04:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
federal and state money comes with
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
caveats there are certain things you can
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
and can't do with it but how many of you
 
04:23:13.149 --> 04:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
know that in 2009
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
they have they had
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to see where it was the
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the the statement was made this will
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
provide Woodsville Precinct with another
 
04:23:30.109 --> 04:23:30.119 align:start position:0%
$100,000 which will help in maintaining
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
the sewer system water
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
sidewalks problem is is all of those are
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
privately owned Enterprise systems not
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
entitled to taxpayer money and not
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to Road money Road money is
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used for roads it's not
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used to repair the water
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
system especially when it's a for-profit
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
business so when they started asking for
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
audits out of
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville the town manager of havil
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
said to Dr oh don't worry about it's a
 
04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of good old boys they just don't
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
understand but we know everything is
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay but as he
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
left certain things came up and Dr said
 
04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
we need the help of the legislature
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
because we need to do this audit now um
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
they've done the audit because the AG
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
has stepped in and Dr has stepped in and
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
and I have um looked at it they have
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
some serious uh issues one that bothers
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
me the most having been on the New
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh on the
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
board when I was in the legislature
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
um 11 years of having an employee they
 
04:24:46.960 --> 04:24:48.149 align:start position:0%
um 11 years of having an employee they
called

04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
part-time and I guess he was
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
collecting but he um uh they were
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
calling him part-time and then paying
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
him something that was called compal
 
04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
time basically they were paying the
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman $90 an hour in telling the
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system that he was just
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
getting a pittance these are the things
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
that we're finding in the audit the
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
electric company is another one it's
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a municipally owned
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
Enterprise yet it sells um electricity
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
across state line which makes it
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
Federal the Pu is under the impression
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that
 
04:25:26.109 --> 04:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
because it's a municipally owned and it
 
04:25:29.149 --> 04:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
only Services itself it can't regulate
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
it and the the answer to the federal is
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
we don't sell anything across state
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
lines well they
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
do and and where's the money I was part
 
04:25:40.830 --> 04:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:25:45.149 --> 04:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
team that was um hired by someone to go
 
04:25:47.790 --> 04:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
in and look for the money I've sat with
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
dick guy I've asked for the
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
information um I was told he doesn't
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
have it I was taken to the
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the superintendent
 
04:25:58.149 --> 04:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
turned white we thought he was going to
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
have a heart attack and said I don't
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
have the books only dick guy does so I'm
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
not making any accusations I'm only
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
telling you what's in the audits what
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
I've experienced myself part two of this
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill is just as important as part part
 
04:26:15.870 --> 04:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
one part one says to the
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislature kind of get out of our
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
business 8 Miles a road is nothing for
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
havil to take over and I will tell you
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
that the the fight um in havil during
 
04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
the last election was to make sure that
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
the grater and the dump truck that was
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to to to work the roads um
 
04:26:38.560 --> 04:26:40.389 align:start position:0%
necessary to to to work the roads um
couldn't

04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
be they couldn't keep the lease contract
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
so they did something that basically
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
defunded but uh to the managers the town
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
manager's um credit she found another
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
way to make sure that she kept the
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
equipment to keep the roads going so
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
what we have is we have a a big
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
fight you're not going to fix the fight
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
over the roads unless the legislature
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
says it's not our business it's your
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
business and then I guarantee you
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's a group of people who want to
 
04:27:18.269 --> 04:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
sit down and work it
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
out but Woodsville is not going to get
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
$420,000 a year because the town of
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
havil in its different precincts if
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
you're making money off the water and
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
you're making money off of selling
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
electricity and you're making money off
 
04:27:34.830 --> 04:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
of selling the sewer
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
use then then you shouldn't be taking
 
04:27:41.670 --> 04:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
our money to maintain them you should be
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
using your money the money you make off
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
of selling that
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
product and that's what we're asking
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to take conquered out
 
04:27:54.189 --> 04:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
of the road
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
money and I'm asking you to um make sure
 
04:27:59.560 --> 04:28:00.229 align:start position:0%
money and I'm asking you to um make sure
that

04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
Dr can finish its audit work and it's
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
not just
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
Woodsville that would have to follow
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
this audit process it's everyone it's
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
time that
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers had the ability
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
to see exactly what it is people do with
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
the money that's raised in
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated I can tell you that one
 
04:28:23.469 --> 04:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
investigator I know has been on this
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
since 2009 on the electric they still
 
04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
can't find out where the money goes
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting close because Dr
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
is forcing the
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
audit and and um there's a lot of things
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
happening a lot of people trying to
 
04:28:41.790 --> 04:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
cover but but the reality is the people
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
in in in havil as a town all five
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
precincts a good
 
04:28:50.109 --> 04:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
hardworking people they're working
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
families and they're trying to keep
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
their head above
 
04:28:58.510 --> 04:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
water being number five in taxes in the
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire these are simple
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
people there's not a lot of luxuries
 
04:29:07.830 --> 04:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
there and it's not fair the only fair
 
04:29:09.550 --> 04:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
thing is for the state of New
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legislature to say
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is your problem we're repealing the
 
04:29:17.469 --> 04:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
Mandate that you give them this money
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
and you passed the second set so that
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
the people in Woodsville as whether the
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
PE as as well as the people in haville
 
04:29:27.750 --> 04:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
know what actually happened to all the
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
money they've been fun fun funneling
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
into that
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
division Mr chairman I'm going to send
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
in my original
 
04:29:40.469 --> 04:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
testimony I wanted to make sure that um
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
I answered some of the questions I hope
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
hope I did I'd be more than happy to
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
answer more um I've been around a long
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
time as some of you know I've been a
 
04:29:50.830 --> 04:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
selectman I've been a budget Committee
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
Member I was a member of the House for
 
04:29:56.349 --> 04:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
eight years I was a member of the Senate
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
and that drove me out um but I I I I
 
04:30:00.560 --> 04:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
and that drove me out um but I I I I
fully

04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
fully
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
done go ahead and finish Sor no actually
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
I actually I'm I'm I'm I'm done Mr
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I want you to know I'm
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
passionate I I have a place up there
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm probably going to
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
retire I
 
04:30:27.510 --> 04:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a beautiful it's a
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful Community but what's been
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
happening to it over the years just
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
isn't right and and it's because um
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
people in hav roll are old fashion um
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rights and they believe
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
that everybody is trustworthy and
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not the case
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative EO you got a question yes
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh Mr CLE for
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
the history lesson it just really helps
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
put some things in context so if I um
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
may see seem like a small point
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
considering everything else you
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
testified to but if I understand what
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
you just said there really wasn't a lot
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
in this statute about funding until 20 9
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
and when that and and that was
 
04:31:18.269 --> 04:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
introduced I understand as part as of
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's because at that point
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
there was already vast disagreement
 
04:31:23.920 --> 04:31:24.950 align:start position:0%
there was already vast disagreement
going

04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
on let me let me just say there there
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
was there was a formula in there but it
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
was nowhere near this and what it said
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
was that havil had to give Woodsville up
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
to a certain amount of money which meant
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
that if Haver was spending $9,000
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
a mile on its own roads it had to give
 
04:31:48.030 --> 04:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
$99,000 a mile for the other eight eight
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
miles but it also said that should some
 
04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
kind of catastrophe happen in in in
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
Woodsville that hail would would would
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
continue to be part of the thing it
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't until
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
2009 that greed took over and that's
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
problem see no further question oh

to be careful with some of the
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
information I would strongly suggest
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
that you get with Senator guer and speak
 
04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the the gentleman at Dr that's in
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
charge of this okay all right as
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%

04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
passes does it solve the
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
problem it it solves the problem because
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
it allows people to sit
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
down and and as I said with all due
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
respect if I was part of Woodsville and
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
I was getting
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
$420,000 I wouldn't sit and negotiate it
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
away but if it's gone would sit there
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
and negotiate how best to care for the
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
roads thank
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
you now further
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
04:33:53.879 --> 04:33:55.390 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
sir

04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
um Mr stepen
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
Wheeler yes can you hear me yes yes well
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
first comment would be that the audits
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
are done all the way through 2017 and 18
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
and 19 are almost done and there is no
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
money missing there's been no
 
04:34:15.390 --> 04:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of money the money that
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
comes into the precinct for Water and
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
Light is completely different than what
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
it comes into the precinct for roads and
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
them because Water and Light and the
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
sewer system and the ambulance system
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
are all Enterprise systems so that money
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with wood thrill roads
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
and I've heard the figure of 500,000
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
400,000 425,000 we only get what is a do
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
us for the money I A precent
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner we get
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
23.6% of the road money because
 
04:34:49.390 --> 04:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
23.6% of the tax dollars are paid by the
 
04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
people of Woodsville they would like it
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get any of the money but
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is a fallacy and there's a lot of
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
other things that were fallacies that
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
would have spoken about by the gentleman
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
in front of me first of all the
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
Woodville Road started in
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
1898 this was due to because of the
 
04:35:08.670 --> 04:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
railroads as he mentioned and the City
 
04:35:10.349 --> 04:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
of Woodsville which is not a city but
 
04:35:12.750 --> 04:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's a town was built like a city
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
because we had to have a sewer system
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
and storm drains because water doesn't
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
run down the streets too well and when
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're Tire Woodsville had a road crew
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
30 years before the town had a road
 
04:35:27.070 --> 04:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
crew Woodsville maintenance agreements
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
have been modified many times over all
 
04:35:31.709 --> 04:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
these years and the valuation has grown
 
04:35:34.109 --> 04:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
this is based on property evaluations
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
assessing a tax assessments the last
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
update was held in 2008 which took
 
04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
effect in 2009 that last agreement has
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
worked fine until
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
2019 at that time the board of Select
 
04:35:48.910 --> 04:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
under the advisement of the Town manager
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
changed the formula without the precinct
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
of Woodville having any
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
input when they have a memorandum of
 
04:35:56.830 --> 04:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
understanding you have to have all
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
parties involved in the changing of of
 
04:35:59.320 --> 04:36:00.830 align:start position:0%
parties involved in the changing of of
an

04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
agreement it appears the SP board and
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
the town manager do not understand the
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
full understanding that that formul and
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
it was agreed to in 2008 because a lack
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
of understanding the precinct of
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
Woodville is not received their portion
 
04:36:14.910 --> 04:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
of the taxes collected to appy the road
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
M this year at all we're supposed to get
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
it every quarter we haven't got a scent
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
yet and he talked about the uh the
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
select board actually in 2008 there was
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
only four members on the select board
 
04:36:30.429 --> 04:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
because one had resigned when this was
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
done and they did not replace that
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
person until August and this the the
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
agreement was signed in April and two
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
were from hail and two were from
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
Woodsville but there all elected by the
 
04:36:45.070 --> 04:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
town people of the town of hail so it's
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
not a lopsided board as he said and I
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact because in August
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
my wife came back on to serve her 11th
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
year on the select board at that year
 
04:36:56.670 --> 04:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
she had been a selectman all those years
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
so I know that for a
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
fact the Woodville Precinct
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have tried to arrange a
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
meeting with a ha ha select board uh
 
04:37:08.109 --> 04:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
many times and they refuse to meet with
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
us they said they couldn't meet until
 
04:37:13.470 --> 04:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit was over well all we have a
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
we have a copy from their lawyer and our
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer that said that we should meet
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
because before we can even go to court
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
there has to be a mediation agreement
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
between the two so I don't know where it
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
is but and when one of the select board
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
members asked the town manager about
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
this letter and this email she said I've
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
never heard of it well five minutes
 
04:37:35.709 --> 04:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
before that selectman got to her office
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
the next morning and she put on to I
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
guess I misunderstood what they were
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
talking about I mean it's just been a
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
same thing all the time that
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
23.6% of the road money comes back to
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville because 23% of the road money
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
is paid by the presinct to Woodsville I
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
don't know why we shouldn't get the
 
04:37:54.750 --> 04:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
money back that we've that was due us
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
because our taxpayers have be double
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
taxation again and they're also getting
 
04:38:00.670 --> 04:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
double tax stations on the fire
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
department which we give 23.6% of the
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
money to the town fire department and we
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
don't get a sent back when we have our
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
own fire
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
department um and it it's just keeps
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
going and the police call they said that
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
75% of the police calls well I contacted
 
04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
the U dispatch because all our dispatch
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
goes through Grafton County Sheriff
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
department and in the in the last
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
ensuing year 31.6% of the police calls
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
were in Woodsville at not 75%
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
31.6 was was done in Woodsville and most
 
04:38:36.029 --> 04:38:36.039 align:start position:0%
of those were to Walmart which we kind
 
04:38:36.039 --> 04:38:36.990 align:start position:0%
of those were to Walmart which we kind
of

04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
expected so I I mean the people in
 
04:38:43.230 --> 04:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
Woodsville we had our annual meeting uh
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
two weeks after the
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
town after the town meeting and the
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
voters in Woodville at the annual
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
meeting for the precin of Woodsville the
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
sentiment for Woodsville was to secede
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
from the town of hael over the years
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville has often perceived as a
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
separate town as many visitors to
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
Woodsville believe that they're in
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
charge lawyers come up to the courthouse
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
and they think Woodsville is its own
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
town they come to Woodsville we have all
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
the restaurants we have all the stores
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
we have all the businesses in Woodsville
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
for that stuff and the complaining about
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
tax money well all the rooms of meals
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
tax which is almost $200,000 a year goes
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
to the town we don't receive a sent of
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
it back and we have all the businesses I
 
04:39:22.349 --> 04:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
don't know what the hell the problem is
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
there I just get I just get sick of
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
hearing all this stuff all the time our
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
road crew has to be trained because they
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
do storm drains they have to be trained
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
to go under the road with their gas mask
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
and everything when they go under the
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
road to fix a storm drain or sewer grain
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
our road crew does fix the sewer grains
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
but the and the money that goes
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
Woodville Precinct um comes to Woodville
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
Precinct water lights its own entity I
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how he figured dick guy was
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
going to because he was a Precinct
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner was going to give him books
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the Water and Light department when
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've been a separate entity until last
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
year at town meeting our annual visit V
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
visit Village meeting when they said oh
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to join forces we had not
 
04:40:06.110 --> 04:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
been joined forces until the since the
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
1920s when Woodville water light was
 
04:40:09.948 --> 04:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
established so I don't know where we
 
04:40:11.708 --> 04:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
would have got that information from
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
I've been a I've been a commissioner for
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
over six years now and I can tell you
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's not one cent missing and the
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
audit that just came out there not one
 
04:40:22.510 --> 04:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
cent missing from Woodsville yes we were
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
common Layman we didn't have a manager
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
at the time we may not have done
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
everything right but there's no money
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
that went from Water and Light from the
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
precinct to Water and Light because the
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
two did not get along and the problem
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
was the guy taking the money that was
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
retired had nothing to do with the
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
Woodsboro road crew because we had no
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
control over the Woodsville Water and
 
04:40:44.110 --> 04:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
Light department they were their own
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
separate entity I just I just get sick
 
04:40:48.270 --> 04:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
of hearing well Woodsville is this
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is that there's no money
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
missing we just and Senate the GU was up
 
04:40:55.948 --> 04:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
there when they did the uh review of
 
04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%

district as you know there's been an
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
agreement in place between the town of
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
havil and Woodsville on returning Monies
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
to Woodsville for highways since
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
1990 this has been amicably amended
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
twice since being
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
created with the purpose of sparing
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Precinct residents and
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%

Highway departments
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
as Woodsville has operated its own since
 
04:43:16.030 --> 04:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
the late
 
04:43:18.750 --> 04:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
1880s there has been an there has been
 
04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
and is a disagreement on the funding of
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
Road monies between the two parties this
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
is a local issue and should not be
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
resolved with all due respect in
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
conquered the Woodsville Precinct
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners voted formally at their
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
last meeting that they were opposed to
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
this bill and I know as you've heard
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
today that there's two two of the five
 
04:43:39.628 --> 04:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
select board members are in opposition
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
of it as well
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
through the precincts attorney uh
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
they've reached out to the town to have
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
a meeting on road funding um and this
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
really needs time to play out they they
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
they need to get
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
together the second part of of the bill
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
um as amended is not relevant Woodsville
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
fire district is fully complying with
 
04:44:05.230 --> 04:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
having the necessary audits they're
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
being conducted by plik and
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
Sanderson uh three years are completed I
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
know that was an early question and 2018
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
and 19 are near completion we have also
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
as a district contracted with plasic for
 
04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
2020 that work will begin as soon as 19
 
04:44:27.070 --> 04:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
is done and I hope that 20 is completed
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
July I would argue that the language U
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of this should not be tied to
 
04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
any bill as it's an add-on and should
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
apply to all towns and districts equally
 
04:44:47.670 --> 04:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and should not
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
single out one
 
04:44:55.750 --> 04:44:55.760 align:start position:0%

04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we moved down here in 2004
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
from Alaska where we lived 25 years
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%

04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
Generations back founded the town of
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
havil New Hampshire and so I have a lot
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
of ties to this community I have chaired
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
the select board in havil um during 2009
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
very active on the select board at that
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
time I've also chaired the havil corner
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
commission which deals with the water
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
system there very active in local uh
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
Affairs um representative eel asked some
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions earlier about the history of
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh the U Road system in Woodsville I did
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
have the same question and then I asked
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
Beno peler who works in the office of
 
04:48:37.470 --> 04:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
legislative research here and he gave me
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
a report about a year ago and the first
 
04:48:43.020 --> 04:48:43.030 align:start position:0%
first issue that appears is in
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
first issue that appears is in
[Music]

04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
1877 then it goes 1887 1893 1899 a year
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
after the Spanish American war
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
1913 and then we get up to the years
 
04:48:56.750 --> 04:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we're more involved with and i'
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak to that just very quickly
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
and briefly in 1990 representative Paul
 
04:49:08.590 --> 04:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
Lamont put forward a bill it was HB 1138
 
04:49:10.830 --> 04:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
which dealt with the Woodsville Road
 
04:49:13.910 --> 04:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
system and how monies that were paid by
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
Woodsville folks and hail folks for the
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
highway budget up to 20% would be used
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
to support the system in Woodsville so
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
it went back to
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
1990 then s sp75 came about in 2009 that
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
was put forth when I was as a selectman
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
up there and chairing the select board
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
at the time but I also want to mention
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
to you that the other individuals that
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill and sponsored
 
04:49:44.830 --> 04:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill was Senator uh Deb Reynolds out of
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
Plymouth whom I know well and
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative Paul Inger Briton who
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
comes from Pike one of the areas within
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
havil which is not part of Woodsville
 
04:49:59.310 --> 04:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
there are districts within havil that
 
04:50:01.990 --> 04:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
have their own boards for various tasks
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
be it water be it fire be it planting
 
04:50:07.948 --> 04:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
havil corner where I live currently and
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
then you have North havil Pike and you
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
have Mountain Lakes is and Woodsville um
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
North havil havil Corner Mountain Lakes
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
are primarily residential oriented our
 
04:50:23.548 --> 04:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
revenues and our income especially if
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
you look at meals and room in rooms
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
income tax that stuff it all comes out
 
04:50:28.760 --> 04:50:29.868 align:start position:0%
income tax that stuff it all comes out
of

04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and so um there are also some
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh bills in the past which we should be
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
aware of before we get to 4 414 HB 414
 
04:50:44.548 --> 04:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
or to the uh Omnibus Bill we had last
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
year we've had memorandum of
 
04:50:48.750 --> 04:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
understanding signed by both the
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in Woodsville and the
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
select board dating back to
 
04:50:53.520 --> 04:50:55.230 align:start position:0%
select board dating back to
1990

04:50:55.230 --> 04:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
1990
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
1995 and then there was a proposal to
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the first amendment of
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
theou in uh 2008 prior to
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
2009 in 2009 when we worked with both
 
04:51:10.200 --> 04:51:11.070 align:start position:0%
2009 in 2009 when we worked with both
boards

04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
to develop this distribution funding
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
formula which is currently in law both
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
boards unanimously agreed to the
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
distribution formula in fact that's been
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
the way that all legislation referencing
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
the distribution formula has occurred
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's been unanimously agreed upon by all
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
those that are participating I might add
 
04:51:35.948 --> 04:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
that one of those select board members
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
that was living in Woodsville at that
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
time in 2009 is now living down the
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
street for me in havil corner when we
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
were on the board at that time and I was
 
04:51:48.190 --> 04:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
on that board we never thought of
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
ourselves as I'm from Woodsville I'm
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
from Mountain Lakes or I'm from North
 
04:51:56.590 --> 04:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
havil or havil Corner we represented all
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
of havil so when we made a decision we
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
made a decision in the best uh the
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
betterment of all the whole good of the
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
town we did that also when we changed
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
how fire departments were funded
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
we used to fund all our fire departments
 
04:52:16.110 --> 04:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
three of them havil Corner North havil
 
04:52:19.230 --> 04:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
and Woodsville by the precinct voters in
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
those areas but there's a lot of havil
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
not in those three areas and back before
 
04:52:28.510 --> 04:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
2009 or so the people outside these
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
precincts were not paying for fire
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
coverage at all so we changed that so
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
the town now assesses everybody for fire
 
04:52:37.868 --> 04:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
departments and the money was then
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
distributed to those individual Precinct
 
04:52:39.958 --> 04:52:41.590 align:start position:0%
distributed to those individual Precinct
departments

04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
and yes we do have a town fire
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
department now that was recently done by
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
way of Warrant article but the first
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
time the havil corner folks were asked
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
to support the new town uh fire
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
department they absolutely said no we
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't want anything to do with it we
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
need to see a long range plan as far
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
what are the costs going to be how our
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
fire insurance is going to be affected
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
all that well the same issue is now
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
roads we have Woodsville which is much
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
different than the rest of the community
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is the commercial center
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
Woodsville has sewer water sidewalks we
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
don't have that except in one location
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
in North havil uh along Route
 
04:53:35.910 --> 04:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
10 so the the cost of maintaining these
 
04:53:37.708 --> 04:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
roads when we're dealing with water
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
under the roads when we're dealing with
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
sewer sewer our course are going to have
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
to be more for those eight miles roads
 
04:53:46.190 --> 04:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
in Woodsville than the rest where it's
 
04:53:49.708 --> 04:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
dirt or gravel or pavement and but we
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
all see and share the same need to have
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
good Transportation throughout the
 
04:53:54.160 --> 04:53:56.310 align:start position:0%
good Transportation throughout the
entire

04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
Community we when we went back in 2009
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
and looked at this distribution formula
 
04:54:03.548 --> 04:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
I also asked at that time the town
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
manager Mr Glenn English who is an
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
excellent Town manager and has the techn
 
04:54:11.948 --> 04:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
technical skills to produce a fiscal
 
04:54:14.590 --> 04:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
report I asked him to put together a
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
long a plan which shows where are our
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
money's really being used to for because
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
at that time many people said well our
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
Police Department's always hanging out
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
in Woodsville so all our dollars are
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
being spent in Woodsville when we did
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
that analysis for all our departments it
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
came out of wash for the entire town
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
Woodsville was not receiving any more
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
than any other location within the
 
04:54:39.160 --> 04:54:40.708 align:start position:0%
than any other location within the
community

04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:54:43.628 --> 04:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
we also know in looking at projections
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
for where we're going in the next five
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
or 10 years the tax base is definitely
 
04:54:49.548 --> 04:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
going to be in
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and you you have places like
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
Walmart there now our meals and room
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
Stacks our restaurants our mo hotel
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
motel lodging is up there in
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and I see the revenues coming
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
into Woodsville being much higher than
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
that at the rest of the community but
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
what the rest of the community is
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
residential and as with any large
 
04:55:11.788 --> 04:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
municip IP ality or Municipality of
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
around 5,000 uh PE people in it you're
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
going to have certain areas which are
 
04:55:18.030 --> 04:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
residential and certain areas that more
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
urban and have Urban residential yes but
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
they are more oriented towards
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
Commercial Business which I don't think
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's too many days that go by that I
 
04:55:28.510 --> 04:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
don't don't drive up into Woodsville to
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
do my
 
04:55:33.070 --> 04:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
shopping so going on down here when HB
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
414 came up in
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um both boards met with repes
 
04:55:41.708 --> 04:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
Senator GAA and myself we were
 
04:55:43.868 --> 04:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
discussing what do we need to do with
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
this there was agreement on one issue
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
now some people said though well that
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
that nothing came out from that first
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
meeting yes it did we have Highway money
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
which goes to Woodsville that comes out
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the operating budget for the
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
community you know that you you've heard
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
the split but there's also a highway
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
block money Revenue which comes down
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
from the state from dot to
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and because it goes to
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities not to precincts or
 
04:56:14.990 --> 04:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
districts then the share which goes down
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
to Woodsville comes by way of the town
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
and it's dispersed out we have been
 
04:56:23.230 --> 04:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
dispersing that money not out not in the
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
same manner that the state disperses the
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
money to the municipalities so there was
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
agreement that we should use the same
 
04:56:32.590 --> 04:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
process the same formula as the state
 
04:56:36.670 --> 04:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
sends money to the to the municipalities
 
04:56:39.788 --> 04:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
from this municipality havil to the fire
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
district Woodsville there was agreement
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
now there was no agreement in regard to
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
some of the other issues but I know and
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
you know that the first time you sit
 
04:56:52.990 --> 04:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
down at a meeting you have to really
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
work hard roll the sleeves up and it
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
takes a while to get there it took us a
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
long time to get there in regard to
 
04:57:02.110 --> 04:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
having the whole town take ownership and
 
04:57:03.990 --> 04:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
how we fund our fire departments but we
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
did that now that we're in the fire
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
department business and and going that
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
direction the only reason why
 
04:57:15.548 --> 04:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
primarily havil corner has opted to join
 
04:57:18.030 --> 04:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the town fire department which
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
consists only of North havil is that the
 
04:57:22.750 --> 04:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
fun money that was supporting our fire
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
department came down from everybody
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
raising revenue in this town through the
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
to through the town well with the threat
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we may not receive that money
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the the 190 some odd people in
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
hail Corner said well we we we'll we'll
 
04:57:40.868 --> 04:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
join that department they did by a very
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
vote so there this there are issues that
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
we need to look at it takes time for
 
04:57:51.628 --> 04:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
change um but the plan to move forward
 
04:57:55.230 --> 04:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
wood roads what is the plan immediately
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
following when the town takes over the
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
Woodsville roads what happens to the
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
labor force within Woodsville what about
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
their benefits what about their
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
retirement how are they going to be
 
04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
taken care of is there any guarantee
 
04:58:08.590 --> 04:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to still be there what
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
happens in terms of the a long range
 
04:58:13.868 --> 04:58:13.878 align:start position:0%
plan in terms of the the maintenance of
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
all the other issues water department in
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
in in Woodsville what happens to the
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
Sewer that comes from North havil down
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
into uh uh Woodsville where it's treated
 
04:58:26.948 --> 04:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
and and taken care of there uh I think
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
the folks in Woodsville as the people in
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
havil corner were looking for yes we
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
want to we want to work towards all
 
04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
being one town working together and
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
which we try to do but we need to see
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
how's that going to impact our our local
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
expenses our assets our revenues and if
 
04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
that can be all laid out then people are
 
04:58:51.150 --> 04:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down and talk I don't
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
believe that's all been laid out to the
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire
 
04:58:58.830 --> 04:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
district this is a very divisive issue
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
and there is litigation going on right
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
now which is a shame that each of us in
 
04:59:04.590 --> 04:59:04.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and the rest of the town are
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
having to use our local revenues to
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
fight each other this has to stop uh it
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
just cannot continue in regard to the
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
audit I have spoken with the manager
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's been recently hired who comes
 
04:59:21.628 --> 04:59:21.638 align:start position:0%
back comes to us from industry here in
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and has a good
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
understanding how to manage how to
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
administrate uh units such as the
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville uh departments which have
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
been now merged into one Under One Roof
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
which he manages and there the first
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
several years yes errors have been found
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
they found found errors in other areas a
 
04:59:43.628 --> 04:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
haal when we had our audits done for our
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
annual audit they found errors in ponts
 
04:59:48.510 --> 04:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
too which permont went through a
 
04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
disastrous time several years back so
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
these things happen but it's not
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
fraudulent and nothing has been proven
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be fraudulent in the audit the audit
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
should be done sometime later this
 
05:00:06.548 --> 05:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
summer and I think it's very premature
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
to be acting on a bill such as this
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
without having a good strong knowledge
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
of what that audit has netted us and we
 
05:00:17.310 --> 05:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't have that yet so I I'm not
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill I think the bill
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
has a lot of areas which um need really
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
a good stiff look at um there's areas in
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
which the distribution formula was
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
agreed by all in the community and by
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
that I mean all those that lived in
 
05:00:39.150 --> 05:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
havil and it's um it's it's worked uh
 
05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
now there might be some disagreement as
 
05:00:43.628 --> 05:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
to what is the definition of a net
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget versus the highway
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget that could be easily
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
easily resolved by just putting
 
05:00:51.750 --> 05:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
definition into the
 
05:00:54.910 --> 05:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
statute also it could be made you know a
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute could be a amended somewhere
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
along the way I don't know if this is
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
the time to do it perhaps not but a a
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
statute could be amended stating that
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
any future changes are may be done by
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
the two boards the Commissioners and and
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
the select board working to together
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
without having to have the approval of
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
the general court there's a lot of
 
05:01:18.750 --> 05:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
things that can be done here and that is
 
05:01:21.070 --> 05:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
why we need to really take some time
 
05:01:24.190 --> 05:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
here and I urge this committee to take
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
some time in looking at this this has
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
been highly contentious down in in the
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
community we've had this before when it
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
came to our schools folks in hail Corner
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
didn't like the idea of taking hail
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
Academy out of hail corner and taking
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
High School up to Woodsville so it's
 
05:01:43.390 --> 05:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
nothing new we sort of got getting out
 
05:01:45.948 --> 05:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
of that old cultural thinking and we're
 
05:01:48.270 --> 05:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
becoming a town in terms of our schools
 
05:01:50.350 --> 05:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
hail is an old Community much like
 
05:01:52.750 --> 05:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
Conway used to be with their precincts
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
we're getting there we're moving there
 
05:01:58.670 --> 05:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
but we have to move there with uh uh
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
with foresight and with a good look at
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be five to 10 years
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
down the road we want to move to
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
something that's going to not cost us
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
out of the business we want to move Pro
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
that we have something that's more
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
efficient and we need to work there
 
05:02:16.510 --> 05:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
together so we all have ownership in it
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
right now by the state making a decision
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
issue we're we're just mandating pil
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
this is how things will happen there's
 
05:02:28.548 --> 05:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
no ownership that's going to come about
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
that and we really run the risk of
 
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
having one Precinct trying to become
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
municipality article 24 in 2020 which
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
was on our town
 
05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
report asked the voters whether they
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to take over ownership of the
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
highway system in
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
Woodsville contingent upon the
 
05:02:51.878 --> 05:02:53.190 align:start position:0%
Woodsville contingent upon the
Woodsville

05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
Woodsville
 
05:02:53.200 --> 05:02:54.830 align:start position:0%
Woodsville
residents

05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
residents
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
agreeing when it went to the Woodsville
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
residents for the agreement the vote was
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
52 to Zer not to join havil at this
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
time there was no plan paralleling that
 
05:03:11.948 --> 05:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
request or that article so in conclusion
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
I know I've talked quite a bit here I'm
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions but I urge you

05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
name is Jam just talk a little bit about
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
the audit of what you know and I'm going
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
to preface this all by a request that
 
05:04:26.190 --> 05:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
you send whatever parts of the completed
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
a audit you can to members of the
 
05:04:32.910 --> 05:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay well we uh certainly
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
first thank you for uh entertaining me
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
and allowing me to speak on this
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
important legislation
 
05:04:41.670 --> 05:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh there are there are you know two
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the legislation I'm not going
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
to comment as the Dr takes no position
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
on the first part of the
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the the second part of
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation is really what we care
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
about and it is really because
 
05:04:59.070 --> 05:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
RSA uh 41 31a states that Financial
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
audits play a fundamentally vital role
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
in helping to preserve the Integrity of
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
the Public Finance functions by
 
05:05:08.190 --> 05:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining citizens confidence in their
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
elected leaders uh properly performed
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
audits provide independent assurance
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
that financial information presented is
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
reliable because of this New Hampshire
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
law mandates that all municipalities
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
with populations of greater than 750
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
conduct an annual audit now over the
 
05:05:28.990 --> 05:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
last 20 years the wizville fire district
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
attempted to complete just one audit and
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
05:05:35.070 --> 05:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
2014 that audit was not completed
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
because officials in the district
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
refused to turn over the necessary
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
documents over a dispute about
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh since 2014 the
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
district elected numerous Auditors and
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
made statements both to the public and
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
to the Dr that they had audited
 
05:05:55.390 --> 05:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
financials however after we investigated
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
the situation we realized that the
 
05:05:59.948 --> 05:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
locally elected auditor never actually
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
performed an audit and the audited
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
financial statements they claimed to
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
have were nothing more than unaudited
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
financial statements the first time we
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually saw a movement toward
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
completing an audit was when s SP 414
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
was introduced last year this bill which
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
passed the House and Senate impos the
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
same penalties that this bill does for
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
not completing their audits in a timely
 
05:06:24.868 --> 05:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
fashion as a result of the pressure put
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the district in 2020 they engaged The
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
Firm of plazak and Sanderson to complete
 
05:06:31.830 --> 05:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
at least five years of audits to date
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
they have completed three of these
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
audits these audits reveal numerous
 
05:06:39.070 --> 05:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
violations of State statutes these
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
include violations of RSA 32 the
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law RSA 33 the
 
05:06:47.310 --> 05:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
municipal Finance act an additional
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
violations of RSA
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
41 uh some of the potential violations
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
or violations actually include taking
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
out loans without first getting approval
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
from the voters under New Hampshire LW
 
05:07:01.548 --> 05:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to get 60% approval from
 
05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
the voters uh they took out loans
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
without getting any support from the
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
electorate filing incomplete or
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
misleading forms with the Dr that
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
concealed these loans and making risky
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
Investments that are contrary to state
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
law the Dr is in the process of further
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
investigating these potential
 
05:07:23.708 --> 05:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
violations um uh this includes
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
co-mingling of funds the audits also uh
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
detail concerns that are not under the
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
purview of the Dr one such example which
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
has been talked about was a district
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
falsely reporting to the New Hampshire
 
05:07:39.190 --> 05:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system over an 11-year period
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
of about an employee that they had misc
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
Mis Mis categorized in addition to the
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
numerous violations of State statutes
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
the audit detailed how the district had
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
no meaningful internal controls in place
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that would help minimize the risk of
 
05:07:56.190 --> 05:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
fraud or human error in fact the audit
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
States the following based upon the
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
results of the audit procedures and
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
observations made during the audit we
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
noted the district has a lack of
 
05:08:07.150 --> 05:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
internal control and Direction regarding
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
the accounting system and overall fiscal
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
mismanagement uh we have significant
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that without the passage of
 
05:08:18.190 --> 05:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 26 the district will have
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
little incentive to complete the two
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
years of remaining audits we believe the
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
potential penalties
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
imposed uh by last year's SB 414 is what
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
forced Woodsville Water and Light hand
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
and in in 20120 and without that the
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
three years of audits we now have would
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
not have been completed therefore the Dr
 
05:08:40.510 --> 05:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
believes is in par if those penalties
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
contained in s sp26 are enacted if the
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
legislature Wishes the Dr to have a
 
05:08:47.470 --> 05:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful and effective way to enforce
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with RSA 4131 a and just on a
 
05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
on a final note um I'm I'm I'm assuming
 
05:08:58.390 --> 05:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
I misheard uh a couple of speakers
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
because I believe they said there was
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way there was any
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
comingling of funds and the audit showed
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
that uh where of course on I'm looking
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
at page 46 of and I just grabbed the
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
2016 audit uh under the non-compliance
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
with State statutes payment in L of
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
taxes Pro from proprietary fund
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
surpluses we identified three transfers
 
05:09:23.040 --> 05:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
surpluses we identified three transfers
of

05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
$15,000 each made from accumulated fund
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
balances of water fund electric fund and
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
Sewer fund to the district's general
 
05:09:34.510 --> 05:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
fund as a payment Al of taxes these
 
05:09:36.990 --> 05:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
transfers were made contrary to the
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
provision of RSA 30 8 29 water funds and
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 14910 sewer fund what those statutes
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
with those RSA do is prevent the co-
 
05:09:49.708 --> 05:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
mangling of funds which their own
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
Auditors said they did so again I must
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
have misheard them when they said there
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't that was not going on um I will
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
now uh certainly open up for any
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
have I do
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
have those audits
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
online or or
 
05:10:11.548 --> 05:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
not uh I don't believe we we the Dr does
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
not audits online we do not have those
 
05:10:16.150 --> 05:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
audits online but they are publicly
 
05:10:19.708 --> 05:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
available and If you could you send you
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
the three years of audits that I have to
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
you sir if if you
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
could send them to me as chairman and
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
you can find my my email and any member
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
who wants it I can forward it on for you
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that for some of us um
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
three large volumes of
 
05:10:48.510 --> 05:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
audits but I can get them out two people
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
I think that some of us are going to
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
want to look at them before we make it
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.230 --> 05:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:06.510 --> 05:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh Thompson thank you Mr
 
05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Gary do you
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
um does the Dr determine whether any of
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
these or is it your purview to determine
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
whether any of these issues of are
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
criminal or just uh a lack of knowledge
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
on on
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
the part of the people who uh put
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
positions yeah thank you thank you for
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
your question uh we only determine
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
what uh violates the laws that we deal
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
with which is mainly the municipal
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
budget act the municipal Finance act and
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
say 41 we do not assign criminality to
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
that that would be uh the Department of
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
Justice that would would handle that
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
that is not something the Dr is involved
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
with thank you any further
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
questions see thank you very much for

minutes Mr chairman you you were blocked

briefly thank you Mr chairman and I
 
05:12:55.070 --> 05:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh the Indulgence very
 
05:12:57.708 --> 05:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
quickly here you are as a State
 
05:12:57.718 --> 05:12:59.390 align:start position:0%
quickly here you are as a State
Legislative

05:12:59.390 --> 05:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
Legislative
 
05:13:02.910 --> 05:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay digging into details of
 
05:13:05.070 --> 05:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
what is clearly a local
 
05:13:07.470 --> 05:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
matter and the point I'm trying to make
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
and asking you to support
 
05:13:11.310 --> 05:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
26 is this is not where this committee
 
05:13:16.110 --> 05:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
belongs this is not a state issue of
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
funding it's not a state issue of
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
Transportation or Public
 
05:13:23.190 --> 05:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
Works the legislature has no place here
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
passing this law will harm nothing it
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
will in fact facilitate moving
 
05:13:32.548 --> 05:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
forward because at that point there will
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
be no state law preempting the ability
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
of local agencies to move forward and
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
having to bring this before a state
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislature whose Duties are to the
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
state and not to the if you will uh
 
05:13:49.470 --> 05:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
assessing uh funding requirements on
 
05:13:51.310 --> 05:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
local communities for the sake of other
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
local communities so with great respect
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the duties that you fulfill in
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
covering our state's
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
highways this is a law that needs to go
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
away so that the problem can in fact be
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
solved in the words of Representative
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
lad been dealing with this since
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
2004 trying to change it can't happen
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
trying to change or alter that
 
05:14:14.590 --> 05:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
relationship cannot happen with this
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
Statute in place as it is hence the
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
origin of Senate Bill 26 the passage of
 
05:14:22.350 --> 05:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
which will in fact enable the
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
communities to work forward
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
constructively with no blockade
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
chairman yes thank you Mr thank you
 
05:14:36.670 --> 05:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
Senator um you said that there really is
 
05:14:39.750 --> 05:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
no role for the state here but
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard was that
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh a source of the conflict is how State
 
05:14:49.628 --> 05:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
Highway fund re Revenue sharing to to
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
haal get split up among the different
 
05:14:55.150 --> 05:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
towns and different precincts and um
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
that does seem to be a state issue and
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that we've certainly
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with in this committee uh you know
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
the the local tax portion of
 
05:15:07.390 --> 05:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
it I I think it's just a wash I mean if
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
U if ha wants to take their money and
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
Ville takes their money then you know
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's how this Village uh
 
05:15:17.788 --> 05:15:17.798 align:start position:0%
Precinct system
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
works uh really is no change there the
 
05:15:21.310 --> 05:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
only change is how how they deal with
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the money that comes from the state with
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
all due respect representative um that
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
is not correct the highway block grant
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
money is in fact distributed fully in
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
accord with state law the percentages
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
based on population and so forth mileage
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
there is no change that this in no way
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
impact the distribution of block grant
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
this bill only impacts and requires
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
raising and appropriating local funds by
 
05:15:48.590 --> 05:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
one community and requiring by state law
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
that those funds be given to another
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
community so there's no impact
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on the highway block grants
 
05:15:54.798 --> 05:15:56.110 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on the highway block grants
thank

05:15:56.110 --> 05:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
Senator I have no other hands rais for
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
anybody wishing to speak um I will close
 
05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
on Senate
 
05:16:14.948 --> 05:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
Bill six
 
05:16:17.708 --> 05:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
um thank everybody for sticking around
 
05:16:19.470 --> 05:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
for two hours of
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
testimony as as many of you know I had
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
hoped to exec this bill
 
05:16:28.548 --> 05:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
today however given the fact that I have
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
asked for the audit to forwarded to us
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
um J bercher had a lot of Statistics she
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
was going to send us uh Mr PL and Mr
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
Shelton both had said they were GNA send
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
their written testimony I think that we
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
need to take some time look through all
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
of this information before we make a
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
final decision rather than jump into it
 
05:17:00.030 --> 05:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
today um I know some of us are probably
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
ready to to say let's finish this and
 
05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
get it over with but I think we need to
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
do it right um our
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
um executive session on this bill will
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
be on the 19 Wednesday the 19th of
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
May we'll be in the hybrid uh
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
situation um I will work with the uh
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
ranking member on a good time whether
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's morning or afternoon and we'll talk
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
about that I just asking um so I think
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
that it will behoove all of us to look
 
05:17:40.030 --> 05:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
through all all of the information we
 
05:17:42.670 --> 05:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
already have look through some of the
 
05:17:45.030 --> 05:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
history and look through the information
 
05:17:46.110 --> 05:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
forthcoming I I think that in order to
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
do that we'll come to the right decision
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
and again we will have four choices you
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
know pass it kill it amend it or retain
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
it and work on it for the next few weeks
 
05:18:07.150 --> 05:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
few months so that those are the options
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
that we will look at on the night
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
um representative Evil's hand is always
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
oh um I wondered if representative lad
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
could share the research that he had OSS
 
05:18:23.310 --> 05:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
do for him on the legislative
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
history um you can find his email and
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
ask him for it okay I okay I'm not sure
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
he's still here I see I see it I see him
 
05:18:35.190 --> 05:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing is I just was
 
05:18:37.470 --> 05:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what the litigation
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
was and maybe he can tell tell us about
 
05:18:39.440 --> 05:18:40.510 align:start position:0%
was and maybe he can tell tell us about
that

05:18:40.510 --> 05:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:43.390 --> 05:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
too representative lad did you hear the
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
request yes I did uh representative
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
Graham um yes I do have the uh
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
communication I got from Benoy peler I
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
will forward that on to you Mr chairman
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
you can distribute it to your
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee um also in regard to
 
05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
litigation uh I I'm not really part of
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
this anymore however I can tell you that
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's sizable amount of dollar that's
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
being spent by both part parties on this
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
and of
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
course we finished the hearing on this
 
05:19:16.510 --> 05:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
fill so I don't want to get too much
 
05:19:21.310 --> 05:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
depth on things that were said in the uh
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the hearing and because we're not in
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
executive session either so we're kind
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
of outside the Realms of our our
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
boundaries here of what we should or
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
doing but the request for the U
 
05:19:43.708 --> 05:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:43.718 --> 05:19:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
legitimate

05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
any else from any members of the
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
committee on what the way forward is
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is one thing representative I
 
05:19:55.708 --> 05:19:55.718 align:start position:0%
hardly concur with your decision I think
 
05:19:58.270 --> 05:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
we need to take our time on this this I
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't want I don't think I'd
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
make a good decision today if I had to
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
vote why our decisions are
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
always yeah I I'm just speaking for
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
myself I I
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
but I think that there's a lot of head
 
05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
shaking I think a lot of people want to
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
look at um do our due diligence and make
 
05:20:20.110 --> 05:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
sure we we've come to the right decision
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
um and another two weeks isn't going to
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
kill um whatever there is for for this
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill or black
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
there any other questions from members
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee to me about the way
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward um I as I said in my last email
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%

05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%

05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
