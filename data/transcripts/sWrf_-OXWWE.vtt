Timothy Horgan from um straford County
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is the town of Durham
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
and um I uh I'm pleased to be here I
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
didn't think I was going to be able to
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
make today and so I I thank
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative both representative
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
howand and Howard and Howland who are um
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
also um were ready to ready to step in
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
so I thank them for for coming over and
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're like uh they're both like after
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
me in the alphabetical order on the
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
roster of uh State reps but anyway so
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony I handed it out and
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh basically it's pretty simple
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
currently municipalities and school
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
districts are at least in theory
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
forbidden to celebrate any special day
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
Which con conflicts with official
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
holidays so this law you know in my
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
opinion is an overreach which violates
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
the principle of local control and I
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
actually like Drew up a uh list of them
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
and how they're how they're designated
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
New Year's Day Martin Luther um and I
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
also although ironically in the list I
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
rather hurriedly so I forgot to leave
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
out the for Columbus Day I forgot to
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
leave out the part about how it's
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
determined that's probably the most
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
controversial one that's the second
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
Monday in October but just about all
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
those days uh all those days conflict
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
with some other uh some some some other
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
other observant
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
so communi should be free to observe
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
whatever holidays they please and
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with celebrating
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions on the same day and
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes renaming a holiday is okay too
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
so I know um I think I think what
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
prompted is is uh several communities
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
including mine um prefer to observe
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day on um the second
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
Monday in October and that's uh that's
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to any any any other
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
ethnic group Columbus was a
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
controversial historical figure but uh
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
he has become his the day of his voyage
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
is a uh associate both with Italian
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
Americans and then not so much in the
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
English speaking world not so much
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
outside and outside America the Spanish

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition of uh HB
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
139 um in early
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
2024 the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
passed and Governor sonunu signed the
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
extremely bipartisan House Bill
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
1014 this bill contained two significant
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
sections the first section required
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
school public schools in their civic
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
classes to teach about election laws and
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
voting the second section seeks to make
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
the naming of holidays uniform
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in all cities towns
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities and public
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
schools it
 
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
requires um not in theory that any
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
municipality or school that has a
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
holiday following or falling on a date
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
specified in state law uh which is RS
 
00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
specified in state law uh which is RS
say

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
288.15

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
288.15
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
one holidays the same throughout the
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now I'm not a legal scholar
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
but I also believe
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
that this follows the Dillan law form of
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
government that New Hampshire
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
has traditional holidays carry deep
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and emotional
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
significance that connects generations
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
of people and fosters a sense of shared
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
Unity preserving these holidays is vital
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
to naming the cultural heritage to
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me to maintaining the cultural
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
heritage and communal values uh they
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
embody changing or modernizing in
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
traditional holidays creates confusion
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
with no real benefit to
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
anyone hb14 memorializes our state's
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
proud tradition of recognizing cultural
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
heritage noteworthy events and
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
historical figures maintaining
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
traditional holiday names throughout the
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
state throughout all local and state
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
agencies ensures that future Generations
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
understand and appreciate the origins of
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
these celebrations
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
HB 1014 does not require a municipality
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
or school to declare a holiday on the
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
that have a local holiday on one of the
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
RSA 2881 named holidays must call it
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
specifically what the state requires
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
nothing more nothing less for example a
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
in January other anything other than
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King Day excuse me Martin
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
Luther King Jr Civil Rights Day a town
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
could also have a holiday on December
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
25th and call a Christmas day but cannot
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%

question thank you and thank you for
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my question is uh
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
more focused on the
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
education impact of these holidays I
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
know you talked about the different uh
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh holidays but as it affects those in
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
school uh and the fact that U missing
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
school is a can be accumulative serious
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
impact is there anything in this
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
language or this law that that uh is
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
being proposed that would make up so for
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
example if you had took
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day as a holiday is
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
there anything that says well if the
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
municipality or the school board picks
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
that as a holiday that they have to have
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
a makeup educational day the next week
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
or the next month or whatever do you
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
know anything in there I I do not know
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
anything representative um I think
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually that the way the current law is
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
structured um by mandating what scho
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
schools and municipalities call holidays
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
um teaches them proper Civics this is a
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
Dylan rural state if I recall um it
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
teaches them also and um uh to um um to
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
be able to understand how um uh history
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
Etc if the municipalities wish to have a
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
separate day you mentioned indigenous
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
peoples days as an example nothing in
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
this law stops them from doing
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
it the the as I understand the current
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
law it does it just requires them if
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to have um a a a holiday
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
on Monday in October whenever it is
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
it'll be called Columbus Day I think
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's the second Monday maybe your third
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
Monday in October um but they can call
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's they I believe the
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
United Nations has calls has a um um a a
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
holiday entitled um indigenous people's
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
day which is different than Columbus Day
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
Howland welcome back to Municipal and
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
County government representative thank
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
you um I'm Al Holland I represent
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
straford 20 which is Durham Lee Madbury
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
and a sliver of do do Ward 4 um and I'm
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of the bill um I was
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
on the durm Town Council in 2017 when we
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
changed Columbus Day to indigenous
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
people's day and I was also on the
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
oyster for school board in 2018 when we
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
followed suit um that came after a
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
couple of years of
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
community questioning a painting that
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is in our uh our local uh post
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
office and it really speaks to the
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
Oyster River raid which occurred in 1690
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
when the French uh working with the
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
abanaki attacked the Garrison on the
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
Oyster River it resulted in 104 deaths
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
and 21 captives it is probably one of
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
the most significant uh historical
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
events in Durham and really significant
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of New Hampshire in US history
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
and we really felt that uh while you
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
know Columbus really did have and and
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
all of the uh the ex the uh the
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
explorers that came from Europe really
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
had an impact that this really to our
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
community was significant and so we we
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
decided to change it uh to indigenous
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
people day I support this because what
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
happened was uh a couple of years ago
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
there was legislation that came that
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
really tried to force all municipalities
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
to do indigenous people day this took
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
the 180 which is to try to force all
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
municipal ities to do Columbus Day we
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
really wanted to restore local control
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
there has been no evidence that any of
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
the other dates have been changed by any
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
municipality it's only a minority that
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
occurred that was uh indigenous people
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
day this would restore their right it
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
would not take away any other
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh right to do Columbus
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
Day that would really be up to them and
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's up to their voters and I can tell
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
you it is a long and painful process to
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
change the a uh one of these dates and
 
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.029 align:start position:0%
change the a uh one of these dates and
so

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're just asking you to allow us to go
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
back to what we did before we just think
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
that this we don't think that the state
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
should mandate it we think it should be
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
local control and I think that came
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
under two
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you representative Holland
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions repes the chair recognizes
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative mat majori thank you
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative and welcome back I I was
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
hoping you would speak because maybe you
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
can uh I think you might have some
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
familiarity with my question uh I've
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
negotiated many of the collective
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements in my community
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the components of most
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements is
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
major holidays do you think this bill in
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
any way would have an effect on the
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
major holiday uh piece of a collective
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement if those collective
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements might extend uh
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
might be expansive well actually it
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
already did because um the collective
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements that were
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
multi-year agreements that that were in
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
place in 2024 if we had negotiated them
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
before uh the new bill last year took
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
place the language in our collective
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement said indigenous
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
people day uh and so when the state
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
changed it it it really threw off our
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
our already negotiated agreements I
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
think that's fairly easily amended
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
either way as I say I I think um I think
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was why don't you
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
add another day and it's exactly because
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
of that these are kind of mandated
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
holidays in both schools and
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities we didn't want to add a
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
day because it add cost we just wanted
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative next the chair calls
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%

representative Susan pelli Rockingham
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
District 19 Hampton Falls and Kensington
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
I oppose hb1
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
139 this bill seeks to remove the common
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
sense requirement that educational
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
institutions and municipalities use a
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
holidays legal title in Communications
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
Publications and documents our New
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal holidays the names are
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in chapter 288 RSA 288
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
colon 1 why is this provision to use our
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
legal holiday name so important because
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
we must remember to honor our current
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
holidays holidays reflect our shared
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
history why do we celebrate or
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
commemorate holidays these special days
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
are designed to remember our shared
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
experiences these special days have a
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
significant place in history and schools
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
and mun or municipalities may be closed
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
to reflect this
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
importance the current law just passed
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
last term is very simple it simply s
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
states that schools and municipalities
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
use the legal name for state holidays
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
unofficial Communications like calendars
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
and documents for example we don't want
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day to be renamed
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily and we don't want Christmas
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
day to be randomly named for example
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
winter solstice day this would cause
 
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
winter solstice day this would cause
significant

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
confusion we have a wellestablished
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
process to add or change legal holidays
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
and names and I welcome and encourage
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
everyone to go through the process that
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
we're going through today let's honor
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
our current legal holiday names by UniFi
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
by unifying and sharing our holiday
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
traditions by respecting the current
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
legal holiday names used by schools or
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities I respectfully request an
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%

current law um as it sits that allows
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
for a municipality to use two names in
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%

Rockingham District 5 the town of

eping and it is my pleasure to introduce
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
to you this morning House Bill 346 FN a
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
Bill all it does is
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
increase the fee that municipalities can
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
assess on
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
racetracks in order to license those
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
facilities that's all the bill does
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
makes no other changes to
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
statute why do we allow towns to license
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
racetracks they're just business
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
businesses after all like a pet store or
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
a bakery we don't force those people to
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
get a
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
license well we license racetracks
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
because there is a public safety public
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety component to the
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
operation of a
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
racetrack we want to make sure that
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
people who attend races are protected
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
and kept safe in the process so the
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
legisl passed Back in 1970 a bill to
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to license
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
racetracks they set in statute at that
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
time a fee of
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
$100 up to
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
$100 uh for the lenser of a racetrack in
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
today's dollars that $100 would be
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
$710 95
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
cents just adjusting for inflation and
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
so why did i s pick $500 as the the new
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
value for allowing the license licensure
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
racetrack I chose that number because
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty conservative when it comes to
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
spending other per people's money it may
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
not be be the right number but I trust
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
that the members of this committee will
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what the right number
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
is if they deem it's worthy of
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the fee at all and My Town
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
Administrator Mr Jake Roger will explain
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
shortly why the two of us believe that
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
necessary so with no further Ado I'd
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
like to have Mr Roger explain just what
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
goes in to creating and a license for a
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
racetrack by the way eping has two
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
racetracks the New England Dragway and
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
the Star
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
Speedway and I can assure you that
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
particularly when the New England
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
Dragway has a national event the impact
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
on the town of eping
 
00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:18.589 align:start position:0%
on the town of eping
is

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
epic the traffic flows uh the number of
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
people who come to eeping for one of
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
those events is huge
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to turn it over now to Mr
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
Roger to explain to you how we go about
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that those two racetracks
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
are safe for the general
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
public thank thank you representative V
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh as stated my name is Jake Roger Town
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
Administrator here uh or down in eping
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to represent our govering
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
body the select board um and they
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh I would do a quick correction uh
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
which I I won't fault you but we have
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
three tracks in town now we have a new
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
one it's MX 101 motocross track so
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that kind of
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
triggered this is okay now we're talking
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of work that we put in for for all
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
three of them to inspect and
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
everything um so I I made a quick
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I'm happy to share either by
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
email or have some copies mailed of each
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
staff member and then their involvement
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
and how many hours I broke it down down
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
to how many hours they spend on issuing
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
one license to One
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
Racetrack so we have our town planner
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
who inspects the track for violations of
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
our zoning ordinance we have our fire
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
prevention officer which is the most
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
significant it's about 6 hours per track
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh she performs inspection prior to
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
opening day inspects all the satellite
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
concession locations Hospitality tents
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
trailers uh our fire chief discusses the
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
emergency action plan with the tracks
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
and forms a memorandum of understanding
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
in with each separate
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
track our executive secretary prepares
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
documents for the select board meeting
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
issues the actual license posts all the
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
public hearings in information on the
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
town website and at the Town Hall things
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
like that our health inspector inspects
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
all the stands Food Services things like
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
that and then answers calls or
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
complaints our police chief reviews and
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
signs the
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
application uh and kind of plans out the
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
details cuz often they need police
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
details and then I review their proposed
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
schedules confer with track officials
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
and explain the schedule to the board
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
before they approve it each
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
year so um so I added up the the total
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
cost including benefits so I took their
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
hourly rate including benefits because
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's the true cost to the town and all
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
that came out to about
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
$698 that it costs us to issue one
 
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.630 align:start position:0%
$698 that it costs us to issue one
license

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
so if we're charging $100 it's around
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
$598 that really our taxpayers are
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
footing the bill for that difference so
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
now that we're up to three tracks you
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
know it begins to add up more than
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
$1,500 that really are our taxpayers are
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
paying for us to spend all that time
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
with each
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
track so that's really what it comes
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
down to uh we're re we're making a lot
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
of changes to our racetrack bylaws I end
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
up digging in into them a lot because we
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
have three in town and that's why I
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
noticed that uh that the rate in this
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
statute seemed low and brought it
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
forward and I think that's all like I
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
said I'm happy to share this with anyone
 
00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.470 align:start position:0%
said I'm happy to share this with anyone
who's

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
interested thank you I'm not a racing
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
fan myself so that's why I didn't know
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
about the third racetrack I don't follow
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
that real closely
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
but uh so that's our presentation and
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions uh
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you are there
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair uh the
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
question I had was in regards I know
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
you're stating you have several hours
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you're tied up in are there other
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
types of businesses that have
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
entertainment value in your community
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
also have this type of situation
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
with not particularly the first thing
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is our large assembly
 
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.030 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is our large assembly
permit

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
which also has a fee which I can't
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of my head but that
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
goes through a similar process it's
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
usually a lot quicker just police fire
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
public works if they're closing a road
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
but it's a similar process but
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
definitely not as many
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
hours yeah so for example uh on
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
Halloween we shut down Main Street or a
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
block of Main Street and have a hallowen
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
party that the entire town comes to it's
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
a it's a fairly big significant event
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
and um that's the kind of assembly that
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
license followup followup what what type
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
of fee do you charge for those
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
assemblies because again it sounds like
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
you have safety concerns with those
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
types of events as well right that's why
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
I was saying I don't I believe it's $100
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
but I can't promise you that I could get
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr Roger would you
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
be able to um obtain that that
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
information and and email it to the
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee or have representative o
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman thank
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
my question and I will tell you that uh
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
in exiter if the wind's blowing right I
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
do hear the New England Dragway um my
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
question is the difference between the
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
town uh celebration of Halloween where
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
he shut down uh Main Street and a
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
private entity of the
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
Dragway um do you see that there should
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
two well they're obviously different
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
events but they both have public health
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
and safety concerns and the purpose of a
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
license is to make sure that those
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
concerns are
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
addressed and I would just say some of
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
the um Dragway events are you know 5 to
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
10 ,000 people so it's a lot more
 
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
10 ,000 people so it's a lot more
significant

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
event further questions representative
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam chair for taking
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
my question uh and thank you for being
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
here before the committee my question is
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
year overy year how often do some of
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
change plans meaning um uh like your
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
emergency plan your fire
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
plan um need for police details are
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
there variations or big changes that are
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
made I wouldn't say big changes and
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's why so the the fire chief dealing
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
with that he got he said he takes about
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
one hour per track that wasn't a a big
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
part of it is those emergency plans but
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
drive over to the track meet with the
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
officials maybe one line and change a
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
couple items in the document but no
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
nothing significant and drive back okay
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
followup yes um in terms of inspecting
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
your food stands uh the health inspector
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
does this and my question is do the
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
people who run the food stands require
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
any sort of License
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
to um to vend at these events and if so
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
what is the cost for that license I'd
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to research that information I
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
believe they obtain a permit from the
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
state but I'd have to research the cost
 
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.430 align:start position:0%
state but I'd have to research the cost
to

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
that additional questions representative
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman and
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen uh for being here
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
and for testifying get ready for golf um
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh my question is statement and question
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
that the longer I've been here the the
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
the more I get concerned about having to
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
revisit bill bills that have a hard
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
number I understand why we have to have
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
a hard number is there any reason why
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
the number or or the language couldn't
 
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
be actual costs rather than a hard
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
number because we're just going to have
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
to come back and revisit 500 again or a
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
not to exceed number could the language
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
say actual cost to the community or
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
something of the like in your
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
opinion that's a good question and I
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
would trust the committee's Judgment as
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
to the proper way to set into statute
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
what the fee should be I would guard
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
against however letting it
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
be up to the committee to the community
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
or the municipality to decide that
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
because we could end up with widely
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
varying charges you know Lee could
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
charge $10,000 for a license while eing
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
charges maybe 1,000 or whatever the the
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
number number might be so I would I
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just let the communi set that
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
number but certainly it doesn't have to
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
be a hard number in statute it could be
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
um adjusted by the annual CPI the rate
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
of inflation or something like that
 
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.630 align:start position:0%
of inflation or something like that
thank

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question my question
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
is is it true that a
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
municipality publishes the fee schedule
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
for for these sorts of things so that
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's publicly known and understood what
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
the fees for different licenses or
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
permits are I can't think of a statute
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
or anything that requires us to do that
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
but we do post all of our ordinances on
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
our website and our ordinance States the
 
00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:23.630 align:start position:0%
our website and our ordinance States the
the

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
fee any other questions seeing none
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
bzowski did I get that name right yes
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
good welcome to Municipal and County
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
Government thank you um my name is Ben
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
bzowski I am the owner and operator of
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
Hudson Speedway Lee USA Speedway in
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
clont Motorsports Park um when I heard
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
about this uh bill being proposed I was
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
kind of shocked I was wondering
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
why why you wanted to raise it so high
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
where our expenses for these racetracks
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
are growing exponentially every year uh
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
between um you know food costs uh you
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
know the bill for the police department
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
fire department to show up ambulance and
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
all this other stuff um and I was just I
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
was just kind of wondering
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
why it hasn't changed since
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
1970 uh we do all of our you know for
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
the inspections we keep everything up to
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
code we make sure I actually you go a
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
little above and beyond um just because
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
like I said Public Safety for me is
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
number one um I I like I said I'm I'm
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
not very good public speaking so I'm
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
sorry if I'm trembling or whatever um
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
but I I just we're already restricted as
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
it is we can only run I'll use Hudson as
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
example I can only run Sundays and
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
holidays for five hours and I can only
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
do that for 15 days so when everyone
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
else can work 365 days a year and can
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
work eight hours to pay their bills and
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
support their family and stuff I only
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
have five hours every Sunday and that's
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
not pertaining if weather hits or um you
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
know sometimes I I don't have staff
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes so sometimes I'm short staffed
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
on a lot of stuff so sometimes I have to
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
cancel the show um and I'll use Lee as
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
example so uh lee Le beway is my is the
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
biggest track that I have um they
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
require me to have six firefighters with
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
a fir
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
truck uh roughly
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's four
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
officers and an ambulance system there
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that's only for eight hours and I
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
run 14 times a year on that so I know
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
500 doesn't seem like a lot to people
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
but for people like me you know timesing
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
it by five is a lot for you know just a
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
small track owner so like I said I just
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
I was just very shocked on this and
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's really all I have to say
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
you for testifying thank you for taking
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
my question and you're a very good
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
public speaker by the way thank you um
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
you you stated in your testimony that
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
all of your costs have increased M as
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
you in your many years in this
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
business do you understand that the
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
towns at costs have increase as well I I
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
agree but the problem is I'm restricted
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
to time that I the town only allows me
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
to run to pay that back so you know it
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to up at 500 but
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
let me run more times to offset the cost
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
of that then i' I'd be fine with that
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
but the town only allows me to I'll use
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hudson as an example I'm only allowed to
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
run Sundays for five hours and
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
holidays and I and you know I can only
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
run on you know I can't run every
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
holiday I want to spend time with my
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
family too but that's that's other than
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
that but it just we're restricted to so
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
much we're only restricted to narrow
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
window to pay for our bills so it just I
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
me the chair recognizes representative
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
frock for a question thank you madam
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%

racetracks yes we do followup please yes

and has your admission price been
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
constant since I'm going to say
 
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.950 align:start position:0%
constant since I'm going to say
[Music]

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
1972 uh I don't know what they charged
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
back in the day but I'm pretty sure
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hudson has always been 15 bucks to get
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
into the uh the
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
gate thank
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
questions I have a oh I'm sorry
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Mr Bowski I know
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
you um are talking about three different
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
facilities other than what eping has
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
what kind
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
of how often does the local fire
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
department police department come for
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
inspections at the other three year
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
three facilities uh they come once a
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
beginning followup yes about how much
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
time do you feel they are there with you
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
at that time um each track's a little
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.150 align:start position:0%
at that time um each track's a little
different

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh Hudson is maybe an hour if that uh
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
Lee's a little more probably
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
two uh in Claremont I'd have to get my
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
general manager because he's the one
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
there there because I'm two hours away
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm pretty sure I I can't see that
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
being any more than an hour and a half
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
for that for Claremont thank
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
you additional
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gerard asked
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
the question that I was going to ask so
 
00:50:27.079 --> 00:50:29.030 align:start position:0%
the question that I was going to ask so
thank

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
you okay um seeing no further questions
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing your testimony
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
jro welcome to Municipal and County
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
giving us the opportunity to speak thank
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
you for the representatives to attend
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
the meeting the hearing today um I don't
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
know what went on prior to this because
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
through some research I was doing over
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
the winter I've encountered this bill
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
and proposal and I do have some
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the people that um the the
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative that wrote the Bill but I
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to ask questions at that
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
time but um Ben all his answers I think
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
were correct in a lot of those regard my
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
facility oh let me introduce myself I'm
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is Ronald guu I live in
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I own R&amp;B Motorsports
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
which owns the property in Wentworth New
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that currently holds a
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
racetrack and our representative is here
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
and I thank her for being here but um
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
all those things in the way the
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
representative started off as Billy
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
didn't want to change nothing but the
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
amount which is fine but he's looking at
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
in his from what I understood it's eping
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
the town of eping has three
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
racetracks one of them holds a national
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
event at the Dragway New England Dragway
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
holds One National event his expenses
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
for that town maybe a little more
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
because it's one National event yes they
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
do race weekly at New England Dragway or
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
a schedule for the
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
summer but it's one National event that
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
is probably a majority of the traffic
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the same with the town of Lowden
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
with their Nascar event they have one
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
Nascar event they hold other events
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
there throughout the year but they hold
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
one event which really impedes the
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
traffic in the town but on
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
that all the towns businesses um hotels
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
gas stations convenience stores
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
everything they all benefit from the
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
people coming to these events in a small
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
town even the small town gas stations
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
convenience stores most people I mean at
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
our facility we have people that come
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
from all New England states plus New
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
York Canada Pennsylvania as far as
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
Georgia to come up to New Hampshire to
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
race um the licensing fees in my opinion
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
should be regulated by the town that
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
makes the racetrack owner or promoter
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
general manager however you want to word
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
it work with the town hand inand so
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
there is no friction between the town
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
yes racing is noisy we deal with
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors that
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
have concerns on the noise as she said
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
that the um representative stated if the
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
wind's blowing correctly she can hear it
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes that happens every racetrack across
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
the United States of America but these
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
are small businesses there used to be
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
RAC tracks at every Fairgrounds around
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
the country even in New Hampshire I
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
think there's probably in my opinion 10
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
to 15
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
facilities but when you look at other
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
facilities that have to have inspections
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of horse farms they hold
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
horse shows those should all be
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
regulated I don't know if they're not
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's not my business but Fire Marshals
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
all them they should because they all
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
have the same we're our insurance
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
companies do more of an
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
inspection to just cover our liability
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
on a piece of property for what we use
 
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.109 align:start position:0%
on a piece of property for what we use
it

00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%

that the O the uh public hearing should
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%

suggestion
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
of amending this Statewide law this is
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
not a community by Community Law it's
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide to the actual costs and not a
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
hard and fast
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
number uh no I would think it should be

00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
4 I'm introducing this bill HB 165 to
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
you today
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the maximum amount of
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
disaster relief funding provided to
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities after a natural
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
disaster I'm here to correct a wrong
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
that was made last year when the
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
language of this RSA was included in a
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill as B 499 that went to a committee
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
of conference the original Bill language
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
sought for up to $100,000 to possibly be
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
awarded to a municipality after a
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
natural disaster hits their
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
Community the Senate was adamant that
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
the governor would not sign the bill
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
unless the amount was lowered to
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
$25,000 so it was agreed upon that we
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
would settle for a severe reduction in
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
this kind of Grant in order to get the
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
language signed into
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
law I'm simply asking with this bill
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
that the original $100,000 Grant amount
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
be reestablished because we all know
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
$25,000 is hardly disaster relief to any
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
Community it barely helps at all to fix
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
roads temporarily or to be used to help
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
get a community running again after a
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
severe flooding or other natural
 
00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:54.430 align:start position:0%
severe flooding or other natural
disaster

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
hits the bill also Al corrects some
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
language that Homeland Security
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
emergency management suggested so that
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
it is clear that disaster relief funding
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
received by this grant program only
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
applies to this program and is not
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
confused with any other disaster relief
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
funding that a municipality might
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
receive this is a very important change
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
to this language as
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
well some of you know that I've been
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
working on this legislation since severe
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
flooding aworth and other towns in our
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
state in July 2021 and again in July
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
2023 many towns experienced flooding due
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
to heavy rains just so you know the
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
bills that we have passed already in
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
2022 and 2023 for disaster relief the
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
loans um which was uh s sp49 and the
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
state share of payment of non- Fe
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursable expenditures which was s
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
sp402 have not even been accessible or
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
functional to our
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities rules haven't been
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
finished being written and the programs
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
haven't been put into
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
place let's not leave this work undone
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
for another year if a disaster hits we
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
as a state need to be prepared to help
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
our municipalities and give them quick
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
and useful tools to be able to make
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.589 align:start position:0%
and useful tools to be able to make
roads

01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
passable and deal with the emergency
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
especially if they don't have the
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
financial reserves
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
available so I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions and also have provided
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
additional information regarding
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
problems with SB 402 and S SP 409 and I
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
do have written testimony to pass
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
01:01:57.319 --> 01:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
representative

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
Aaron representative Colby thank you
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh is a municipality
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
required to have a FEMA or a Homeland
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
Security approved Hazard mitigation plan
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
in place to qualify for um this type of
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
Grant or disaster relief I don't believe
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
that they are required by Statute to
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
have any uh mitigation plans
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
um certainly most of them
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
do um and I know my town does now but
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
um in so far as the um disaster relief
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
statutes I I don't know I think in the
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
case of the uh The Loan program the zero
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
interest Loan program I believe that
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
they are required to have a mitigation
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
plan thank
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
you further question questions
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard thank you madam
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Aaron and um
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
being from a small community um what
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
means would you have to try to get some
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
of these roads open because again I I
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
remember the floods from several years
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
ago you had some pretty heavy damage and
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
$25,000 doesn't go far what what would
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
you have for other means to be able to
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard well of course a
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
town may have some money put away uh in
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh contingency plan funds or Road and
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
Bridge funds uh they may have some money
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
extra in their um uh fund
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
balance and certainly a smaller
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
Community like aworth where there's 850
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
people in a tax base that can barely
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
maintain the roads that they have when a
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
disaster hits like that it takes many
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
many years to recover um it's
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
devastating so above and beyond what
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
they may have I know with aworth there
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
were many people in our town that
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
volunteered their back you know their
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
back loader or their uh their trucks or
 
01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:08.870 align:start position:0%
back loader or their uh their trucks or
their

01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever uh resources they had
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
at hand they donated to the town they
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
donated their time there is also um
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
Municipal um Mutual
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
aid but when a disaster hits in a
 
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.349 align:start position:0%
aid but when a disaster hits in a
particular

01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
area usually the towns you have mutual
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
Aid with are also busy trying to repair
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
and get their feet back on the ground as
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
well so it was it's kind of um it's kind
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
of a fluid situation you get help where
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
you can get help and I know that our
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
town also requested help from the state
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the from the do uh department where
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
we were able to get signage we were able
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
to get barriers uh on loan and things
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
like like that um
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
so let's just say there was scant help
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
um but certainly an infusion of cash uh
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
from the state would go a long way and
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
help the town uh pay for some of the
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
expenses and
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
um certainly uh
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 kind of isn't enough in that
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
time and $100,000 seems to be more
 
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.750 align:start position:0%
time and $100,000 seems to be more
reasonable

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.390 align:start position:0%
 
additional

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%

and uh this is my second term and I
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill and of course I
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
support the bill all
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
right it's a very simple change and I
 
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
say simple sometimes words matter right
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
so as if you had the bill and you were
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
able to read it it's all about one
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
sentence and what what it does it says
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
or it's this is all about warrant
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
articles and it's this case it's about a
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article many times we
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
go out and we go out in the around the
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and stuff and uh we have a
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
petition article we want to submit and
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
we have to gather the 25 or more uh
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
votes signatures and stuff to be counted
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
and then we bring it into uh being voted
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
on and a lot of times when you get there
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh what happens is uh someone will stand
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
up and amend it to the point of changing
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of it the intent of the
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
petition article would be to go to the
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
voters to have them give an up or down
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
vote but a lot of times they will go to
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
the voters they'll actually change the
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
intent to actually go to the voters to
 
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
say let's study this all right let's
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
study this petition War
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
article where you've already gone out
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
and have done the work the 25 people or
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
more that have actually signed on at
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
that point have already realized that
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is important enough
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we should actually bring it to the
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
people and have them vote on it so the
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
first part of this bill it says you know
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
it says no warrant article shall be
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
amended to eliminate the subject matter
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's not changing of course right so
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's the subject matter so the part
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
that is changing
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
or to change the purpose of our petition
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article so being very specific
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just a warrant article that uh
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the board the school board or the uh
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
select board may bring this is a
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
petition from the people so that's
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about and uh I
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
can give you an
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
example uh where I just stated that uh
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
more than once uh in the district that
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
I'm in school district in this case uh
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
changed petition warrant articles to be
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
studies and it really upsets the people
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
there and and upsets you know the voters
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
at that point point and in some cases
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
depending where if you if you ever been
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
to an sb2 type uh delivera to session uh
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's very um one-sided or
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
the other because especially when it
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
comes to school subjects they tend to
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
come out very strong with uh the teacher
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the staff side of schools depending
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
on you know what the uh warrant is all
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
about so in this case here you know
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
several times this not happen once this
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
is just a my district you know district
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
10 at this point so I'm hoping that
 
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
you'd all see see this and see how
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
important it is that for a petition
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
warrant article that we don't change the
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
intent of it the purpose thank
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative sers are
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chair Madam chair
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative sellers for
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I've been a
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
selectman for a long time uh in my town
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
of Hamstead and I was selectman in mass
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and I always thought this was in the uh
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation already I I thought a
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
petition article was uh sacred and they
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
just weren't able to touch it at all uh
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
the 25 people plus come in asking the
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
question they deserve an answer without
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
anything to be touched to it but when
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
finding out that that was not the case
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
in fact I'm a
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
article mainly because I didn't realize
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
this was not in the legislation and it's
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
something that I think uh is done in
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
most towns but I think we ought to make
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
it clear that this is the way we should
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
be doing business so my question is do
 
01:16:24.199 --> 01:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
be doing business so my question is do
you

01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that uh this uh is
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
needed more more so because people
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
really don't understand what the rules
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
are in petition
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
articles uh thank you representative and
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct um for many many many
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
years in our district can you not hear
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
me all right many many many years in our
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
district we all thought that you
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't change the intent until uh we
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
actually had um The Honorable Ned Gordon
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
as moderator and he corrected us really
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
quick and say no that's not the in the
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
RSA so that's why I've now added it to
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA at this point and you're right I
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
mean you go into these meetings and you
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
think okay they can't change this intent
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
and you just didn't realize and really
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
the RSA just says you cannot eliminate
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
the subject matter so now it's being a
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
specific further questions
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
before I recognize representative Gilman
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
I did want to note that when
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
speaking anybody here in this committee
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
make sure the microphone is close like
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
two Ines and a little bit lower because
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble hearing people so
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is to people on the committee as
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
well as people um providing testimony
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gilman thank
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I we re my
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
town exitor had a a petitioned article
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
for tax cap so the tax there was do you
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
want to have a tax cap of
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
percent is the would you say that the
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
subject matter is
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
the tax cap and the purpose is
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
versa I gota I got to really think about
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
that um because I I'll tell you it was
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
amended at the at the deliberative
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
session okay um tax cap part stay but
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
the amount changed so I I've seen an RSA
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
um and it may be this one or I was just
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
reading it this morning in this one here
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
um and this what is it
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
4013 um that this has nothing to do with
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
the money side so and actually let me
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
just see it's right here um
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it's right here it's it's a it says
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
in this case here it says an amendment
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
that changes the dollar amount of an
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation in an warrant arle shall
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
not be deemed uh to violate the subpar
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
all right so that's that's the money
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
side so the intent would be and what I'm
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
saying in your case would be that tax
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
cap would maybe change to a study
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the voters for a
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
vote that actually to accept or not
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
cap followup Madam chair yes just to
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarify what you have said um
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
because um you didn't use either of the
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
words um elim uh subject matter
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
or purpose in that example of creating a
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
study what's your question I'm sorry
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
didn't well my qu oh I didn't finish I
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
guess my question is uh if changing this
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
to a study committee
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
would what would it fall under the um
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
subject matter or the or the purpose
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
would that be the purpose that would be
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose because your purpose of your
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
petition War article is to bring it to
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
the voters to see if you want to approve
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
a tax cap that's my in so that's the
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
intent of that petition warrant
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
article what what happens is they end up
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
changing it saying well let's bring it
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
to the voters as a study to see if we
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
want to change that tax Gap so they're
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually changed the intent
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
where you were actually going to go for
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
a vote and now it's only a
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
study thank you further
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um for taking
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
this question I thought I'm a town
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
moderator I would never allow someone to
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
say that because that's changing to me
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's like saying Toc two Stu you already
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
changed the the the warrant article to
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
what you what what an attent is so I
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
would I don't
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
know I don't get this part of it to be
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
honest with you because I wouldn't
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
permit this at a town meeting and we're
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
can have one in a week or
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
two yeah the and and and that's what the
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
people would think as well but that's
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
not what's been happening and that's why
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
I am I'm asking I'm asking to be put
 
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
this in writing so now you know know
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the intent cannot be changed the
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
purpose because in in my district it's
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
happened just in the last 5 years it's
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
twice additional
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so we had a
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
similar similar situation we had a
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
proposed tax cap and we actually had
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
discussion with our legal council about
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
whether a tax cap is a dollar amount or
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
a purpose and could it be changed or not
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
it there was an amendment made and there
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
was a discussion so it could get a
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
little muddy of when it becomes to
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
something very specific of that so the
 
01:22:10.199 --> 01:22:11.669 align:start position:0%
something very specific of that so the
clarification

01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
of changing the purpose would have made
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
this difficult potentially so I don't
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
know how you would see again that tax
 
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.590 align:start position:0%
know how you would see again that tax
cap

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
piece um as per purpose versus amount do
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
you have a thought on that so when I'm
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
when I'm thinking through this more is
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
the subject matter really is the tax cap
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
the the dollar amount is the percentage
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
right so you know you go to a delivered
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
assession and still change that three or
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
five or 8% whatever you wanted to this
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that the tax cap
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
itself is is really the subject matter
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
all right but the intent is to bring
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
that petitioned warrant article to the
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
voters for an up or down vote not to
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
make that petition warrant article a
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
study and that's what's been happening
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
case the chair recognizes representative
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair chairwoman
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um while I
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
while I think this makes a whole a whole
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
lot of sense I'm curious uh the newshire
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
municipal Association has written on
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
this subject matter many many times
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
before this type of bill has been before
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
us many times before and suddenly I find
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
myself unable to recall whether intent
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
or purpose is the correct word here and
 
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.550 align:start position:0%
or purpose is the correct word here and
I'm

01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
wondering I mean being an English major
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
I know the difference between the
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
words I'm wondering if we it it should
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
it be purpose or should it be
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
intent and thank you representative and
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's a a good question and honestly I
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
went back and forth several times and I
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
I went and asked a few people at that
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
point and I initially had the word
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
intent they thought purpose was the
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
better way to go all right and so that's
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
why it landed on purpose but you know
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
you're right about the words I mean
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
they're so close but they are a little
 
01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
different thank
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
you additional questions
 
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.390 align:start position:0%
you additional questions
representative

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
you representative sers for taking my
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
question um going back to these two
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
words they are very different words
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
purpose I are you saying to amend the
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
word purpose to intent to just include
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and not intent that's that's all
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
that's here in the in the bill right now
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
is just Pur my my apologies that's okay
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
right the chair recognizes
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative Colby for a
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um we
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
have many sb2 communities um that are
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
not um going into their deliberative
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
sessions uh
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh they aren't having them you know
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
until even the end of February um April
 
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.910 align:start position:0%
until even the end of February um April
May

01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
uh would there be consideration for
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
extending the effective date of this
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
statute um so that commun uh communities
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
residents uh election officials uh such
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
as some Town
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
moderators um would be have an
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of absorb
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh what the new language means to them
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative and that's
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
a good point I mean we do have some Tom
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
meetings in in May you know in this case
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
so no I'm not against doing that and if
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
the committee sees to put that as a July
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 that may be a better date and
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
that way we don't have to worry about
 
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
the elections and this spring at
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
all okay thank you
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question at this point
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add a point of
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarification so it says the the
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
effective date is 60 days after its
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
passage this bill will come out of this
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee it will go to the house floor
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
for a vote then it needs to go to the
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
Senate which is sometime after
 
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
crossover needs to go through their
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
process to the Senate house floor then
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
to the governor's desk so this um
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
probably if it gets that far far will
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
not make it to the governor's desk until
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
sometime during the summer July so very
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
Gilman okay this is going to sound kind
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
of silly but I'm I'm uh like others
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
stuck on the words of U subject matter
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
versus petition and I'm beginning to
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
understand or can find my examples one
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
way or the other but I just wanted to
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
verify with you um in a town which I
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was a official ballot
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
Town um was a a warrant article to
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
change a petitioned article to change
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
the color of their uh police
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
cars and um it was amended to change the
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
color of their police cars to purple or
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
some other odd color would that fall
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
under if the subject matter was painting
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
the police cars but the purpose was
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
painting them blue instead of purple
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
would that not be
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
allowed thank you for the question and
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not the expert here on that but
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
to me that's still all the subject
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
matter you know if you if if the
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
petitioners brought for that warrant out
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
forth they're trying to just say we want
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
the police cars painted blue all right
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
so to me that's the subject matter the
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of it is to say now instead
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
of bringing it to the voters and asking
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
for a vote on that we want to bring it
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
to the voters to study that to see if we
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
should paint it blue to paint them blue
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
so there's still they're changing the
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
whole intent of the warrant article to
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
the point of it it's it becoming it's
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
becoming something else subject matter
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't change all right nor does the
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
Dollar you know the dollar amount could
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
because it has nothing to do with this
 
01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
because it has nothing to do with this
so

01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
um the only way I can explain it I I
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
mean as the uh representative over here
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
it said you know he would never would
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
have changed any warrant doic he would
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
have left it but in our district the
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
moderator thought it was no it that was
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
permissible to do it's not in RSA thank
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
you forther questions the chair
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
Walker um forgive me for my ignorance
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm from a city not from a town are
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
there different kinds of Warrant off
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
articles well my say the warrant there
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
are warrant articles that are submitted
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the say the select board or the
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
school board but then the uh the people
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
can also bring forth a warrant article
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
but they need to gather so many
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
signatures right to show that hey they
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
got some people that are very interested
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
followup yes would would a better way to
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
attack this was to put the language that
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
you can't amend a petitioned warrant
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
article that way it's from the people
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
right from the people to the so the
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
selectman can't change the intent or
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
change the title to deceive voters at
 
01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.229 align:start position:0%
change the title to deceive voters at
town

01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
meeting

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure because you still want
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
to I'm not sure on that I I don't know
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
Murphy when you CH that would have to be
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
done by an an amendment to that warrant
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
article and I would not permit as a
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
moderator that type and I've seen it
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
before I would never permit that type of
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
a an amendment to that warrant article
 
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
because you are changing the warrant
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
article you're taking it from something
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
and making a two-way study that's
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
changing the intent of the Warren
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
article it's not changing the color of
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
the of a vehicle it's not changing the
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
dollar amount it's changing the attend
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
of the Warren article to
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
me I don't know that that's that's like
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
common sense but I don't know you know
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened you're
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
right it does come through as an
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
amendment you're right and I wouldn't
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
permit that Amendment and I think that
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
you know and anybody here when town
 
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%

the the witness would do did you have a
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
question in there that that might have
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
been a lead in but was there a question
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
coming that was already been answered
 
01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.070 align:start position:0%
coming that was already been answered

Lewis I live in Alexandria I'm
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
representing myself and I favor this
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill I've been at meetings Town meetings
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
where the venue is packed by a special
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
interest group and the special interest
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
group will hijack the
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
process they will subvert the
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
will of the electorate by trying to get
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
the warrant article changed typically
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
they will change it to a study group and
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
if they're successful in doing this the
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
stud study group if they study it at all
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
they invariably come back doing the
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
bidding of the special interest group
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is not how the process is supposed
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
to work this bill is very much
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
needed uh the the verbs that come to
 
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
mind uh Mr English major
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh the study the special
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
interest groups they will subvert hijack
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
emasculate eviscerate all kinds of
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
things that it's their way of preventing
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
the uh public the the electorate from
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
voting on a warrant article that was
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
properly lawfully submitted and that
 
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
should not even
 
01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.390 align:start position:0%
should not even
happen

01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes these venues are filled
 
01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes these venues are filled
with

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
students and what kind of a civics
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
lesson are we giving to students by
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
saying okay this is how you get what you
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
want you come in and you hijack the
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
process that's that's that's wrong it
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be happening at all I'm
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
certainly glad to hear that as a
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
moderator you wouldn't allow this but
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
you're you might be the only one there
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
are moderators who do I've seen it and I
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a step in the right
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
direction in preventing that in the
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
future thank you very much Madame
 
01:34:23.239 --> 01:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
future thank you very much Madame
chairman

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir will are you able to take
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question isn't it is
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
it not true that in these uh venues that
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
happen every
 
01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:48.270 align:start position:0%
happen every
spring

01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we heard we we heard a resident
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
moderator uh talk about what things that
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
can happen but isn't it true that
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
between the moderator and the town
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
attorney which should probably be
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
present also that these types of things
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
should are avoided in that way so that
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the meeting isn't hijacked by uh
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
meeting

01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to think it should work
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
that way but I have not seen it work
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
if we put it into the law that says that
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
they can't that makes it
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
explicit follow up
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
yes so the the question that that I have
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know as as as we are now being asked
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
to get involved uh is is would it would
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
it not be better that these type of
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh are determined by the local
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
authorities to to use the legal uh
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
expert expertise that they have between
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
the moderator and the town attorney to
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
resolve these rather than to do them
 
01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
what whatever they think might be the
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
best uh way out of this given that this
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
is happening and this is what the law
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
would prevent I would say
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
no uh local expertise is fine but if the
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
law says they can't do it they can't do
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
it and right now they are doing it and
 
01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative stavis is recognized for
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
a question thank you madam chair and
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me who these
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
special interest groups are and what the
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
process is that they use to as in your
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
words emasculate these
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings well special interest group
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
can be anybody who wants the warrant
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
article defeated
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the way they try to do this is by
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
getting it changed into a study group
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of the warrant
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
article and by getting it made into a
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
study group there is zero chance that
 
01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
the warrant article as proposed is going
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
passed so that's how they hijack the
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
process they're preventing the
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
electorate from voting on the warrant
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
Walker I go back to my first question
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
from the first person how about uh not
 
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
allowing any edits or amendments to a
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article wouldn't that
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh suffice because I've seen it happen
 
01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
in a neighboring
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
town and it was a warrant petition
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
warrant AR article
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
asking the selectman to to be to resign
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
it was changed by the Town Administrator
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
and the town attorney rewarded so it
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
didn't quite ask that and it deceived
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
the public and it passed that they would
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
stay so I see how words can be
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
manipulated from the town Administration
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
or special interest group so my previous
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
question about should it if it's a
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article should it not
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
not be owed to have amendments would
 
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:25.990 align:start position:0%
not be owed to have amendments would
that

01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
suffice well the point of the petition
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
article might be uh as as described in
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the uh in the the bill if it changes the
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that would be an amendment
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
to the petition article but it would not
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
change the purpose or the
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
intent uh I don't see that as a reason
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
as a thing that should
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
be eliminated I think that that's a if
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendments if they don't change the
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
intent I don't see a problem with that
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's when they try to make an amendment
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent the Warren article from
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
getting uh as as proposed as intended uh
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
from from the electorate voting on
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
chair you talk about the special
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
non-voters sometimes they're
 
01:39:35.589 --> 01:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
non-voters but uh well for instance
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes a moderator will allow these
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
non voters to
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
speak at this at the
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
meeting um if they're not voting and and
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're not even of legal age I don't
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
see that they should be
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
speaking but they they certain shouldn't
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
be trying to modify something that
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be voting on not
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
on but I've seen
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony do
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
you have anything written I do not okay
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
you the final pink card that I have for
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
Dees oh I like this card you guys put
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
out uh my name is Brody Dees I represent
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
we are a um volunteering membership
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
organization nonpartisan nonprofit that
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
represents the municipalities in cities
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we are
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as it's currently
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
written um
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
our position is that um all waren
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
articles should be treated the same
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're petitioned or they come
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the governing body and to treat um
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
to have two different classifications
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
for how um at a deliberative session
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're treated could not only get
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
confusing but kind of takes away the
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
power of the public body to amend make
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
changes or even to the governing body to
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
try to make a warrant article whether
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's petitioned um or not um legal which
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
can become an issue that um you guys
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
have touched upon with some questions
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
um we believe public body should have a
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
right to amend like the legislature when
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
a bill is introduced as a committee you
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to change that bill um to
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
make it legal to make it work with
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
current legislative language and um and
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
the entire legislature could even
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
disagree with your recommendation or
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
amendments and adopt its own position as
 
01:41:43.229 --> 01:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
a house before it goes on to the next
 
01:41:43.239 --> 01:41:45.390 align:start position:0%
a house before it goes on to the next
chamber

01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
um part of the reason for the ter
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
current language um in front of us on
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
the uh line three where it says no
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
warrant article shall be amended to
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the subject matter um the
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
legislature took action after sb2 passed
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
and towns adopted it to make it so then
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
um governing bodies or even the public
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
bodies couldn't just amend a petition
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
warn article to delete the entire
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
article except for the first three words
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
um which became somewhat of an issue and
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds strange I know but that had
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
happened in some towns so that is the
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
purpose for subject matter that you
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have these um at deliberative
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
session you wouldn't have the voters
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the entire subject matter
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so then essentially the warn article
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
would be null and voided as if nothing
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
was ever
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
introduced um there are times where at a
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
deliberative session uh changes need to
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
be made to make a warrant article
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
petitioned or not legal um sometimes
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
petitioners um you know not everyone in
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
your community is a lawyer not everyone
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
always understands um you know the
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
process but they want to be involved and
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
they want to see a change in their
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
community and sometimes as uh as a
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan mentioned your
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
Town's moderator and your legal counsel
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
and your governing bodies ultimately
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
with the consent of those at
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
deliberative the public body need to
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
make a change so then the Warren warrant
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
article can actually be legal and
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
implemented in the community um
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
something this bill doesn't necessarily
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
take into account is um that there are
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
times where there are changes that the
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
petitioner may want and um it might not
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
be entirely in line with what you know
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
quote purpose is defined as um so you
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
could actually limit the petitioners or
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
those at the public public body their
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
right to change it so then it's more in
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
line with what their quote purpose would
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
be um there's also the issue of no
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
petitioner attends so um purpose can't
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
be deciphered you might get a petition
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
warn article in the whole public body
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it has happens sometimes in
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
communities we've seen where the whole
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
public body and the governing bodies and
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
the moderator and legal counsel are just
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
confused with what the ultimate intent
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
would be of a petition warn article um
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
also purpose is not clearly defined as
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard today A lot of people are
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
kind of talking about what's a better
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
word intent or purpose well uh my
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is purpose is why or the
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal of a petition warrant
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
article so one could argue that if you
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
put in a petition warrant article for
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
say we talked about tax caps that
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
changing the percentage that would
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
change the purpose of that petition warn
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
article you'd be changing the ultimate
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
percentage so the ultimate goal of the
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
warn article intent is how or
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
determination to achieve that goal so um
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
intent actually might be not the best
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
word to use because the intent would be
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the process you have an
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
intent but your purpose is what you want
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
your outcome to be Mr Dees uh you've
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
exceeded the three minutes could you
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
wrap it up quickly um my last point was
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
just going to be that um the current
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
language allows the flexibility for
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
governing bodies with consent of their
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
public bodies at deliberative to make uh
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
to treat all petition sorry to treat all
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
warn articles the same and to respect
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
the process and the will of the voters
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
um and with that I can take any
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
01:45:02.239 --> 01:45:03.870 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman and
 
01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the the petition warrant article is
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
debatable as far as I know by the by the
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
body is the body only the voting members
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the town or is it a public public
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
meeting open to anyone where anyone can
 
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the petition warrant article
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
the only people who can vote on the
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
waren Articles and to vote on amendments
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
to the Warren articles petitioned or not
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
are those who are residents duly
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
registered and who can you know qualify
 
01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
to vote um they are public meetings open
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
to the public so anyone can attend
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's press whether it's people
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 but they are not
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote so it's a free speech
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
issue you can't deny them access and you
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
can't deny them their ability to speak
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the chair recognizes
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you madam
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
chair is it the nh's position that that
 
01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
chair is it the nh's position that that
an

01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
amendment at the town meeting uh can be
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
to amend the the uh article to zero
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
amount is that is that a legal uh
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
option the warrant article right to to
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
amend the the amount of the warant
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
article to a zero not not just the first
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
three words but the entire article to
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
zero um I wouldn't call it our position
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
but I think I
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
think I'd have to double check but I
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
think legally yes the public body could
 
01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
zero out a warrant article or change you
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
know even if they couldn't zero it out
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
they could change the dollar amount to
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
$1 effectively making it you know kind
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
of N and void so if you wanted to spend
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
for example a bridge and you know people
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
decided they didn't want to replace said
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
bridge and they decided to change the
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
worn article amount to $1 obviously if
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
it costs half a million dollars to build
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
the bridge you know you're not going to
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
be able to build it with $1 I don't know
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of contract it would take a
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
dollar to rebuild Municipal bridge to to
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
the state and federal standards so thank
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
stavis for a question thank you madam
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
question is it any nh's position that
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
under public meeting laws there is no
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
such thing as an outside interest or a
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
special interest since everyone is
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak if not to
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
vote I don't think we have a position
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
per se but I think legally um anyone who
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
is allowed to access a public meeting is
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to access a public meeting and
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
only those who are duly registered to
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
vote are allowed to participate in the
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
votes at Del liberative session
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know as long as they're a
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
resident they're not a special interest
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
group and if they have an interest in
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
attending and watching the meeting then
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
they do like any other citizen or
 
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
resident or uh human
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
France is an outside
 
01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
interest um allowed to bring forth an
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
amendment even though they don't vote on
 
01:48:21.239 --> 01:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
amendment even though they don't vote on
it

01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
anybody who's a member of the public
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
body who's duly registered to vote and
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in deliberative
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
session is allowed to bring forward an
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and has to be duly seconded um
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not a special interest it would
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
be a resident of the Town who's allowed
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know who showed up show that they're
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
registered to vote you know registered
 
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
to attend and everything typically they
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
give you a little placard at least in my
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
town we get a w in the year on it I
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
always save mine for every deliberative
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
session just so I can keep track how
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%

her to go ahead and explain the the
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
change that would be made after I leave
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
here this morning Madam
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
chair so house bow 348 um is intent is
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
to say that the
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiary that is receiving local
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
welfare funds lives in the said town
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
that they are receiving the funds
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
from so New Hampshire and its Infinite
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
Wisdom with their local control has
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
establish this local
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
welfare because at the time it was my
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that the people that live
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the town know best of the Town
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
economics and the town's Commerce it was
 
01:52:45.629 --> 01:52:45.639 align:start position:0%
intended to be neighbors helping
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors over the F last few years
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
since I've been a representative I have
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
witnessed the local Town's welfare
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
budget have just grown
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
exponentially everybody keeps on saying
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
that there is you know this this crisis
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
this economy crisis they're talking
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
about the inflation everybody says we
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
need to do something but nobody really
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
ever steps back and does something that
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
I have actually seen this is an attempt
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
to actually bring the local welfare
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
budgets back to the local
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
level So within the welfare RSA 165
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
towns are allowed to set
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines however Within These
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines there is this list of
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable items that must be
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
included and one of the things that it
 
01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:35.719 align:start position:0%
says is that if a person appears in
 
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
front of the local welfare officer that
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
he or she shall me shall be relieved
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are a resident of
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
that town that is what I am attempting
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
to change
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
today so I also when I changed this I
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
was very specific when it said the word
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
resident to keep that for this chapter
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
resident for the purpose of this chapter
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
because you cannot pay me enough to talk
 
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
about residency when it comes to
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
election law so for the purpose of this
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
chapter what residency actually means
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
and I had put in some criteria which
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be a car registration a copy of a
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
signed lease um maybe utility bill uh
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
one of the agreed changes was an
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
oversight on my part I should have put
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
about a government issued ID so that is
 
01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
something that you know reasonably I'm
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to put that change another thing
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was discussed was the addition
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
of other proof of residency whether that
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
was a social worker a written statement
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
ATT testing that they have seen this
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
person live in the town um maybe
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
something that says that you know this
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
person is self-paying at a hotel but you
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
know I have seen them actually you know
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
partake in
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
community I would like to leave that up
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
to the governing body right so I'm
 
01:55:05.229 --> 01:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to keep this a local
 
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
control so if the governing body wants
 
01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.149 align:start position:0%
control so if the governing body wants
to

01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
adopt this up to x amount of days which
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get to because that's been
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
requested to be
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
changed so if the governing body Madam
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
chair wants to say you know we want you
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
to have to live here for x amount of
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
days days and in addition to this
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
minimal requirements we are also going
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
to accept these other forms of
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
residency that is something that we were
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
discussing again I would like it to be
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
left to the local municipality to be
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
able to vote on what they would like
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
those changes to
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
be so last session Senate Bill 110
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
passed and my understanding is that was
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
going to try to help relieve some of the
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
confusion when it comes to local welfare
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
so if a a person goes to person lives in
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
town a and then they go to town B for
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and they and they are
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
you know given some welfare
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
dollars what was happening is some
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
towns some towns are saying hey wait a
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
minute you know town a owes us money
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
because we provided assistance to to
 
01:56:15.639 --> 01:56:16.550 align:start position:0%
because we provided assistance to to
this

01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
person so in my opinion what was meant
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
to help clear up some confusion has
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
actually created a lot of confusion and
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
it's actually creating some animosity
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
between towns so because you're allowed
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
to make your own guidelines town a may
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
not allow for certain expenses that
 
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
maybe Town B does allow for so now when
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
the person goes to that second Town it
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
could be that those expenses are allowed
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
which they weren't originally which made
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
the person maybe not qualify in that
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
town or additionally it could just be
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
that that particular welfare officer
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they maybe they didn't check maybe
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
they just maybe they're just not as
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
sticklers for the rules as other people
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
are so what's LED that to be is Town B
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
is now saying hey you you know you owe
 
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
us money because we provided relief to
 
01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.669 align:start position:0%
us money because we provided relief to
this

01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
person towns don't really necessarily
 
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
like that now I I know that that was the
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
intention of that was meant to be good
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
and I've learned this morning I might
 
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
not be totally understanding it and
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay but the point is is we're
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
back to there's confusion right because
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
people just understand it to be
 
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
different and I don't know the solution
 
01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
different and I don't know the solution
to

01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
that so some of the other
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
changes that that were discussed
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
was having the having the wording be
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
special consideration and decision and
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
decision consideration shall be provided
 
01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.229 align:start position:0%
decision consideration shall be provided
for

01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-residents um reporting domestic
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
violence or human trafficking situations
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
within their own town of origin as many
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
of you know I I'm a staunch Fighter for
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
for anybody that is in a domestic
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
violence situation or a person that has
 
01:58:05.709 --> 01:58:05.719 align:start position:0%
experienced sexual assault I I know from
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
doing this job that nobody has ever
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
called the local welfare office and said
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm preparing to leave an abuser can
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
I can you put me in a hotel like that
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
that has never happened and it's also
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
the understanding that that's not how
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
that happens if anything these are these
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
are pre-arranged the person's going to
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
go to a safe house Etc
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
I I'm willing to put that in there I
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's going to matter
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
either way but if it's a safeguard that
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
that is something I'm not I'm not going
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
to fight over that that's that's fine um
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
there was also a a request
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
for um the additional wording that you
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
know if a person you know shows up and
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
they're not a resident that the the
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
overseer is able to you know provide
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
this temporary
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
relief again I think that should be up
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
to the governing body if they want to
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
make those exceptions they can certainly
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
make those exceptions but I think that
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
should be up to them I don't think that
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
the state should say this is what you
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
do so you know sometimes you have you
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
have Bad actors right so I had an
 
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.189 align:start position:0%
have Bad actors right so I had an
example

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
of a landlord rent it out an apartment
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
the the the young woman only lived there
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
for a few days she called up and said
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
hey I need you to pay my rent I said
 
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
what what and she wasn't she wasn't able
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
to pay the rent and when I asked her why
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
did you sign this lease I'm very
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
confused can you help me understand why
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
why did you even sign the lease and she
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
said well because I needed a place to
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
live and I knew you had to help me so I
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
called up the landlord and said do you
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
realize that she's not she doesn't she
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
has no intentions of paying this and he
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
said well yes but I told her to come to
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
you because I know that you have to help
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
that that's not okay right that the
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
people that are coming up with with this
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
t with these tax dollars some of them
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
are working two jobs some of them are
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
retired working two jobs this is real
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
people with real budgets that are
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
struggling to come up with their tax
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
dollars I don't think that it's too much
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
to ask at the very least a person that
 
02:00:09.629 --> 02:00:09.639 align:start position:0%
signs a lease is able to at least live
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
there for one month and and be able to
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
to pay that that's why I wanted to make
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
this as much local control as
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
possible representative rhods um yes
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
you're approaching eight minutes and we
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
you give me three minutes Madam chair
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
three minutes additional no no no I I I
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
said did you give me three minutes I was
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
giving you five um we have 11 pink cards
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%

based on the bill as
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
introduced um you touched on victims of
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
Violence uh they often find themselves
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
in extremely dire
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh they flee abusers uh it
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
planned um necessarily uh they depart
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
with their children maybe uh minimal
 
02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:52.229 align:start position:0%
with their children maybe uh minimal
belongings

02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
belongings
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
many of the individuals have already
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
been deprived of their
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
autonomy um and their financial
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
Independence so they're not going to
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
appear on a car registration they're not
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
going to appear on a lease uh or a
 
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
utility bill and they may not have the
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
ID when they
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
leave um these folks would struggle to
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
provide um the proof of residence that
 
02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.229 align:start position:0%
provide um the proof of residence that
is

02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
stipulated um how would you propose that
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
these or other vulnerable individuals
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh could obtain assistance and
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
support um if they lack this necessary
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
documentation thank you for the
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
question If a person is in the situation
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you described and that I had
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
described The Advocates is an example of
 
02:02:40.719 --> 02:02:41.709 align:start position:0%
described The Advocates is an example of
the

02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
Coalition they help those families to
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
first of all get themselves back on
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
their feet they're usually provided a
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
safe house if not an out andout
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
apartment on their own and I do know
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
that from my understanding working with
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
the Coalition that they actually have
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
like a housing Advocate that helps them
 
02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:01.709 align:start position:0%
like a housing Advocate that helps them
to

02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:01.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
reestablish reestablish
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
residency so that they they are provided
 
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
with the assistance that that is
 
02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:13.390 align:start position:0%
with the assistance that that is
absolutely

02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
needed um I'll allow a a quick followup
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
but I would like to remind members that
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
make every attempt to frame your
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
question very
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
succinctly and avoid long leadings
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
followup um if they're if they are
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
establishing residency once they leave
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
the house then it wouldn't meet your
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
90day the 90-day requirement in the
 
02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.549 align:start position:0%
90day the 90-day requirement in the
statute

02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
correct representative I I don't know
 
02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
the answer to that I think that you're
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that just because of person's
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
leaving a situation if I'm understanding
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they have to go to the local
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
welfare office that might not even be
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
the case they may be they may be set up
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
with their Advocate to where they don't
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
they don't need to go and if they did I
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
that further questions the chair
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you madam chair to build
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
on the previous
 
02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
on the previous
question

02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh under this system they without the
 
02:04:30.669 --> 02:04:30.679 align:start position:0%
with the 90 days so that you would would
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
why do we have local welfare at all if
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have all these other sources of help
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
welfare representative I I'm certain
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
that I can't answer that question I
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
think that would be a a state level I I
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you without any doubt if I
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
wrote a law to completely abolish RSA
 
02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
165 that would probably go over like a
 
02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
165 that would probably go over like a
hot

02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
hot
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
rock followup Madam chair yes isn't this
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill doing actually doing that with if
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
you put the 90 days on you the
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
limitation on of the people that you
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
would serve with that 90day residency
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
would be probably
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
nil so don't you think that this bill is
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
actually doing what I suggested and that
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
was to doway with local
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
welfare thank you for the for the
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up question representative I
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
disagree I I don't think that this is
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
doing that at all if you actually look
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
RSA there is a plethora of services that
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
are available I was suggesting that the
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
person receiving the funds live in the
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
town that is
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
providing the assistance right thank you
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your answers further
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so it's
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a a two-parter so are you saying
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
for 90 days they wouldn't receive any
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
assistance at all from a prior town or a
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
town that they might move into thank you
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the question so for clarification
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
the 90 days is going to be changed there
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
was suggestion to make it 30 I suggested
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
possibly 60 I had get was given some
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
information from somebody I met with
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
earlier that we actually may have to
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
make it 30
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
um but to answer your question
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
the there are there are services that
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
are available to people without having
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
to go to the local welfare office a lot
 
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
of times people don't like to reach out
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
to those Services because it's a little
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
bit encumbersome but it's encumbersome
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
for a reason um the way I wrote it is
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
not to be able to receive you know
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
receive this was like you know rent
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
possibly um but keep in mind the way the
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
law is written now it is you know the
 
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:05.830 align:start position:0%
law is written now it is you know the
prior

02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
prior
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
town the the prior town would basically
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
be responsible but the way the law is
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
also written is you're not allowed the
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
welfare officer is not allowed to
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
suggest to the person to go back to that
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
prior town it's a little bit conv
 
02:07:20.189 --> 02:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
convoluted so what's happening is towns
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
are getting angry at each other other
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
because there's this question of who who
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
is responsible who's responsible to pay
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to clear that up so if
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
Town B did not want to they want you to
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
actually be resident to receive those
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
Services they would actually have that
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
option where now they don't have that
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
option at
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
all kind do very quick followup quick
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
followup um so a family that might
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
become homeless is a quick situation
 
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they would have might they
 
02:07:49.069 --> 02:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
might move immediately because they're
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
now homeless they're not able to
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
my concern is you'd have to wait now it
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
might be 30 days which the amendment
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
would would be probably preferable but
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
they'd have to wait to be able to ask
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
for help was that thank you for the
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
question one of the suggestions was to
 
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
put and again this is what I wanted to
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
leave up to the to the voting body or
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
the governing body was whether or not
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
they they can still apply but according
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
to the guidelines if this was adopted
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't qualify for those
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines Madam chair if I may when I
 
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
wrote this
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
it was just written like this I've since
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
learned that Massachusetts and Maine
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
have changed their Massachusetts changed
 
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
their right the shelter to be 30 days
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and Maine has changed their their hotel
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
cost I believe it's $1,300 a
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
month that this goes back to what local
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
welfare was meant to be right so if
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask the people to come up
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:08:49.549 --> 02:08:49.559 align:start position:0%
money I fear what's going to happen is
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
people from Massachusetts are going to
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
say say will go up to New Hampshire or
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
people from Maine are going to say go
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
over to New Hampshire and that is
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not local control or what this
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%

to communicate and coordinate assistance
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
options how is that not
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
adequate thank you for the question that
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
that was what I was explaining that past
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
last year which was Senate Bill 110
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
where it's creating confusion over
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what the municipalities are
 
02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
allowed ask other municipalities to do
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
and when I spoke with the gentleman from
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
The Welfare
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
Association he's able to explain that
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
and explain why it actually why the
 
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
confusion actually does
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
exist additional
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative

02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in RSA 165

section 2 B There is a disqualification
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
for certain Property Transfers which
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
would appear to completely bar the
 
02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that you suggested of
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
people coming from Maine or
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Vermont or wherever and
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you're familiar with that
 
02:10:33.079 --> 02:10:34.990 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you're familiar with that
section

02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative if the chairman would lie
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
you to read it it it's not anything that
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.149 align:start position:0%
Advocates I'm happy to read it it's very
short

02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
short
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
quickly no person who is otherwise
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for assistance under this
 
02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
chapter shall receive such assistance if
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
he has made an assignment transfer a
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%

for such
 
02:11:08.589 --> 02:11:08.599 align:start position:0%
assistance representative I would
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that you that you talk with the
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
the experts behind me about it because
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you're not allowed
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
to it it says it right in there whether
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:27.960 align:start position:0%

question and being here today um by
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
creating another definition of Resident
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
have you is it possible that you have
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
created a situation where somebody can
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
be viewed as being two different types
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
of people I'm I'm I'm defined as a res
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
now under this but in 2 years from now
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
how do I change back to being a resident
 
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.149 align:start position:0%
how do I change back to being a resident
under

02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
21 uh colon 6 I I I I'm just curious if
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
we have created a level of
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
residency which
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
may hurt somebody hurt not physically
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
but you know create a problem thank you
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
for the question I I actually disagree
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
so I was very specific to say for
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
welfare purposes for local welfare
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
purposes and if I may add representative
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
that was also a suggestion from The
 
02:12:32.549 --> 02:12:32.559 align:start position:0%
Advocates to make it be specific to that
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
section you're
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
you representative um I know that it is
 
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
the duty of every town and City to
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
provide uh welfare Assistance or
 
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
assistance to people in need um but and
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
if if I have a line item in my budget
 
02:13:03.639 --> 02:13:04.950 align:start position:0%
if if I have a line item in my budget
for

02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
$445,000 welfare relief and I have
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
50,000 um and the town's budget is tight
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't it be make it more
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
flexible for the town with less money
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
to get assistance themselves from
 
02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.950 align:start position:0%
to get assistance themselves from
another

02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
town um which goes back to the lines you
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
change I I'm just saying I'm asking um
 
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more flexible to provide
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
the needs for those uh who need
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
it representative I I'm sorry but I'm
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
very confused by your question
 
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I what I'm sorry I I'm just
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
saying the the the way 1651 C is written
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
now with the communicate and coordinate
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
assistance if one town runs out of money
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
in their welfare budget um could they
 
02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:02.599 align:start position:0%
not coordinate and communicate with
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
another town that provides that can
 
02:14:06.669 --> 02:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
assist uh the
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
needy thank you for the question I I do
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
not believe that one town can go to
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
another town and ask them to help with
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
their welfare budget line I I don't
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
think that that's possible to do
 
02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
the that Senate bill that you're talking
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
about was meant
 
02:14:27.629 --> 02:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
for was meant for if a person is is
 
02:14:27.639 --> 02:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
for was meant for if a person is is
receiving

02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
funds from being in another town that
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
they might not necessarily reside in and
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
it gives an option for that second town
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to be reimbursed for funds
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
that were made available to the to the
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
person I I don't see how it could
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
possibly be where I could ask a town the
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
town of Swansea as an example could say
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
to the town of Troy
 
02:14:53.229 --> 02:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
can you give us money for our welfare
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%

02:19:36.669 --> 02:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
348 despite the apparent intent of this
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
bill to protect municipalities from
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
having to pay for um loc local welfare
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
for individuals who may not live in
 
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
their towns it could have some severe
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for folks
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
illness um especially those folks that
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
are leaving treatment facilities or
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
jails I just wanted to call folks
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
attention today and I'll be very brief
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
because I know that you're behind
 
02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
schedule to people leaving designated
 
02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities those are folks
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
that were involuntarily admitted to
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
those hospitals did not have a choice
 
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
about what hospital they were going to
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and could be there for months if not
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
years when they are discharged they are
 
02:20:21.790 --> 02:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
discharged to the street to wherever
 
02:20:25.230 --> 02:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
they were the hospital they were in and
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have any proof that
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
they have been there other than their
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
hospital records and if they are
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
discharged and need local assistance
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
they have absolutely not a single town
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire to go to
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass the other
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to bring to
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
attention to the committee is we have
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
heard from a mom of an adult young man
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
who has a severe mental illness Ness who
 
02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
was recently released from Valley Street
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
jail after being there for a year he was
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
found not competent to stand trial and
 
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
was never restored within that year long
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
period that the state allows he was
 
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
released with three days worth of
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
medication at of Valley Street jail and
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass and Manchester were
 
02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
these the elements of this bill then
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that young man could not go to City Hall
 
02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and ask for assistance
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
with his
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
medication which would then potentially
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
lead to him having more symptoms of his
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
mental illness and could result in him
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
being re-incarcerated again or
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalized so I just asked for your
 
02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
consideration of the populations that
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
this could impact um and for these
 
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
reasons Nami New Hampshire is opposed to
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm happy to take any
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
kazinski so prior to incarceration or uh
 
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalization did these folks have
 
02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
hospitalization did these folks have
residency

02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
residency
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere most of them did but then they
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
would have lost their tency and if you
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
lose your tency you no longer have a
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
valid lease that you can use to prove a
 
02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
residency if they're hospitalized sorry
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%

02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing that we have experienced we have
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
four in my side of town on West we have
 
02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
four residents uh four apartment
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
buildings or low income buildings we
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
have two senior
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
centers apartments on the north side of
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
town we have two seniors and one being
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
built it's going to increase our
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
um the property the property taxes that
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
are collected from these are not going
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of school they're not
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to cover the cost of an added
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
police we're going to need which are
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult as you know to find right
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
now fire uh Etc and also the local
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
assistance that we have to provide I do
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
not think it's difficult to ask that
 
02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
they actually we pay for
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
residents now the exceptions I've just
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
heard that can be worked out there
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
certain people don't fall through the
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
cracks property taxes have gone Skyhigh
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
in almost every community in the
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
area and senior citizens uh veterans may
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
lose their
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
homes because they can't afford the
 
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
property tax that's what I'm hearing
 
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
from my people now Swansea is lucky as
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
veterans in Swansea a bit little bit
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
luckier because we get some good
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
benefits from our
 
02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
town so I pay back my town by
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
volunteering my
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
services I am in strong support of this
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
because I think the property taxes they
 
02:25:35.550 --> 02:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
need to have for we need relief from our
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes and that's the only way
 
02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to get it to make sure that
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are actually paying for those
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
citizens that are in our towns thank you
 
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%

percentage of swansea's um annual budget
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%

uh Town Administrator might be able to
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
provide that answer uh but I know it's
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh grown quite a bit in the last
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
year the last number I heard at a
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
selectboard meeting I attended was like
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%

2886 I
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
about uh little about a little over
 
02:26:30.319 --> 02:26:34.590 align:start position:0%
about uh little about a little over
eight

introduction to the commission the
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
commission was created during the 2019
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislative session to advise the
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
governor and general court on issues
 
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
related to Aging in response to the
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
rapid transformational permanent
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
demographic shift our state is going
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
through to an older age population so um
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
with that said the commission advises
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
against uh this particular bill hb3
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
48 um the commission would like to call
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
your attention to um The Landmark
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases Shiro versus Thomas
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
and uh Sans versus row and other CL case
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
law which s uh suggest that residency
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
requirements for welfare assistance are
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
generally considered unconstitutional to
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
not deny uh welfare benefits solely
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
based on the length of a time a person
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
has resided in a local essentially
 
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
penalizes an individual for exercising
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
the right to travel and does not provide
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
equal protection I will say that the
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
commission began looking into this issue
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
um out of concern for the increasing
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of older adults falling
 
02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
falling into poverty and even
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness um the census bureau's
 
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
official poverty rate increased from 6.2
 
02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
official poverty rate increased from 6.2
to

02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
7.9% between 2019 and uh 2022 in the 65
 
02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:44.200 align:start position:0%

supplemental po poverty measure a
 
02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
measure some feels more accurate as it
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
adjust for local cost was
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
14.4% in 2022 for granite sters age 65
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
higher than the same measure for grite
 
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:02.200 align:start position:0%

population in 2023 was aged 55 and older
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
this is an increase of 12.5%
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
over 2022 figures and
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%

this uh testimony um there's a a um a
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
nice little graph that shows um poverty
 
02:29:43.389 --> 02:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
rates for the 65 plus population in New
 
02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by County at the top and and
 
02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
the bottom graph shows the rapid uh
 
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
transformational demographic shift that
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
I spoke about thank thank you for your
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
time thank you Miss Sky questions oh are
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions absolutely
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognizes representative
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um my
 
02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
question is do you believe based on some
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
of the data that you were speaking to
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
and have in your uh your letter to us
 
02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
that it would eliminate budgets needed
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
for these costs or just delay the cost
 
02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
by 30 to 90 days
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's a very good
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
question um and and you just have to
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
wonder what would happen to folks I
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that that's of
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
concern for the Commission on Aging is
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
that um um the challenge that many older
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
adults whether they have cognition um
 
02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's an increased likelihood of of
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
cognition issues especially amongst um
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
homeless population and there b uh or
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
the or folks who have gone through a um
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
significant transition that might cause
 
02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
them to go seek out welfare about their
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
ability to to gather the necessary uh
 
02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
proof of residency that's named in this

representative
 
02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
grund thank you again Madam chair i'
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
would like to ask you the same question
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
do you think that this legislation would
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
reduce cost to towns or do you think it
 
02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
would just delay the cost by 30 to or 90
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
days depending on what the amendment
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
says I I can't say for sure but I think
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
it would ensure that the towns that are
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
paying for the cost would be more likely
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
the place where the individual had
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
previously resided versus going to
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
another Community going from town to
 
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
town to hop for resources would be more
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
likely that that would they would be
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
receiving assistance from the community
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh where they had resided I think
 
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
overall Statewide it probably would end
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
up being similar but it would be shared
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
resided further
 
02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls Mr Steven
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Tower and after that I will call Ms
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%

Assistant
 
02:33:22.389 --> 02:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
I am the director of our local welfare
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
project and have been since 2020 I work
 
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
very closely with local welfare
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
administrators across the state and the
 
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
local welfare administrators Association
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
on a variety of issues um and try to do
 
02:33:36.429 --> 02:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
so in as collaboratively an approach as
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
possible um so this bill would change
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
the texts of RSA 165 colon one um
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
removing the line uh whether or not they
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
have residents there which some may be
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
thinking is a a strange line uh I
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
brought with me a copy of the New
 
02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revised statutes from
 
02:33:59.710 --> 02:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
1843 and uh back in 1843 the text of
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
this uh statute was word for word the
 
02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
same except uh it it said whether or not
 
02:34:07.309 --> 02:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
they have residence there is a current
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
language in 1843 it said whether or not
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
they had settlement in such Town
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
effectively the same language and that
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
language has been with us basically to
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
Colonial times it's been with us through
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
the Great Depression it's been through
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
the 60s and the 70s it was with us
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
through uh the Great Recession and it is
 
02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
with us today and and there's a reason
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
for that which is RSA
 
02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
165 um allows people to apply and access
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
assistance in the town that they are in
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
but does Define ultimate financial
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility the person who has to
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
foot the bill at the end of the day as
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
the place where they have residence
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
under the statute um and the reason for
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is to avoid someone being denied
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
assistance because of a dispute with a
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
town where a town says we don't we don't
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
believe that you have access to the
 
02:35:02.910 --> 02:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
program under this statute you need to
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else and then they go to
 
02:35:07.269 --> 02:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
that town and that town says no we don't
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
think you have residency here either and
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
so the person who is in generally
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
desperate need would get caught in this
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
pingpong situation between towns and the
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
statute is written such that when there
 
02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
is a dispute like that between a town as
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
to where they think the person's true
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
residency lies um that can be resolved
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
through the towns under sections RSA 165
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
colon 19 and colon 20 or is it I believe
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's 20 and 20a um but uh so I I have
 
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about removing the the
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
the sentence in there about uh whether
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
or not they have residency would have a
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on my clients but
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
more specifically the requirement for a
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
durational residency for the town that
 
02:35:59.269 --> 02:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
is stated in the statute whether it is
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
90 days or 30 days uh imposes a
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
substantial problem if somebody were to
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
move and two and a two and a half months
 
02:36:11.389 --> 02:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
later they are injured at work or are
 
02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
fired or need heating oil in the winter
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to access local
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
welfare assistance in the town that they
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
have moved to like any other resident of
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
the town would nor as this is written
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
would they be able to get access under
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
local welfare from their prior residents
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
because they would not be able to
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
establish 90 days of continuous
 
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
residency in their prior residence
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't have residency any
 
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
there there anymore um so as written for
 
02:36:42.269 --> 02:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
the time period stated in the statute a
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
person who has relocated either because
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
they have moved or because they have
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
became homeless and no longer have a
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
place that they could domicile in the
 
02:36:54.910 --> 02:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
town that they resided and ended up in a
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
tent or in their car in another town
 
02:36:59.309 --> 02:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
they would lose access to local welfare
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state for the period of
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
time stated in the statute um my other
 
02:37:06.269 --> 02:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
major and probably bigger concern about
 
02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
the statute is as one of the the prior
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses stated the new the US Supreme
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
Court has ruled several times that a
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
durational requirement for public
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
benefits is unconstitutional um the
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
first time was in
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
1969 uh there was a lot of litigation in
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
the 70s and 80s about well is there
 
02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
wiggle room with the decision that the
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court came up with and
 
02:37:31.710 --> 02:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
consistently every federal court case
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
that ruled on these durational
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
requirements struck them down um there
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
was again uh in the 90s where you may
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
remember there was a big welfare reform
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed during the Clinton
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
Administration Congress included in that
 
02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
welfare reform Bill statements that
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
states could impose durational
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirements so Congress told states
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
that they could do this states started
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing it and those durational
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
requirements were struck down again and
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in 1999 specifically
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
said Congress can't authorize states to
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
violate the constitutional rights around
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
equal protection and the privileges and
 
02:38:10.349 --> 02:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
immunities clause um so as this is
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
drafted the bill
 
02:38:17.710 --> 02:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
would encourage or enable towns to uh
 
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
pass local welfare rules that would
 
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
violate the constitution so it is
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
unknowingly putting local welfare
 
02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
officers in the situation where they may
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking the lead of this legislative body
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
enact one of these durational
 
02:38:36.269 --> 02:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
requirements um and possibly end up in a
 
02:38:36.279 --> 02:38:37.389 align:start position:0%
requirements um and possibly end up in a
very

02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
expensive federal civil rights
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
litigation case um and that's not good
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
for the town I do I like working with
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
the towns I like being able to work out
 
02:38:50.309 --> 02:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
good Solutions with them them and I do
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
not want to see any Town end up in that
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
situation now there has been some
 
02:38:57.630 --> 02:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
testimony here including from the prime
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor of concerns about towns paying
 
02:39:02.269 --> 02:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
for costs that aren't fairly
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
attributable to the town and I do agree
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
that that is something that I'm very
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about because those costs
 
02:39:11.790 --> 02:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
incurred by the town secondhand impact
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
my clients because towns are less
 
02:39:16.110 --> 02:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable assisting people if they
 
02:39:17.269 --> 02:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
feel like they're kind of getting the
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
short end of the stick from say another
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
town or something like that um so I'm
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
very interested in trying to find ways
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
to reduce those costs per towns but
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these residency
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that have a durational
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
element to it are not the way to do it
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to work with the sponsor
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
and other parties to try to find ways to
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
cut the cost for towns thank you okay
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Tower questions for the
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
speaker the chair recognizes
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you madam
 
02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you for taking my
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
quick question if the residency
 
02:39:49.469 --> 02:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
requirement was struck from this bill
 
02:39:52.110 --> 02:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
would the bill be
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you for the question if
 
02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:55.269 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you for the question if
the

02:39:55.269 --> 02:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
residency if the residency requirement
 
02:39:59.309 --> 02:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
were struck from the
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
bill um I believe that is the the
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
majority of the bill there's there's
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
some other aspects of the bill that talk
 
02:40:09.389 --> 02:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
about what documentation can be used for
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
establishing residency um but uh the the
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
changing RSA 165 to include a durational
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
residency requirement is the core of
 
02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:22.110 align:start position:0%
residency requirement is the core of
this

02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls Ms Kristen
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
Reynolds followed by Mr Nick
 
02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
Taylor welcome to Municipal and County
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
government hi Kristen Reynolds Swansea U
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing myself uh I moved
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
from Portland Oregon in
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
2022 and at that time the homeless
 
02:40:59.309 --> 02:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
population was
 
02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
incredible the entire downtown of
 
02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
Portland was full of
 
02:41:07.269 --> 02:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
tents in a very nice section of town
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
where we have this beautiful Park full
 
02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.190 align:start position:0%
where we have this beautiful Park full
of

02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
tents the mile in front of the river
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
full of
 
02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
tents the rail trail that everybody like
 
02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
to go on full of tents
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
this was a slow progression because the
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
west coast is known for being very very
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
generous and it was well known by
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
everybody that people were bust in they
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
would it was cheaper for places to just
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
give a bus ticket to somebody and then
 
02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
send them to
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
us and we had an enormous population
 
02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
explosion and as I said tents everywhere
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
that was three years ago my
 
02:41:55.150 --> 02:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
understanding from my friends is that
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
they try to clear out the tents from
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
different areas and then those people go
 
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
to the smaller towns that are
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
so I feel in some ways like I'm from the
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
future it doesn't look right now like
 
02:42:16.269 --> 02:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
that could possibly happen but it didn't
 
02:42:19.469 --> 02:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
look like it could possibly happen
 
02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
10 years before I was in Portland you
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
know before I'm talking about because
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
when I moved to Portland it wasn't like
 
02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
that at
 
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
all so that's all I wanted to say thank
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
you questions for the
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%

the director of housing action New
 
02:42:52.269 --> 02:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are an organization that
 
02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
advocates for policies to increase
 
02:42:56.349 --> 02:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
access to housing our members include
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%

managers homeless service providers and
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
more we're here in opposition to this
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill as you know the committee knows New
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is facing a housing shortage
 
02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
with record low vacancy rates record
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
high costs which is forcing more people
 
02:43:14.190 --> 02:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
to become unhoused and out of their
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
homes uh as has been mentioned the
 
02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
coalition to end homelessness is report
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
found that there's been over 50%
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
increase in homelessness from 2022 to
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
2023 and anecdotally we're hearing the
 
02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
same thing from our members where they
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
are at capacity and having to in some
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
cases turn folks away and doing the very
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
best they can to serve uh their
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
communities and the people in New
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we appreciate the intent you
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
know behind trying to reduce the burden
 
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
on local welfare departments we fully
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
support that and support the efforts to
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
reduce homelessness and and that
 
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
functionally on that in New Hampshire
 
02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
but this bill wouldn't do that it would
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
either delay as been mentioned when the
 
02:43:54.269 --> 02:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
costs get incurred and over those first
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
time period it will still be a cost and
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
still be in need and so it will either
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
get picked up by the soup kitchens and
 
02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
the faith-based organizations and the
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
shelter providers that don't have wiggle
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
room to take in any more folks or take
 
02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
in any more resources or it will be
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
picked up by Municipal law enforcement
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
and EMS and fire departments who are
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
called when emergencies strike because
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
people aren't accessing the funds or are
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
out on the streets so this is just
 
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
shifting around the cost and will have
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
immense damage we believe in terms of
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
the severity and frequency of of
 
02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness and being able to uh
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
support the folks that need the help so
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill happy to take any
 
02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:34.840 align:start position:0%

02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
but homelessness continues to be a
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
critical and growing issue in the state
 
02:45:45.190 --> 02:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so as was discussed um
 
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the numbers uh from the point in
 
02:45:49.269 --> 02:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
time count which is that time in January
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
the 24-hour period where we try and
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
estimate the number of people
 
02:45:54.429 --> 02:45:54.439 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness um is really
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
spiking interestingly today is actually
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
the 2025 count so if I seem a little
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
blur eyed um I've been up since 3:30
 
02:46:01.790 --> 02:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
because I help with the Manchester count
 
02:46:04.349 --> 02:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
this morning um but some additional pick
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
count data for you they talked about
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
people have talked about the 52%
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase that we were the highest
 
02:46:10.269 --> 02:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
increase in the United States between
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
2022 and
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
2023 um and since 2019 chronic or
 
02:46:16.830 --> 02:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
long-term homelessness in New Hampshire
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
has increased uh by over 50% and
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
extremely concerningly the number of New
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents experiencing
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
unsheltered homelessness and so living
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
in a tent during their car for example
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
has nearly quadrupled um between 2019
 
02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:32.550 align:start position:0%
has nearly quadrupled um between 2019
and

02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
2024 uh but amid these spikes the
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 348 would make it
 
02:46:37.870 --> 02:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible for those who are
 
02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
chronically homeless or living
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
unsheltered to access local welfare and
 
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
so it would create this waiting period
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
for accessing welfare support that could
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
literally mean the difference between
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
life and death when it comes to basic
 
02:46:50.910 --> 02:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
needs needs that affect a person's safe
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
safety and health so for example many
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
areas of the state local Welfare Offices
 
02:46:57.389 --> 02:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
play a extremely vital role in helping
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
people access Emergency Shelters and
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
warming centers in frigid weather um so
 
02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know where you're all from but
 
02:47:06.030 --> 02:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
the other morning it was1 in Manchester
 
02:47:08.830 --> 02:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
um when I woke up so um some
 
02:47:11.309 --> 02:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities are over an hour away uh
 
02:47:12.750 --> 02:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
from their nearest emergency shelter
 
02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
with no public transportation available
 
02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
to our residents and so in these cases
 
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
the local welfare office can pay for
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
Trans Transportation cost to the shelter
 
02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the unlikely chance that there's
 
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
actually a bed available um or provide a
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
local Motel voucher as a fatality
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
prevention measure um and so in these
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
situations people can't wait 90 days it
 
02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
is an immediate need um so it may sound
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
overly dramatic but the reality truly is
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
that denying timely access to local
 
02:47:41.950 --> 02:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
welfare support could cost residents
 
02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
lives um prior to being with the
 
02:47:46.349 --> 02:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
Coalition I was a social worker um in
 
02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester for about 20 years um
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
including 10 years with the healthcare
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
for the homeless program doing direct
 
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
social work um in on the streets and in
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
the encampments and so I can speak from
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
lived experience working directly with
 
02:48:00.269 --> 02:48:00.279 align:start position:0%
people that this is this is the truth um
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
deest domestic violence was also
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned um you know having somebody
 
02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
come in and local welfare truly being
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
the last resort um of a a social worker
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
who has sat down for an entire day
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
calling domestic violence shelters that
 
02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
do not have availability for people and
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
local welfare pulling through and being
 
02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
able to put that person in a Hotel say
 
02:48:21.469 --> 02:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
overnight um to provide me more time to
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
be able to to case manage that person
 
02:48:25.630 --> 02:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
and help make those connections um
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
because it you know we do help people
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
get connected with those other services
 
02:48:32.429 --> 02:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
and somebody referred to um other
 
02:48:35.309 --> 02:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
service um other services is cumbersome
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
and it sort of made me smile because
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when talking with clients in
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
the past about applying for local local
 
02:48:44.110 --> 02:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
welfare um they have said I'm not I'm
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
not doing that application um you know
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so um that made me laugh and then
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else also uh mentioned
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
medication support so being able to
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
provide us time to get somebody life a
 
02:48:58.349 --> 02:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
life um a necessary prescription while
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
as a case manager I work with somebody
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
to get them connected with Medicaid um
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
which is not a quick process so again
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes the idea of waiting 90 days is
 
02:49:09.550 --> 02:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
just unfathomable
 
02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:11.230 align:start position:0%
just unfathomable
unfathomable

02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
unfathomable
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that's where I'll
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
leave it so thank you so much for your
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
time and your consideration thank you
 
02:49:17.359 --> 02:49:19.750 align:start position:0%

moment about the impacts of of of local

assistance and and this bill on on Aging
 
02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
adults uh but suffice it to say all all
 
02:50:49.630 --> 02:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
across the life span people depend on
 
02:50:51.229 --> 02:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
local welfare to support their most
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
basic needs when they're at their most
 
02:50:55.309 --> 02:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable this is a Lifeline for people
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
who have lost their jobs lost their
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
homes when they have had a major medical
 
02:51:01.070 --> 02:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
event or as my colleague Miss Stevens
 
02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned when they are coming out of
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
treatment for mental illness or
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder often times these
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
disruptive events force people to need
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
to relocate move in with family members
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
or move to another Community for uh to
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
seek Supportive Housing uh so to require
 
02:51:18.150 --> 02:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
90 days residency or as any residency
 
02:51:20.110 --> 02:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
require as proposed in this bill would
 
02:51:22.229 --> 02:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
effectively deny many individuals as
 
02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
critical assistance exactly when they
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
need it most uh suffice it to say when
 
02:51:30.750 --> 02:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
individuals again those coming out of of
 
02:51:32.269 --> 02:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
mental health or substance use treatment
 
02:51:34.110 --> 02:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
are not able to access local welfare it
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
impacts their access how they're able to
 
02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
access their their medication how
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're able to access uh health care
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
services and where and and certainly
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
impacts their housing stability of
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
course this increases the chance the
 
02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
likelihood of of relapse or recurrence
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh of their their substance use disorder
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
or their mental illness which is
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
obviously something we as a state have
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
worked uh so hard to combat uh in
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the impact of those
 
02:51:57.790 --> 02:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
individuals you have to look at the
 
02:51:59.750 --> 02:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
impacts on families and young children
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh increasing uh uh few food insecurity
 
02:52:04.750 --> 02:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
or housing instability among younger
 
02:52:06.830 --> 02:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
children exposes them to toxic stress or
 
02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences which of
 
02:52:10.510 --> 02:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
course impacts their development
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
throughout their lives uh and with that
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it to Judith to talk about
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
adults thank you so much for your time
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to repeat some of the
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
statistics that you've heard about the
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
Aging population just um what you have
 
02:52:26.590 --> 02:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
heard is the a the population of New
 
02:52:28.910 --> 02:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of Aging adults is increasing
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
poverty in New Hampshire among aging
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
adults is increasing and now we have the
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
rate of homelessness among older
 
02:52:37.229 --> 02:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
individuals increasing we used to see
 
02:52:39.150 --> 02:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
just these as National Trends and now
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're calling them home to New Hampshire
 
02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
local welfare is a critical safety net
 
02:52:46.670 --> 02:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
and as many speakers have talked about
 
02:52:50.110 --> 02:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
it comes at a key time I one example say
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
someone who's had housing consist
 
02:52:55.469 --> 02:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
consistently for 20 years an older adult
 
02:52:58.750 --> 02:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income rent goes
 
02:53:02.349 --> 02:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
up twice unable to maintain that housing
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
and if you you've heard from testimony
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
with other committees the the short the
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
shortage of the housing so someone who's
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
lost their housing an older adult has to
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
move in with a family member under this
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill if my family is taking care of me
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
but I have an urgent need for medication
 
02:53:24.910 --> 02:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
I have no longer any lease proof of live
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
that this person's needs would not be
 
02:53:29.070 --> 02:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
able to be met under this
 
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill older adults often are on fixed
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
incomes and what that means is often a
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
household household of two a married
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
couple can afford the cost of living in
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but what we find is once a
 
02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
spouse dies you're trying to maintain a
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
household on a social security check
 
02:53:51.469 --> 02:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
the average social security check of
 
02:53:54.229 --> 02:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
January n January
 
02:53:58.590 --> 02:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
2025 is $1900 a month in the written
 
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
material you'll find a link to something
 
02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
called elder index and it will tell you
 
02:54:05.550 --> 02:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of living for older adults in
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
each county in the United States so you
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
can look up chesher you can look up
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro you can look up Rockingham and
 
02:54:15.309 --> 02:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of living over
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
$2,800 chesher in the $3,000 Hills B in
 
02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:19.630 align:start position:0%
$2,800 chesher in the $3,000 Hills B in
the

02:54:19.630 --> 02:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
$3,000 Rockingham just knowing this is
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
what the older population is facing we
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um our association opposes the
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill as initially
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
written uh since our association learned
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill about two week and a
 
02:56:33.030 --> 02:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
half two weeks ago um I have been in
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
communication with representative
 
02:56:38.590 --> 02:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
RADS um and it that has been much
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated um also we also appreciate
 
02:56:43.750 --> 02:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
her sensitivity to
 
02:56:45.790 --> 02:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um I have been in
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
communication with legal aid with NH HMA
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
we we all met um in a room prior to the
 
02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:53.479 align:start position:0%
session holding hands maybe not holding
 
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
hands but you know we we discussed the
 
02:56:59.309 --> 02:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh that was of value uh due
 
02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
to our collaboration the language has
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
been in flux uh including up to as I
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
said about an hour ago um we agree our
 
02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
association agrees that continuous
 
02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement is important including
 
02:57:15.870 --> 02:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
during Changing Times um and we welcome
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
discussions we believe the initial uh
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
unamended Bill uh to have been
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
unworkable with too many unintended
 
02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
consequences including the 90 days for
 
02:57:30.269 --> 02:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
residency criteria and it was brought up
 
02:57:32.349 --> 02:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
earlier and that was a excellent example
 
02:57:35.229 --> 02:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
someone from Rochester could potentially
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily with no assistance move to
 
02:57:39.950 --> 02:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
conquered two and a half months later
 
02:57:42.349 --> 02:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
potentially need oil and they would
 
02:57:44.429 --> 02:57:44.439 align:start position:0%
potentially go back to the city of
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
Rochester um for it so these logistic um
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh challenges would exist and I and I do
 
02:57:52.349 --> 02:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
believe that they were unintended by the
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
way uh the consensus of our board uh and
 
02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
I should say that I have um gauged many
 
02:57:59.309 --> 02:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
welfare officials throughout the state
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
since I've learned of this uh including
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
our board of directors the consensus is
 
02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:04.309 align:start position:0%
our board of directors the consensus is
one

02:58:04.309 --> 02:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
day the current law one day perhaps Too
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
Short however 90 days is too long again
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
unworkable to navigate and with harm and
 
02:58:16.590 --> 02:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
with likely harm um 30 days with was the
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
consensus um but with Safeguard language
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
to temporarily assist people with an
 
02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
urgent emergency need regardless of town
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
of origin until the welfare official can
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
communicate and coordinate with other
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that language was put
 
02:58:33.550 --> 02:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the word was sh in the S sp10 and I
 
02:58:35.469 --> 02:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
will say and I've talked to welfare
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
officials throughout the state that law
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
has been very beneficial um the focus
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
was um homeless shelters correction
 
02:58:45.309 --> 02:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
facilities hospitals uh that they do not
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
con they no longer constitute residency
 
02:58:49.630 --> 02:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
for local welfare purposes that just
 
02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
simply made sense this bill here is much
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
broader um again with some concerning um
 
02:59:00.590 --> 02:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
um sections to it um I will also say
 
02:59:02.830 --> 02:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
that um the vast majority of the folks
 
02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%

requirement and creates a that is
 
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
workable or will it include the
 
03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:54.110 align:start position:0%
workable or will it include the
residency

03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.429 --> 03:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
requirement I hope that in our
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%

if it is 30 days um that for our

association to um support it it would
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
need to have that Safeguard language uh
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
of temporary assisting people uh that uh
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%

we can coordinate them um um um um to
 
03:01:23.229 --> 03:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
their town of
 
03:01:26.229 --> 03:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
origin further
 
03:01:28.830 --> 03:01:28.840 align:start position:0%

and you also um I don't know if it was
 
03:01:52.030 --> 03:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
intentional but
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
didn't um indicate your position if you
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
want would you like to amend that was
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
that an oversight I no it was not an
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
oversight um because I'm a nonpartisan
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%

03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
stabilization homeless prevention fund
 
03:02:33.630 --> 03:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh today is the national HUD
 
03:02:35.710 --> 03:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
point in time homeless persons count
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's like a census for those
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness and I uh I
 
03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
apologize uh for my appearance uh but
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
I've been outside in the woods working
 
03:02:44.590 --> 03:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
with people who are
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
suffering um local control is not
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
working many other states at this uh at
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
this point uh have handed this over to
 
03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
the county
 
03:02:59.550 --> 03:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
um I have many elderly uh participants
 
03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
families uh living in their vehicles uh
 
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
because local welfare and other homeless
 
03:03:09.630 --> 03:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
prevention uh mechanisms are uh have
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
have failed uh and we do not have enough
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
shelter per capita um the 90-day element
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh will exclude many of our most
 
03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable community members I'm talking
 
03:03:24.990 --> 03:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
about your grandmothers um and uh
 
03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.870 align:start position:0%
about your grandmothers um and uh
children

03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:03:30.030 --> 03:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
um domestic violence shelters and cold
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
weather shelters respectfully are full
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
they do the best they can with uh the
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
resources they have um and many of those
 
03:03:40.349 --> 03:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
I work with are literally excluded from
 
03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
accessing the shelters due to screening
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
questions like can you reach a top bunk
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
I can tell you right now if you answer
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
no to that question when being screened
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
you will not get a bed
 
03:03:53.469 --> 03:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
um and that's if shelter is available
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
the conquered cold weather shelter to my
 
03:03:56.910 --> 03:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge I work closely with their team
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
has been full um the Isaiah 60 Cafe
 
03:04:03.030 --> 03:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
Isaiah 61 Cafe in my catchment which is
 
03:04:05.950 --> 03:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
a cold weather shelter is almost always
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
full um or close to it if they have more
 
03:04:12.269 --> 03:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
than three to five beds it's unusual um
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
homeless prevention funds like these
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
that I oversee are over taxed and
 
03:04:19.990 --> 03:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
underresourced is my calendar year for
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
my homeless prevention program runs from
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
July 1st to June 30th last year so My my
 
03:04:30.190 --> 03:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
year will end this June 30th of 2025 I
 
03:04:32.910 --> 03:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
ran out of money to prevent homelessness
 
03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
because of the need right now um in
 
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
October of last year okay and uh and
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're not getting any additional funds
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
so right now local welfare is the safety
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
net people are dying because I have no
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
place to put them
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
I understand as a taxpayer I've owned a
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
home in Manchester since 2003 and have
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
been a lifelong resident of New
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was also a homeless college
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
student at
 
03:05:01.070 --> 03:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
19 we can do a lot better than we're
 
03:05:04.510 --> 03:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
doing changing these laws to make things
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
more restrictive and give people more
 
03:05:08.590 --> 03:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
reasons to look for an answer to say no
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
is not the answer we need to be looking
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
for reasons to say yes help should be
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
easy to get and hard to keep um so I
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
fully support everything was just saying
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%

03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%

03:06:39.389 --> 03:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
are available you have the Lakes Region
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Organization you have an
 
03:06:46.630 --> 03:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
office of cap that comes up you have uh
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
we have three
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
to uh homeless shelters that work within
 
03:06:55.950 --> 03:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
this organization we have a uh a house
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
for uh ladies who have had violence
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
against them and are other uh medical
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
issues we have that available within our
 
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
town uh now we've also had a large
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
transient population that has uh over
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
the last three years in flowed and
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
within that if you looked at the budget
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the City of
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
Laconia uh three or year three years ago
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
maybe four it was a
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
$40,000 line item in the budget and it
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
was pretty stable throughout all the
 
03:07:38.830 --> 03:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
years and then we started seeing it
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
creep it creeped up this past year it's
 
03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:45.469 align:start position:0%
creep it creeped up this past year it's
approaching

03:07:45.469 --> 03:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and it's going to be for the
 
03:07:51.550 --> 03:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
proposed budget I'm suspecting to see it
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
well over
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to provide the services that
 
03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
are being
 
03:08:02.910 --> 03:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
suggested uh by the current language in
 
03:08:07.229 --> 03:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
the bill this the cities have no
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
resource other than to pass this on to
 
03:08:13.150 --> 03:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
03:08:16.269 --> 03:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
owners now a lot of people are sitting
 
03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
here talking about
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
housing and people are being pushed out
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
of their housing because of rent
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
increases one must ask themselves what
 
03:08:30.750 --> 03:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
is a primary cause of house increase or
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
the rent
 
03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
increase I'll I'll help answer that that
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
is called increase in your property tax
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
now what's going to go to help increase
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
your property tax is your welfare line
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
so every time you've got a a group of
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
folks who are living on the
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
edge okay and what happens is you're
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to raise the property the the
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
property tax and as property tax raises
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
the owner of that property is not going
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
to eat it because they still have to
 
03:09:07.389 --> 03:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
make their margin because that's what
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're in business for so they pass on
 
03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:12.990 align:start position:0%
they're in business for so they pass on
that

03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
increase to the renters of that building
 
03:09:19.550 --> 03:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
now you you're going to have people who
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
could afford it yesterday could afford
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
to pay for it just barely now they've
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
been pushed off the edge so
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
we yes we have increased
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
homelessness by trying to fix problems
 
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
every time we try to fix a problem and
 
03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
pass it on to the local municipalities
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
to fix it then that increases the
 
03:09:49.870 --> 03:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
property tax ta so if we really want to
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
feel good about
 
03:09:56.110 --> 03:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves then maybe the state should
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
take on the responsibility of paying for
 
03:10:02.910 --> 03:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of welfare that they want to
 
03:10:06.190 --> 03:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
offer the original welfare wasn't set up
 
03:10:09.710 --> 03:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
to help transits as they move in and out
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
of cities and take advantage of the
 
03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
different situations in welfare for each
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
Town it was set up to help their locals
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
as a family fell on Hard Times the town
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
could come in and they could help them
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
get across the hump get across that bump
 
03:10:31.150 --> 03:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's what a lot of people need is
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
shortterm help to get across the bridge
 
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:37.880 align:start position:0%

HB what is it

488 um does not address that particular
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
conflict but is a broader stroke um
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
encompassing more boards and Municipal
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%

03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Madame chairman and
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
frock um would you say there's a
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
difference between a municipal board and
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
a land use
 
03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
board they are both Municipal
 
03:55:08.590 --> 03:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
boards um a land use board has a
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
specific function it deals with land
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
use um another board board um I can't
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
think of a name uh but the name would
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:28.229 --> 03:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
board the chair recognizes
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for a question
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair is there a
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
possibility write an amendment to put HB
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
448 um that would certainly be Poss
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
possible but not
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
advisable and the reason it would not be
 
03:55:51.550 --> 03:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
advisable is because it's in a
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
completely different section of the
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
rsas uh HB 92 deals specifically with
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
powers of planning boards and zoning
 
03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
boards and that's found in 673 and
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
674 and the reason that the amendment is
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
being proposed is to make 100% certain
 
03:56:17.950 --> 03:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
that people who are on those boards
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand the need to um recuse
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and not have a a
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
conflict thank you you're further
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing none thank you for
 
03:56:36.149 --> 03:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
your excellent Bill introduction thank
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
03:56:40.269 --> 03:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
chair also um I would ask that you fill
 
03:56:46.750 --> 03:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
next the chair recognizes representative
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard to speak on the bill
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair and
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable committee members uh
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Heath Howard I
 
03:57:07.149 --> 03:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of straford and
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
barington in straford District 4 uh I'm
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
appearing in front of you today because
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to hb4 as it is currently
 
03:57:17.309 --> 03:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
ridden because of the effect that the
 
03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
legislation will have on my town uh the
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
town of straford has one person serving
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
in uh the positions of both Town Clerk
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
and tax collector it is our belief that
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
this could pose an issue as finding
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
qualified people who are willing and
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
able to serve in both positions can be
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
difficult uh after having a uh an email
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
conversation with both representative
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and our uh town clerk uh and
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
tax collector uh there was kind of a
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion proposed in my opinion it
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
would be far less honorous and would
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
allow still allow for the goal of the
 
03:57:50.830 --> 03:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to be accomplished if an
 
03:57:53.070 --> 03:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to remove the term if
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
authorized as provided in RSA 41
 
03:58:02.349 --> 03:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
45- from page one line 8 is uh is
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
removed uh with that being said uh I'm
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
03:58:15.309 --> 03:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
Guthrie for a question
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair in in the bill and thank you for
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the bill under C
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
says no full-time employee or department
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
head shall at the same time hold the
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
office of
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
selectman uh I can see some maybe minor
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
problems with the department head but
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
could you tell me why a full-time
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
employee of a town maybe somebody who's
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
working for the Board of Public Works uh
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know a maintenance person would not
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
be able to have a selectman if he could
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
get elected uh that that's not what I'm
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to uh specifically I'm in
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to uh Part B so that would be
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh part I section B no Town Clerk or
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
Deputy town clerk May hold any other
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
elected appointed or appointed office
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
other than tax collector if authorized
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
as provided in RSA
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
4145 or Deputy tax
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
collector uh and so after my
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
spillsbury uh through via email it was
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
suggested that uh if we struck the the
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
term if authorized as provided in RSA 41
 
03:59:33.630 --> 03:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
45- A that would be uh beneficial
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
because uh right now 41 uh 45 UHA what
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
that does is it requires approval uh by
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
the town in the form of a vote so uh in
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the town of straford we have
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
a town meeting day so we would have to
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
hold a vote uh every time to uh to
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that our town clerk uh can be
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
our our um our tax collector as well
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your information
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may Madam chair probably asked
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
the question by somebody who has an
 
04:00:08.110 --> 04:00:08.120 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%

04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%

04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily work our
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
association requested our legal
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%

04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
if um I would I would you could speak to
 
04:01:38.670 --> 04:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
the ideas okay that's I want you to
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide um testimony but you can
 
04:01:42.000 --> 04:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
provide um testimony but you can
certainly

04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:01:47.309 --> 04:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
so he um so we're primarily focusing on
 
04:01:49.389 --> 04:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
the prohibition in lines 7 through eight
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill no Town Clerk or Deputy town
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
clerk May hold any other elected or
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
appointed office other than tax
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
collector if authorized as provided in
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
RSA 41 colon
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
45- or Deputy tax collector it is
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
unclear why the bill singles out clerks
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
and deputies no other person is
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
subjected to this blanket Prohibition in
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
small New Hampshire towns there simply
 
04:02:15.309 --> 04:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
are non people to serve in local
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
government this bill makes the problem
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
worse in one town that is um rep one in
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
one town the town clerk is the fire
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
chief they would no longer be able to do
 
04:02:29.309 --> 04:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
that in another town the town clerk is
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator that would no
 
04:02:34.510 --> 04:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
longer be allowed so we're we're talking
 
04:02:37.630 --> 04:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that's just two examples of um many
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
others that are out there where this
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
would create a hardship for those for
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
those towns
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
um one very strange uh result of this
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill is that ital it this would prohibit
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
a town clerk from also serving as a
 
04:02:56.349 --> 04:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
school clerk we have
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
multiple uh situations where that I
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
myself I was the Town Clerk and the
 
04:03:03.990 --> 04:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
school clerk for years I'm not presently
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
but I have been um and because we do
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
similar jobs the school Clerk and town
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
clerk it makes sense for for the town
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
clerk to be able to also Ser as school
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
clerk um there is an RSA 31 colon
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
39a um that the town meeting May adopt
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
an ordinance establishing
 
04:03:27.630 --> 04:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
incompatibility of office requirements
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
stricter than those specified by the law
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
towns can already do that and I've also
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
supplied a copy so towns can can go to
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
town meeting and they can make stricter
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
laws than what exist in
 
04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
669 um colon
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
7 and finally um it is the um legal
 
04:03:50.880 --> 04:03:52.389 align:start position:0%
7 and finally um it is the um legal
council's

04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
council's
 
04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
um opinion that this bill May violate
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
part one article 11 of the New Hampshire
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution which states in part every
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state having the
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
proper qualifications has equal right to
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
be elected into office presumably some
 
04:04:11.469 --> 04:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable limitations on this right are
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable such as the prohibition to
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
discussed above on a Town employee
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
serving as selectman or the prohibition
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
on serving as both selectman and
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
moderator however HB 488 would Pro
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit a town clerk or Deputy clerk
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
from holding any other elected office
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
except for tax collector this broad
 
04:04:35.149 --> 04:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
prohibition may very well violate the
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
constitution and um with that I'm open
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
to any questions anybody might
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none and may I submit this I also
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
have a letter from the Woodstock select
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
board so what is it that you're
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
submitting um a letter from the
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
Woodstock select board and then the um
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
our um the attorney's our New Hampshire
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
City and town clerk's legal council's
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
488 could you just hold for one second
 
04:05:10.520 --> 04:05:30.750 align:start position:0%
488 could you just hold for one second
sure

04:05:30.750 --> 04:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're checking on something so um just
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
if you might not if you would like to
 
04:05:38.189 --> 04:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
hold that's fine um this Bill had come
 
04:05:41.710 --> 04:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
up last year and um and the basically
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
the same letter had been submitted to
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
the senent it at the
 
04:06:28.990 --> 04:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
so while I'm waiting for an answer from
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
clerk we I'll direct you as to to to
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
what you need to do with regards to what
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
you have in your hand okay so that it's
 
04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
the last pink card that I have so I will
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
ask is there anyone present who wishes
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill who has not yet
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to do
 
04:06:55.389 --> 04:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
so okay seeing seeing none we will
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
report out the blue sheet at this
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
time uh Madam chair I have nothing from
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
any handwritten blue sheet I remotely
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
there is one in support and 26 in
 
04:07:07.399 --> 04:07:24.990 align:start position:0%
there is one in support and 26 in
opposition

04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
okay let me correct that we had three
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
three in opposition on the blue sheet
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
Miss Dari do do you have written
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
testimony of your
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
fine no you don't need to
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
um why don't you just put put the the
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
testimony as communication to the
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee right there or at the end of
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
the table yep and then we will um sort
 
04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:23.389 align:start position:0%
the table yep and then we will um sort
that

04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%

04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and we will come back here at

05:21:40.840 --> 05:21:44.910 align:start position:0%

05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
84 allowing Miss municipalities to

05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%

ities the chair would like to recognize
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you uh Mr chairman I'd like
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%

05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
discussion the chair recognizes repres
 
05:22:54.548 --> 05:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
representative maiori thank you
 
05:22:56.990 --> 05:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairwoman you know I think we kind of
 
05:22:57.000 --> 05:22:57.628 align:start position:0%
chairwoman you know I think we kind of
get

05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
it we have an issue here but there are
 
05:23:04.350 --> 05:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place as a matter of fact
 
05:23:04.360 --> 05:23:06.230 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place as a matter of fact
RSA

05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
82 says that it's a misdemeanor real
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
estate mov and a tax bill has not been
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
paid there are mechanisms where these
 
05:23:18.750 --> 05:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
folks U where that money can be recouped
 
05:23:21.150 --> 05:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
but even more than that what this build
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
sets up is a situation where a
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
campground owner becomes a tax collector
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
and even if that were practical there's
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for the collection or for
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
the uh for the for for Distributing that
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
money back to the town so given that
 
05:23:43.390 --> 05:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
there is a way for the municipality to
 
05:23:47.070 --> 05:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
recoup and there is no clearly defined
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
way practical way for the owner to to to
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
effectuate this bill uh I I don't think
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
that this is practical and support the
 
05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
itl maret thank you I didn't turn my mic
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.628 --> 05:24:07.638 align:start position:0%
that that's okay um the chair rep the
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
chair recog izes representative
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
Walker yes uh thank you madam chair uh I
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
think 84 would solve a lot of lot of
 
05:24:20.390 --> 05:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
problems that are going along with RVs
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
and municipalities especially like in
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
Rochester and the $200 fee in place of
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
real estate tax would probably be a
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
great idea but there's just too many
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
holes elsewhere that things can fall
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
through or not get done so I'm in
 
05:24:38.670 --> 05:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
support of itl
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion before
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%

05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
revisit this in about 5 years when the
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
postal rates go up and a lot of towns
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%

you madam chair very good um as I said
 
05:37:46.030 --> 05:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
in my spare time I chair the planning
 
05:37:49.470 --> 05:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
board in my town which is Enfield and
 
05:37:52.110 --> 05:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
I've done so for
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
probably six or seven years um the bill
 
05:37:57.760 --> 05:37:59.548 align:start position:0%
probably six or seven years um the bill
as

05:37:59.548 --> 05:37:59.558 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
introduced wants to prohibit an
 
05:38:04.390 --> 05:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
individual from serving on both a
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
planning board and a zoning board and
 
05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is there can be
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
occasions when a member is uh sitting on
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
both boards would be making a decision
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
on or ruling on an appeal to a decision
 
05:38:28.670 --> 05:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
that he or she has already made as a
 
05:38:31.510 --> 05:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
member of a planning board for those of
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
you who are not familiar with the land
 
05:38:34.878 --> 05:38:36.270 align:start position:0%
you who are not familiar with the land
use

05:38:36.270 --> 05:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
process uh um if an applicant wants to
 
05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
do a project he may start out with the
 
05:38:46.548 --> 05:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
zoning board seeking a variance or a
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
special exception the applicant then may
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
go to the planning board if it's a
 
05:38:56.310 --> 05:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
commercial uh situation or a subdivision
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
the planning board may send him back to
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
the zoning board for yet another um
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
zoning variance or special
 
05:39:08.548 --> 05:39:08.558 align:start position:0%
exception uh then might go back to the
 
05:39:11.310 --> 05:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
planning board and it can bounce back
 
05:39:11.320 --> 05:39:12.110 align:start position:0%
planning board and it can bounce back
and

05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
forth uh the final decision of the
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
planning board can then be appealed to
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
the zoning board and when that happens
 
05:39:25.628 --> 05:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
we feel it's a conflict of interest for
 
05:39:29.468 --> 05:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
an individual to be taking part in an
 
05:39:29.478 --> 05:39:30.590 align:start position:0%
an individual to be taking part in an
appeal

05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
05:39:35.230 --> 05:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
decision that he was initially part of
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
making so what we propose and by we uh
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh Amendment representative
 
05:39:48.510 --> 05:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
Elward and I work together to draft
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
this and what we propose is in when such
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
a situation arises the individual recuse
 
05:40:00.990 --> 05:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
himself from the zoning board when they
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
have their deliberations on the appeal
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that solves the problem it allows
 
05:40:11.830 --> 05:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
a person to sit on both boards in a town
 
05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
where it may be difficult to find enough
 
05:40:18.590 --> 05:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
people to fill all of the available
 
05:40:23.468 --> 05:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
slots and we think it's a a very good
 
05:40:29.070 --> 05:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and will help the process
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
of developing or not developing as the
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
case may be certain properties in the
 
05:40:35.840 --> 05:40:41.070 align:start position:0%
case may be certain properties in the
state

05:40:41.070 --> 05:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:44.230 --> 05:40:44.240 align:start position:0%

explanation um comments discussion the
 
05:40:55.150 --> 05:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Madame
 
05:41:01.390 --> 05:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um representative frock and I
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
worked on this amendment and I think
 
05:41:07.948 --> 05:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
it's his first amendment my my
 
05:41:11.110 --> 05:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
second um
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately crawling up and over the
 
05:41:13.360 --> 05:41:14.350 align:start position:0%
unfortunately crawling up and over the
learning

05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
curve we didn't uh run this by the New
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association who
 
05:41:20.040 --> 05:41:21.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association who
pointed

05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
pointed
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
out um elements of the amended language
 
05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
that is is not not ready for prime time
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so I cannot support this amendment
 
05:41:39.430 --> 05:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
in its current um um
 
05:41:39.440 --> 05:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
in its current um um
condition

05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:41:45.510 --> 05:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
um basically it conflicts with uh other
 
05:41:48.868 --> 05:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
types of local land use boards such as
 
05:41:48.878 --> 05:41:50.628 align:start position:0%
types of local land use boards such as
the

05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
um what are those commissions that are
 
05:41:55.708 --> 05:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
defined in
 
05:41:59.310 --> 05:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
statute and so the the the wording local
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
land use boards in the amended
 
05:42:02.400 --> 05:42:04.628 align:start position:0%
land use boards in the amended
language

05:42:04.628 --> 05:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
um needs to be specified as a zba and
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
the planning board uh to make it work so
 
05:42:18.190 --> 05:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.830 --> 05:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
otpa further comments representative
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
Walker yeah I've uh spent uh 15 years on
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
this Rochester's planning board and it
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
was always been a no no for someone to
 
05:42:33.030 --> 05:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
serve on the planning board and the
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
zoning board for the reasons being
 
05:42:38.430 --> 05:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
discussed and just because recuses or
 
05:42:40.628 --> 05:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
that person recuses themselves they're
 
05:42:43.230 --> 05:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
still on the board and can sway votes
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
and it's very not a good optic for the
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
people that come in and get say denied
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
for variance or a uh a a plan and then
 
05:42:55.990 --> 05:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
go to the appeal to the zoning board and
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the same guy that denied you sitting on
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
that board not maybe not voting but
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
sitting just bad Optics and we've always
 
05:43:04.990 --> 05:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
had a rule that no one can serve on both
 
05:43:07.628 --> 05:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
those boards in Rochester anyway
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:12.948 --> 05:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
ma'am additional
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
comments repres oh representative
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
Elward just for clarification
 
05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative Walker um we were
 
05:43:24.030 --> 05:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
responding to concerns I think brought
 
05:43:26.910 --> 05:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
by representative Gilman that many of
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
the some of these very small towns um
 
05:43:34.510 --> 05:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
can't populate their boards and
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes have to put
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
people on on
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
both just to let you
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
know thank you further comments the
 
05:43:49.070 --> 05:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative majori
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman
 
05:43:53.788 --> 05:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm a co-sponsor on the on the
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
underlying bill so the the overarching
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
principle I I certainly support I I I
 
05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
question though the language that OS has
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
has given us here it says the individual
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
shall recuse him or herself from voting
 
05:44:08.948 --> 05:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
on matters pre viously decided on by
 
05:44:08.958 --> 05:44:09.948 align:start position:0%
on matters pre viously decided on by
another

05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
board on which he or she is an alternate
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
member and I wonder I'm on the Heritage
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
commission which has demo review and
 
05:44:19.468 --> 05:44:19.478 align:start position:0%
while the Heritage commission is
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
advisory I'm the select board
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative to the planning board
 
05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
which means that would I have to recuse
 
05:44:30.628 --> 05:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
myself from a vote on the planning board
 
05:44:32.468 --> 05:44:32.478 align:start position:0%
because I'm on the Heritage commission
 
05:44:34.430 --> 05:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
and while we might not have an answer to
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
that I think the language that has been
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
presented it to us makes me question
 
05:44:42.788 --> 05:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not I'm right or if that may
 
05:44:45.390 --> 05:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
if that may exist so I still like the
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
idea I just don't know that this
 
05:44:50.510 --> 05:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
be no disrespect I think this is the
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
language they gave us so sorry further
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%

05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%

05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is it possible I know we have
 
05:49:26.510 --> 05:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
to take a vote we have a motion to
 
05:49:29.350 --> 05:49:29.360 align:start position:0%

the the vote on this bill to try to work
 
05:49:34.750 --> 05:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
on something if that be the the opinion
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the majority of the board uh of our
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative majori I I do
 
05:49:43.390 --> 05:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
believe that that that is
 
05:49:43.400 --> 05:49:45.310 align:start position:0%
believe that that that is
correct

05:49:45.310 --> 05:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:49:47.910 --> 05:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
um could I like to speak to
 
05:50:23.390 --> 05:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.590 --> 05:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.548 --> 05:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay so I just um conferred with the the
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
ranking member on the um proposal by the
 
05:51:50.590 --> 05:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
deputy ranking member with regards to
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill so we have a motion before us
 
05:51:57.868 --> 05:51:57.878 align:start position:0%
which we need to dispose of we need to
 
05:51:59.830 --> 05:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
take a vote on
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
that so what I can do is if the itl
 
05:52:07.680 --> 05:52:08.708 align:start position:0%
that so what I can do is if the itl
motion

05:52:08.708 --> 05:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%

and the
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
members can work on an amendment and we
 
05:52:27.948 --> 05:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
can exact this bill at a
 
05:52:27.958 --> 05:52:30.110 align:start position:0%

05:52:47.070 --> 05:52:47.080 align:start position:0%

for disabled
 
05:55:43.150 --> 05:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
veterans at this point I would like to
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to House Bill 99 and
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment number is 2025
 
05:55:49.760 --> 05:55:56.708 align:start position:0%
the amendment number is 2025
0045

05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:01.590 --> 05:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
H second do I yeah do I have a second
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative gerana second thank you
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.430 --> 05:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to speak to to my Amendment
 
05:56:15.750 --> 05:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
so the the bill as written would allow
 
05:56:17.708 --> 05:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
optional disabled veterans tax credit to
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
cover um up to this is enabling
 
05:56:33.150 --> 05:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
legislation 100% of the property
 
05:56:36.310 --> 05:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
tax this bill came before this committee
 
05:56:40.390 --> 05:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
language 100% is it's unworkable that is
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
not obviously a fixed number and there
 
05:56:53.868 --> 05:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
are concerns with with that
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
specification of a percentage
 
05:57:02.110 --> 05:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
because the property tax exemption if
 
05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
that were to become law and this
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
optional tax credit were to be adopted
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
by a
 
05:57:16.628 --> 05:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
town that tax credit would be different
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
for different veterans who qualified for
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
the tax credit because
 
05:57:27.070 --> 05:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
each Veteran's
 
05:57:27.080 --> 05:57:29.390 align:start position:0%
each Veteran's
property

05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:57:33.670 --> 05:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
is valuated differently so that's a
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
have let me just let me speak to the
 
05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
amendment so what my
 
05:57:48.718 --> 05:57:50.750 align:start position:0%
amendment so what my
Amendment

05:57:50.750 --> 05:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:57:52.788 --> 05:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
does is
 
05:57:56.430 --> 05:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
that it changes the the the maximum
 
05:58:01.310 --> 05:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and to me that's that's a
 
05:58:04.958 --> 05:58:07.190 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and to me that's that's a
reasonable

05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment change to this particular
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
statute because the last time that that
 
05:58:20.548 --> 05:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
dollar amount was
 
05:58:27.150 --> 05:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.150 --> 05:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
20 it was some time ago so I think it
 
05:58:39.708 --> 05:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
was in 2018 18 there there was a bill to
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
um increase
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
it yes so my notes Here say that it was
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
changed to the $4,000 amount in May of
 
05:58:52.990 --> 05:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
2018 there was a bill and it became
 
05:58:56.230 --> 05:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
effective January 2019 so the point
 
05:58:59.310 --> 05:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
being is that um I thought that it would
 
05:59:02.670 --> 05:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
be reasonable to adjust that upper
 
05:59:05.350 --> 05:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
maximum allowable credit from the 4,000
 
05:59:09.548 --> 05:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
to the 5000 ,000 to uh take into account
 
05:59:09.558 --> 05:59:11.350 align:start position:0%
to the 5000 ,000 to uh take into account
in

05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
inflation Additionally you see that I
 
05:59:18.670 --> 05:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
added the words permanent and on line
 
05:59:22.350 --> 05:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
four as well as line six and the reason
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
that I thought that that was important
 
05:59:28.030 --> 05:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
because when you take this
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
um optional tax
 
05:59:34.750 --> 05:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
credit specified in statute under Roman
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
numeral 1A in you put it into the
 
05:59:39.788 --> 05:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
context of
 
05:59:43.150 --> 05:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
72 colon
 
05:59:46.750 --> 05:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
35 it uses the language permanent and
 
05:59:46.760 --> 05:59:47.708 align:start position:0%
35 it uses the language permanent and
total

05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
total
 
05:59:52.030 --> 05:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
disability and somehow that that
 
05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
language got dropped and it probably
 
05:59:58.628 --> 05:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
got I'm I'm assuming that it probably
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
got dropped um when there was a
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill when there was a bill to change 1A
 
06:00:07.510 --> 06:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
and I think think that it's important
 
06:00:12.430 --> 06:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
for clarity and understanding for um
 
06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.110 --> 06:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
um go to adopt or they're um offering
 
06:00:24.708 --> 06:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
this tax credit that that that it's
 
06:00:26.708 --> 06:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
consistent so that that's the rationale
 
06:00:29.150 --> 06:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
for adding that language in and then
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
lastly the I have additional language on
 
06:00:32.638 --> 06:00:33.628 align:start position:0%
lastly the I have additional language on
line

06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
line
 
06:00:38.270 --> 06:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
seven that and it specifies three
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
different four different um other tax
 
06:00:47.468 --> 06:00:47.478 align:start position:0%
credits and the reason that I I did that
 
06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
is to
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
prevent the stacking of of various tax
 
06:00:59.110 --> 06:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
credits so
 
06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to run into a
 
06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
situation where perhaps uh uh an indiv
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
idual in the town who may apply may be

are good um but there are many many
 
06:09:34.990 --> 06:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill we have seen
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
bills like this come before our
 
06:09:40.190 --> 06:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee in years past and kind of the
 
06:09:42.990 --> 06:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
gold standard for judging tax exemption
 
06:09:44.910 --> 06:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
bills is a means
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
testing um standard there is none in
 
06:09:51.110 --> 06:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
this bill all you have to do is reach
 
06:09:55.788 --> 06:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
the um very very very Advanced age of 72
 
06:09:57.868 --> 06:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
and you no longer have to pay any
 
06:10:01.230 --> 06:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes whatsoever even if you
 
06:10:04.190 --> 06:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
are the CEO of a major multinational
 
06:10:06.628 --> 06:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
company and you live in a $2 million
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
mansion and make $3 billion a year and
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is no mechanism in the bill to um
 
06:10:16.150 --> 06:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
say to the state
 
06:10:18.590 --> 06:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
um that you could very well afford to
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
pay your property taxes and so on that
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
technical basis and philosophical basis
 
06:10:28.270 --> 06:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
both of those alike I I would recommend
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%

06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
of money some of us are well off and
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
some of us many of us are left with a
 
06:11:10.270 --> 06:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
sing being a single person with only
 
06:11:12.468 --> 06:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
Social Security and I think we really
 
06:11:15.110 --> 06:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to help them and most towns are
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
already doing that we increased in my
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
town we increased the parameters and we
 
06:11:24.190 --> 06:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
are doing it uh assisting people who are
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
70 years old uh and U um are really
 
06:11:32.670 --> 06:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can to help our our
 
06:11:35.548 --> 06:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
seniors with low income so I think is
 
06:11:38.750 --> 06:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
there but this is a poorly written B
 
06:11:43.708 --> 06:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%

101 at this time I will open the
 
06:14:11.030 --> 06:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
110 authorizing counties to establish
 
06:14:19.150 --> 06:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.160 --> 06:14:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
accounts

06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
06:14:25.590 --> 06:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
so in front of you you see a um a
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
handout that's stapled and it's quite
 
06:14:32.150 --> 06:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:35.350 --> 06:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
right there
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
I myself and representative
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
stavis and potentially
 
06:14:44.750 --> 06:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
others worked
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
on language for an amendment to this
 
06:14:52.670 --> 06:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill so just very briefly I'm going to
 
06:14:56.350 --> 06:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
explain what this long handout is so the
 
06:15:00.310 --> 06:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee researcher was um kind
 
06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
enough to provide at my request a a side
 
06:15:11.468 --> 06:15:11.478 align:start position:0%
by side by side comparison on the Fly um
 
06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
with regards to the the the two
 
06:15:16.510 --> 06:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
different amendments and the bill as
 
06:15:20.670 --> 06:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
introduced so at this point in time I
 
06:15:22.350 --> 06:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
offer Amendment
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
2025 57h to House Bill 110 is there a
 
06:15:36.190 --> 06:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
second second represent Murphy seconds
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
06:15:38.638 --> 06:15:43.350 align:start position:0%
that thank
you

06:15:43.350 --> 06:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:43.360 --> 06:15:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:15:45.390 --> 06:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:48.510 --> 06:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
so again just very briefly the the
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're considering here
 
06:15:54.590 --> 06:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
right now is 0057 H and as you recall
 
06:15:58.990 --> 06:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
from the hearing on the bill that there
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.920 --> 06:16:03.708 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

06:16:03.708 --> 06:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:16:06.830 --> 06:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
subsequently the Prime sponsor got
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
together with stakeholders and worked on
 
06:16:12.750 --> 06:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
an additional Amendment and so right off
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
the bat what I noticed is that the
 
06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're
 
06:16:19.350 --> 06:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
considering looks a lot like the
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
original bill as
 
06:16:21.360 --> 06:16:23.310 align:start position:0%
original bill as
written

06:16:23.310 --> 06:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:16:27.670 --> 06:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to point out the the changes
 
06:16:32.350 --> 06:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
that that I um pointed out and that that
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
are in this particular Amendment and the
 
06:16:37.350 --> 06:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
changes were to
 
06:16:41.708 --> 06:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
address uh language in the the the bill
 
06:16:44.788 --> 06:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that that needed some
 
06:16:47.310 --> 06:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
adjustment so the first thing that that
 
06:16:51.030 --> 06:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
you can will note is throughout the bill
 
06:16:52.390 --> 06:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
on line
 
06:16:58.708 --> 06:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
six um line seven I mean line
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
20 you will notice the the the
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
word County delegation for legislative
 
06:17:10.390 --> 06:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
body so that's it's the county
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
delegation they are the legislative body
 
06:17:15.390 --> 06:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
but it's it's better language to to
 
06:17:18.590 --> 06:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
specify the words County
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
delegation so that's that's that the
 
06:17:23.910 --> 06:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
other thing that I thought that was
 
06:17:26.430 --> 06:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
important with regards to feedback that
 
06:17:28.590 --> 06:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
we heard during the hearing was the
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
whole notion of just a revolving fund so
 
06:17:33.680 --> 06:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
whole notion of just a revolving fund so
I

06:17:35.830 --> 06:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:17:40.708 --> 06:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
suggested that the the section be more
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
narrowly titled and defined within the
 
06:17:47.708 --> 06:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
language of this new section to
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
specifically specify a County public
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
safety revolving fund I thought that
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
that went a long way to to help um with
 
06:18:01.230 --> 06:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
regards to this new
 
06:18:05.708 --> 06:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
section so additionally there
 
06:18:10.708 --> 06:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
was some concerns with if you would see
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
the side by-side comparison doesn't have
 
06:18:17.070 --> 06:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
line numbers but nevertheless in section
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
two if you look at col the leftmost
 
06:18:24.430 --> 06:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
column to the middle column which is 57h
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment we're looking at notice
 
06:18:30.750 --> 06:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
the highlighted Words May became
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
shall that was important because shall
 
06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
means you're going to do it it's not an
 
06:18:41.590 --> 06:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
option so it says that if now to be
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
clear this is a this is an an
 
06:18:46.948 --> 06:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
enabling statute if it becomes law so
 
06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's optional it's um counties don't
 
06:18:54.390 --> 06:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
have to do this but if a county
 
06:18:56.468 --> 06:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
establishes a County public safety
 
06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
revolving fund for the purposes
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
identified in paragraph Roman numeral
 
06:19:06.750 --> 06:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
one it shall deposit into the
 
06:19:11.230 --> 06:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
fund and as I said it's it's not an OP
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
it's not an option May deposit into the
 
06:19:16.708 --> 06:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
fund so I thought that was important and
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
then if you um go down in the middle
 
06:19:23.430 --> 06:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
column you you see further clarifying
 
06:19:26.230 --> 06:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
language that's highlighted and the
 
06:19:30.510 --> 06:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
Clause is put in or propositional phrase
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
to replenish the fund to the original
 
06:19:35.910 --> 06:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
appropri created
 
06:19:38.350 --> 06:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
amount so
 
06:19:42.510 --> 06:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
that puts like a cap on the revolving
 
06:19:47.590 --> 06:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
fund so the original amount that was
 
06:19:51.628 --> 06:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
voted for the for the fund that's that's
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
how much money can can be in the the
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
fund and then further language says the
 
06:19:59.548 --> 06:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
county shall deposit any other revenues
 
06:20:02.110 --> 06:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
approved by the county delegation into
 
06:20:04.750 --> 06:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
the revolving fund provided that funds
 
06:20:07.990 --> 06:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
in excess of the original appropriated
 
06:20:09.990 --> 06:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
amount shall be deposited into the
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
general fund so what that's saying is
 
06:20:12.718 --> 06:20:15.190 align:start position:0%
general fund so what that's saying is
that

06:20:15.190 --> 06:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:20.910 --> 06:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
if so you have money coming into to the
 
06:20:25.510 --> 06:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
purpose to this specific County public
 
06:20:27.230 --> 06:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
safety revolving
 
06:20:30.430 --> 06:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
fund and what it's saying is that the
 
06:20:33.548 --> 06:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
funds shall be deposited into this
 
06:20:36.788 --> 06:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
revolving fund and excess shall be
 
06:20:39.510 --> 06:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
deposited into the general fund and
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
that's putting I guess guard rails if
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
you will so that the excess money goes
 
06:20:48.548 --> 06:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
into the general fund and it's not put
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
into some other line item hope that
 
06:20:51.958 --> 06:20:52.788 align:start position:0%
into some other line item hope that
makes

06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
makes
 
06:20:56.628 --> 06:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
sense and then you will also notice that
 
06:20:59.430 --> 06:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's the requirement that the County
 
06:21:01.548 --> 06:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
Treasurer will have custody of all
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
monies in the fund and shall pay out the
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
same only upon order of the County
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so a a concern that was
 
06:21:14.030 --> 06:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
voiced during the hearing is that with
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment that the prime sponsor
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
presented and spoke to there was no
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
agent um specified and that's why you
 
06:21:24.718 --> 06:21:26.270 align:start position:0%
agent um specified and that's why you
see

06:21:26.270 --> 06:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
that and that covers it that covers the
 
06:21:35.070 --> 06:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
comparison of the amendment that we have
 
06:21:38.990 --> 06:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
before us to the the the original bill
 
06:21:43.628 --> 06:21:43.638 align:start position:0%
as written so is there any discussion
 
06:21:46.230 --> 06:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
06:21:53.190 --> 06:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.628 --> 06:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
um the language I I've lost it for the
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
moment okay uh Roman numeral 4 the
 
06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
provisions of the section shall not
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
preclude the establishment of a County
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
public safety revolving fund for any
 
06:22:10.320 --> 06:22:11.190 align:start position:0%
public safety revolving fund for any
other

06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
purpose um I'm not sure that I
 
06:22:17.230 --> 06:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
understand the meaning of that uh
 
06:22:19.788 --> 06:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
because the bill or the amendment
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
establishes the County public safety
 
06:22:25.548 --> 06:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
fund and where would another one for a
 
06:22:32.708 --> 06:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.670 --> 06:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:41.190 --> 06:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
06:22:44.590 --> 06:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
language that section section four if
 
06:22:47.628 --> 06:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
you look at the bill as written and as
 
06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
referred to the committee that whole
 
06:22:52.830 --> 06:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
room and numeral section of four is is
 
06:22:54.788 --> 06:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
in in the
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill and the only thing that's different
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
with regards to the amendment that's
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
before us is the um
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:14.990 --> 06:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
safety modifying revolving
 
06:23:19.468 --> 06:23:19.478 align:start position:0%
fund so that's the best answer I can
 
06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
give to that speaking to the amendment
 
06:23:27.750 --> 06:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
at this time representative Gilman thank
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I'm a little confused
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
by some of the language um uh line 14
 
06:23:35.798 --> 06:23:37.548 align:start position:0%
by some of the language um uh line 14
through

06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:23:40.750 --> 06:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
17 um I understand that the county can
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
deposit the revenues approved for that
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that revolving
 
06:23:49.110 --> 06:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
fund but then the providing funds in
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
excess for that purpose then go to the
 
06:23:55.628 --> 06:23:55.638 align:start position:0%
general fund that that's one question
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
how can you do that if you're if you're
 
06:24:01.230 --> 06:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
putting money in for a specific purpose
 
06:24:03.670 --> 06:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then next the following line the
 
06:24:05.830 --> 06:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
money in the fund shall all be allowed
 
06:24:08.750 --> 06:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
to accumulate from year to year so if
 
06:24:11.230 --> 06:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
there's extra funds why are they being
 
06:24:14.350 --> 06:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to accumulate or be returned to
 
06:24:17.548 --> 06:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
the general fund okay so um with regards
 
06:24:20.468 --> 06:24:20.478 align:start position:0%
to your first comment
 
06:24:23.548 --> 06:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
um as was explained to me by by the
 
06:24:27.548 --> 06:24:27.558 align:start position:0%
prime prime sponsor that
 
06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
the the payment for services rendered
 
06:24:32.990 --> 06:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of providing Public
 
06:24:33.000 --> 06:24:36.030 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of providing Public
Safety

06:24:36.030 --> 06:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.040 --> 06:24:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
those

06:24:37.070 --> 06:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
payments are to go into this revolving
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
fund and
 
06:24:48.628 --> 06:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
that any extra that's above and and
 
06:24:52.190 --> 06:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
Beyond what was specified by the county
 
06:24:54.548 --> 06:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
delegation when the fund
 
06:24:57.750 --> 06:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
was adopted or
 
06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
accepted W would go to the general fund
 
06:25:02.628 --> 06:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
so the point being is that there's
 
06:25:05.788 --> 06:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
there's two places
 
06:25:10.590 --> 06:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
first the the the monies for services
 
06:25:14.948 --> 06:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
rendered shall go into this revolving
 
06:25:17.948 --> 06:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
fund and extra will go
 
06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
into the general fund to answer the
 
06:25:25.628 --> 06:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
second part of your your
 
06:25:29.948 --> 06:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:33.868 --> 06:25:33.878 align:start position:0%
to money accumulating yes money can
 
06:25:37.110 --> 06:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
accum accumulate in the revolving
 
06:25:40.868 --> 06:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
fund it's not considered excess
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
until the money that has accumulated
 
06:25:49.070 --> 06:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
exceeds the amount that was established
 
06:25:51.310 --> 06:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
by the county are specified by the
 
06:25:53.830 --> 06:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
county delegation at the time that the
 
06:26:01.270 --> 06:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:03.868 --> 06:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
established I I'm still not clear on how
 
06:26:07.390 --> 06:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
you can do this with a revolving fund uh
 
06:26:09.788 --> 06:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
it it's like saying you're saying the
 
06:26:12.270 --> 06:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
opposite thing that any excess funds
 
06:26:17.110 --> 06:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund which is um not
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a revolving fund
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
especially if it's allowed to accumulate
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
from year to year which is the opposite
 
06:26:26.430 --> 06:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
of putting the extra funds into the
 
06:26:26.440 --> 06:26:28.270 align:start position:0%
of putting the extra funds into the
general

06:26:28.270 --> 06:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
general
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
fund and we're talking I think we're
 
06:26:33.948 --> 06:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
using the same words but not necessarily
 
06:26:37.708 --> 06:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
in the same order
 
06:26:41.468 --> 06:26:41.478 align:start position:0%
so may I offer that both
 
06:26:44.990 --> 06:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative stavis and I spent a
 
06:26:48.750 --> 06:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
considerable considerable amount of time
 
06:26:51.190 --> 06:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday speaking with the with the
 
06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to to to to to work on
 
06:26:55.910 --> 06:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
this language and to to get it right
 
06:26:58.590 --> 06:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
Additionally the prime sponsor met with
 
06:27:01.030 --> 06:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and they provided
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
input so that's that's my best
 
06:27:08.270 --> 06:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of it I am not a um
 
06:27:08.280 --> 06:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
understanding of it I am not a um
Financial

06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
06:27:13.548 --> 06:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
expert and I did Grill the prime sponsor
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
to seek understanding so that I could
 
06:27:19.548 --> 06:27:19.558 align:start position:0%
explain it here to the committee which
 
06:27:23.270 --> 06:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe and I checked my
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
understanding with him and and so that's
 
06:27:27.830 --> 06:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
the that's the best that I can do to
 
06:27:31.030 --> 06:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
explain and I I do have confidence in in
 
06:27:34.708 --> 06:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
in um the way this is set up perhaps
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
the chair can Rec will recognize
 
06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
representative stavis for um further
 
06:27:42.670 --> 06:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you madam chair
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I'd like to
 
06:27:46.708 --> 06:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
make a
 
06:27:50.788 --> 06:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to move itl on this bill
 
06:27:54.150 --> 06:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:57.628 --> 06:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
motion okay so I I believe that we need
 
06:28:02.190 --> 06:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:20.750 --> 06:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
so we do have an emotion
 
06:28:29.510 --> 06:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
an a motion to accept this this
 
06:28:31.110 --> 06:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that's what's before us so we
 
06:28:32.750 --> 06:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to dispose of
 
06:28:35.230 --> 06:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
that is there any other further
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
06:28:36.558 --> 06:28:38.468 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
representative

06:28:38.468 --> 06:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair um looking
 
06:28:43.310 --> 06:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
through the amendment some of my
 
06:28:45.310 --> 06:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
concerns is kind of the same things
 
06:28:47.070 --> 06:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
other people spoke of talks about
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
depositing any other revenues which
 
06:28:50.150 --> 06:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sure what any other
 
06:28:52.430 --> 06:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
revenues would be if you're billing out
 
06:28:55.270 --> 06:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
for for example construction traffic
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
that should be the only Revenue so I'm
 
06:28:57.868 --> 06:28:57.878 align:start position:0%
not sure what else because I think that
 
06:29:00.750 --> 06:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
would have a effect on the county budget
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
by the time we're done because we then
 
06:29:03.628 --> 06:29:03.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be putting the revenues back to
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
where they long it almost feels like
 
06:29:07.708 --> 06:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix a problem that if
 
06:29:08.990 --> 06:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the delegation and the County
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are setting their budget
 
06:29:13.590 --> 06:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
properly that they are able to have a
 
06:29:15.468 --> 06:29:15.478 align:start position:0%
enough expenses and enough Revenue in
 
06:29:16.830 --> 06:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
there so it actually doesn't have any
 
06:29:19.468 --> 06:29:19.478 align:start position:0%
effect on the tax purposes but I also
 
06:29:21.390 --> 06:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
had the same concern is representative
 
06:29:22.990 --> 06:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
Gilman about the line that says the
 
06:29:24.548 --> 06:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
money and the fund shall be allowed to
 
06:29:26.310 --> 06:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
accumulate I would understand if it said
 
06:29:29.548 --> 06:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
roll over but accumulate and again
 
06:29:30.830 --> 06:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
because it would be going from one year
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the next year Rolling the the balance
 
06:29:35.350 --> 06:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
over cuz the first year you're going to
 
06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
have to put uh seed money into this to
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
which is going to affect the the tax
 
06:29:43.190 --> 06:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
rate as well so uh that's just some of
 
06:29:43.200 --> 06:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
rate as well so uh that's just some of
my

06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:29:48.670 --> 06:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
concerns my I would just like to briefly
 
06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
respond to that so yes that is correct
 
06:29:53.590 --> 06:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
that seed money will need to come from a
 
06:29:57.030 --> 06:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
line item but um to be clear my
 
06:29:59.468 --> 06:29:59.478 align:start position:0%
understanding with regards to a
 
06:30:03.548 --> 06:30:03.558 align:start position:0%
revolving fund as a as a budgetary tool
 
06:30:07.670 --> 06:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
is is is reasonable and the the the
 
06:30:10.190 --> 06:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
reason this bill was was brought forward
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
is because the way that things are being
 
06:30:19.708 --> 06:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:23.628 --> 06:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's it's tying
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
hands um maybe that's not the the right
 
06:30:31.590 --> 06:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
word but it the a revolving fund is is a
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
tool a
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
to to be able to provide these types of
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
services to be able to accept payment
 
06:30:42.948 --> 06:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
for services rendered and then to be
 
06:30:48.628 --> 06:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
able to pay the um law and the county
 
06:30:51.990 --> 06:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agents to be able to
 
06:30:53.270 --> 06:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide those
 
06:30:53.280 --> 06:30:55.350 align:start position:0%
provide those
services

06:30:55.350 --> 06:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:30:58.110 --> 06:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
so the last thing that I'll say is that
 
06:30:59.150 --> 06:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's things are set up now and the way
 
06:31:04.830 --> 06:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
that things work now is that with a
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
particular line item that you have to
 
06:31:09.948 --> 06:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
kind you have to guess and so there's
 
06:31:13.110 --> 06:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
the concern that the county might over
 
06:31:15.548 --> 06:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
budget and therefore over tax that the
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
County residents so I I to me this is
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a reasonable and
 
06:31:25.910 --> 06:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
proper financial tool a revolving fund
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
but all right so I saw someone else that
 
06:31:31.150 --> 06:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
had a comment representative
 
06:31:35.468 --> 06:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
kazinski yes um in town we use this and
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
the idea behind it is that you can't
 
06:31:40.990 --> 06:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
budget for something that's coming up
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you don't know and these Public
 
06:31:47.948 --> 06:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
Safety details are going to happen and
 
06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to fund it somehow
 
06:31:52.510 --> 06:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
06:31:56.270 --> 06:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
put monies in an account just the seed
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
money you're going to do that every year
 
06:32:00.350 --> 06:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
anyway even without a revolving fund but
 
06:32:04.030 --> 06:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
as the money comes back in you're paying
 
06:32:06.910 --> 06:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
your personnel and expenses out of that
 
06:32:10.230 --> 06:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
fund hopefully you are charging more
 
06:32:14.788 --> 06:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
than the cost so the excess money should
 
06:32:17.230 --> 06:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
go back to the general fund and the
 
06:32:20.070 --> 06:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and then I think that seed
 
06:32:22.708 --> 06:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
money will eventually come out but at
 
06:32:24.750 --> 06:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
least the next year it won't have to go
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
in to the point that you're starting the
 
06:32:30.430 --> 06:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle with the revolving
 
06:32:32.830 --> 06:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
fund having enough money to initially
 
06:32:34.590 --> 06:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
start paying
 
06:32:38.350 --> 06:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
the Personnel if I got that right so
 
06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further comments the
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you madam chair I I have no
 
06:32:50.990 --> 06:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue with the basic um intent and
 
06:32:53.990 --> 06:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose here we go um of of
 
06:32:57.030 --> 06:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I think
 
06:33:00.070 --> 06:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that when all is said and done it's
 
06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
probably a very good
 
06:33:06.388 --> 06:33:06.398 align:start position:0%
idea as my colleague just said uh my
 
06:33:08.910 --> 06:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
problem and it's kind of been a problem
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
all along is we I don't feel that we on
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
this committee have the accounting
 
06:33:20.548 --> 06:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
expertise to write this the right
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
way um and and my concern is that we're
 
06:33:26.388 --> 06:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
going to miss a word here or miss a word
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
there and in that one or two
 
06:33:33.070 --> 06:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
words a a world of Mischief could be
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
done so I I don't trust myself to be
 
06:33:40.788 --> 06:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
sure um I can't speak for others but I
 
06:33:42.948 --> 06:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
certainly don't trust myself to write
 
06:33:45.548 --> 06:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
this in a way that it's kind of Ironclad
 
06:33:49.110 --> 06:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
that nothing could go wrong here
 
06:33:53.948 --> 06:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
and I I would like to be sure in my own
 
06:33:56.670 --> 06:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
mind that that we have constructed
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
06:34:02.310 --> 06:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
foolproof and that accounting experts
 
06:34:04.830 --> 06:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
agree you know yes this is the accepted
 
06:34:07.110 --> 06:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
practice this this is what's going to
 
06:34:09.388 --> 06:34:09.398 align:start position:0%
work these are the things that it will
 
06:34:11.708 --> 06:34:11.718 align:start position:0%
prevent from going wrong and if I if I
 
06:34:13.788 --> 06:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
was confident in that I'd be more
 
06:34:16.750 --> 06:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
confident in it overall but I do not
 
06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with the premise of the
 
06:34:23.110 --> 06:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill further question I meant
 
06:34:26.670 --> 06:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
comments representative grund thank you
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh representative Davis
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
for the comments around that I think
 
06:34:33.708 --> 06:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
there is a a lot of detail that could
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
would be very minute but one of the
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
things that doesn't necessarily address
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
for me is also it does say the uh payout
 
06:34:43.150 --> 06:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
the same upon order of the County
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I just want to make sure
 
06:34:47.708 --> 06:34:47.718 align:start position:0%
that there's an approval process that
 
06:34:49.430 --> 06:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
the county commissioner has to go
 
06:34:51.070 --> 06:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
through in order to move the money
 
06:34:53.510 --> 06:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
around is there whether it's approval by
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
the delegation or the board um that the
 
06:34:59.708 --> 06:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
executive board that works with them um
 
06:35:01.030 --> 06:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there's an
 
06:35:04.628 --> 06:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
authorization to move money around
 
06:35:06.990 --> 06:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
so the the answer to that would would
 
06:35:10.628 --> 06:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
would be yes so just to reiterate the
 
06:35:12.510 --> 06:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the legislative body which is the
 
06:35:12.520 --> 06:35:13.468 align:start position:0%
the the legislative body which is the
county

06:35:13.468 --> 06:35:13.478 align:start position:0%
county
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
delegation would vote to to to authorize
 
06:35:20.590 --> 06:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
to provide this this revolving fund and
 
06:35:23.590 --> 06:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
so the specification of the the
 
06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is the checks and balances
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
so the the Commissioners would would
 
06:35:30.910 --> 06:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:35:35.110 --> 06:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
approve um those that that those
 
06:35:35.120 --> 06:35:41.750 align:start position:0%
approve um those that that those
actions

06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative majori thank you
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman I'm just curious if uh
 
06:35:51.230 --> 06:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's a two-park question just curious if
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
one of the stakeholders that was
 
06:35:54.430 --> 06:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
consulted was the association of
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
position it is my understanding that
 
06:36:05.548 --> 06:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
is this the new
 
06:36:07.868 --> 06:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
hampsh New Hampshire when Kate Horan's
 
06:36:10.388 --> 06:36:10.398 align:start position:0%
here it's my understanding that that
 
06:36:14.670 --> 06:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
they that that they were at the table um
 
06:36:17.190 --> 06:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
with a number of other stakeholders okay
 
06:36:17.200 --> 06:36:19.468 align:start position:0%
with a number of other stakeholders okay
thank

06:41:02.270 --> 06:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
110 so last I would like to open the
 
06:41:06.430 --> 06:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 78
 
06:41:08.948 --> 06:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
requiring a person to have a domicile in
 
06:41:11.310 --> 06:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
the district from which they serve as
 
06:41:11.320 --> 06:41:16.948 align:start position:0%
the district from which they serve as
County

06:41:16.948 --> 06:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:19.948 --> 06:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioner okay at this time uh I
 
06:41:23.150 --> 06:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
would like to offer an amendment for
 
06:41:25.910 --> 06:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
accept acceptance by the committee and
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is amendment
 
06:41:37.590 --> 06:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:40.830 --> 06:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
so um the reason we have this amendment
 
06:41:44.590 --> 06:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
in in front of us is as you recall um
 
06:41:48.310 --> 06:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
the good Senator um from
 
06:41:51.708 --> 06:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
Rochester he came to the committee and
 
06:41:55.910 --> 06:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
had an amendment and the house cannot
 
06:42:00.190 --> 06:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
um amend a senate Amendment so
 
06:42:03.868 --> 06:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
therefore the we had to
 
06:42:06.628 --> 06:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
have OSS draft a house Amendment so
 
06:42:09.670 --> 06:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's before us so what the
 
06:42:13.468 --> 06:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
purpose of the amendment is is that it
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
um it further
 
06:42:16.558 --> 06:42:19.230 align:start position:0%
um it further
clarifies

06:42:19.230 --> 06:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
06:42:23.548 --> 06:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
language requ establishing residency
 
06:42:26.750 --> 06:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so as you can see in lines
 
06:42:29.388 --> 06:42:29.398 align:start position:0%
the bold print in the amendment six and
 
06:42:29.398 --> 06:42:34.070 align:start position:0%
the bold print in the amendment six and
seven

06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:36.310 --> 06:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
there there was some you concerns that
 
06:42:40.150 --> 06:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
we heard at at the hearing um so
 
06:42:43.150 --> 06:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
nevertheless so you can read it it says
 
06:42:46.388 --> 06:42:46.398 align:start position:0%
that it requires that the the
 
06:42:49.910 --> 06:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
person shall be at the time of his or
 
06:42:53.190 --> 06:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
her election an inhabitant who resides
 
06:42:56.270 --> 06:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
actually and permanently in the county
 
06:42:58.750 --> 06:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
from which he or she is chosen and that
 
06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
same language uh
 
06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
appears on lines 10 through 13 and also
 
06:43:08.708 --> 06:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
further specifies
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
that um upon the time in which the
 
06:43:15.388 --> 06:43:15.398 align:start position:0%
person uh ceases to be
 
06:43:19.830 --> 06:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
qualified that they will no longer um
 
06:43:22.788 --> 06:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
represent the district that they were
 
06:43:24.670 --> 06:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
elected to
 
06:43:30.110 --> 06:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
represent so um this language here was
 
06:43:31.590 --> 06:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
inspired by the New Hampshire
 
06:43:31.600 --> 06:43:33.270 align:start position:0%
inspired by the New Hampshire
Constitution

06:43:33.270 --> 06:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:43:34.750 --> 06:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I came up with the word
 
06:43:39.270 --> 06:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
inhabitant and additionally I further
 
06:43:41.628 --> 06:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
strengthened that
 
06:43:44.548 --> 06:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
requirement with the legal definition of
 
06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
inhabitant which um specifies or defines
 
06:43:52.270 --> 06:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
it as a person who resides actually and
 
06:43:54.868 --> 06:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
permanently in a
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
place do I have a second did I ask for a
 
06:44:00.230 --> 06:44:00.240 align:start position:0%

06:44:06.000 --> 06:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
Walker I apologize I should ask for a
second

06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%

06:44:12.110 --> 06:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
um comments discussion on this
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:21.548 --> 06:44:21.558 align:start position:0%
Colby oh just curious um let's see line
 
06:44:26.350 --> 06:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
four five well I guess five six
 
06:44:29.510 --> 06:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
seven um it says shall be at the time of
 
06:44:31.350 --> 06:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
his or her election does this give the
 
06:44:34.948 --> 06:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
person an opportunity to to
 
06:44:44.310 --> 06:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:50.110 --> 06:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.030 --> 06:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh to uh declare
 
06:44:57.270 --> 06:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
candidacy um with the intention of
 
06:44:59.670 --> 06:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
moving to said
 
06:45:03.708 --> 06:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
County upon winning his or her
 
06:45:06.468 --> 06:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
election or is that already going to be
 
06:45:11.948 --> 06:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
covered um sufficiently in Secretary of
 
06:45:14.388 --> 06:45:14.398 align:start position:0%
State paperwork
 
06:45:14.398 --> 06:45:20.270 align:start position:0%
State paperwork
land

06:45:20.270 --> 06:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:23.070 --> 06:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
I well the the the intent of the
 
06:45:24.830 --> 06:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
language is that the per it's
 
06:45:24.840 --> 06:45:27.510 align:start position:0%
language is that the per it's
establishing

06:45:27.510 --> 06:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
domicile so I guess your question has to
 
06:45:33.070 --> 06:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
do with
 
06:45:36.350 --> 06:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
I suppose it it just talking it out I
 
06:45:37.990 --> 06:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
think it could be covered likely
 
06:45:41.590 --> 06:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in Secretary of State um you
 
06:45:43.830 --> 06:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
know running for
 
06:45:45.948 --> 06:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
office well
 
06:45:49.430 --> 06:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
I I believe that's most
 
06:45:53.670 --> 06:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:57.310 --> 06:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
answer um representative Murphy thank
 
06:45:59.948 --> 06:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair my the question the
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
problem I have is when you file and
 
06:46:06.708 --> 06:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
for a county or other position State Rep
 
06:46:09.070 --> 06:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
or what have you you have to do that I
 
06:46:10.468 --> 06:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
believe in
 
06:46:13.708 --> 06:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
June or thereabouts so that person would
 
06:46:16.750 --> 06:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to already established residency at
 
06:46:19.350 --> 06:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
that point not at the time of the
 
06:46:20.750 --> 06:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
election in
 
06:46:20.760 --> 06:46:24.070 align:start position:0%
election in
November

06:46:24.070 --> 06:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:27.628 --> 06:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
that's so my my my response to that
 
06:46:30.230 --> 06:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be in order for the person to file
 
06:46:33.750 --> 06:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that is true so in order to file
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:40.548 --> 06:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
residency well they can't if they if
 
06:46:43.430 --> 06:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
they if they are ineligible to file then
 
06:46:49.868 --> 06:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:52.670 --> 06:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
this yeah I I it could be I don't know I
 
06:46:55.070 --> 06:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
just I'm concerned that this might cause
 
06:46:57.590 --> 06:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
confusion shall be at the time of his or
 
06:47:00.670 --> 06:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
her election and inhabitant who
 
06:47:03.388 --> 06:47:03.398 align:start position:0%
resides yeah just to clarify
 
06:47:07.150 --> 06:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
in order for a person to be eligible to
 
06:47:09.590 --> 06:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
file they have to have
 
06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
established a domicile so the the filing
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
is is is
 
06:47:20.750 --> 06:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
already has passed it's already a
 
06:47:23.708 --> 06:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
thing representative majority thank you
 
06:47:27.430 --> 06:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman um but isn't that the
 
06:47:30.548 --> 06:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
ambiguity that we are trying to fix
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
because in straford County right now
 
06:47:37.270 --> 06:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
you have people filing and running in
 
06:47:37.280 --> 06:47:38.468 align:start position:0%
you have people filing and running in
different

06:47:38.468 --> 06:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:47:42.110 --> 06:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
districts so that's the problem they are
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
they they still would be able to file in
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
a different
 
06:47:50.670 --> 06:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:53.350 --> 06:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe I'm looking to Mr Walker or
 
06:47:55.270 --> 06:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative Walker excuse me who may
 
06:47:57.270 --> 06:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
may seem to help
 
06:47:59.628 --> 06:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
me representative Walker do you have a
 
06:47:59.638 --> 06:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
me representative Walker do you have a
comment

06:48:03.190 --> 06:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:04.590 --> 06:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
it could be a little bit confusing
 
06:48:07.110 --> 06:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
because it says the election not the
 
06:48:10.270 --> 06:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:12.388 --> 06:48:12.398 align:start position:0%
office someone might take that as a
 
06:48:15.468 --> 06:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
loophole that I live in Ward
 
06:48:20.708 --> 06:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
five I'll file for the ward four slot
 
06:48:23.270 --> 06:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then by the election I have to move
 
06:48:25.468 --> 06:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
there so you got the same problem you
 
06:48:25.478 --> 06:48:29.388 align:start position:0%
there so you got the same problem you
got

06:48:29.388 --> 06:48:29.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:32.270 --> 06:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
now representative Gilman thank you
 
06:48:33.430 --> 06:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
06:48:35.990 --> 06:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think I thought at the time the
 
06:48:38.230 --> 06:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
original original bill that we were
 
06:48:39.868 --> 06:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
trying to solve a problem that happened
 
06:48:41.990 --> 06:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the redistricting of the or the
 
06:48:45.150 --> 06:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
districting I should say of stord
 
06:48:48.070 --> 06:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
County sorry
 
06:48:51.590 --> 06:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
um but this uh so districting stord
 
06:48:54.830 --> 06:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
County which had not had been electing
 
06:48:59.110 --> 06:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at large so when the when
 
06:49:02.230 --> 06:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
we pass the bill to district straford
 
06:49:02.240 --> 06:49:03.230 align:start position:0%
we pass the bill to district straford
county

06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
county
 
06:49:08.590 --> 06:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
someone was running in a district in an
 
06:49:12.270 --> 06:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
area at large that now had a had a
 
06:49:14.990 --> 06:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
district commissioner so they were not
 
06:49:16.708 --> 06:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
living in the district that they came
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
from because there hadn't been district
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
lines so this amendment
 
06:49:24.708 --> 06:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't is I I
 
06:49:27.510 --> 06:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
agree I agree with it been said before
 
06:49:30.070 --> 06:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
that um it has to be at the time that
 
06:49:33.430 --> 06:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
they uh register for candidates
 
06:49:37.628 --> 06:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
see because of that um changing of
 
06:49:41.548 --> 06:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
lines thank you okay so um what I will
 
06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
direct members to do right now is to
 
06:49:49.670 --> 06:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
um recognize that we have this amendment
 
06:49:54.548 --> 06:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
before us we also had the the Senate
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment which essentially is doing the
 
06:49:57.600 --> 06:49:58.548 align:start position:0%
Amendment which essentially is doing the
same

06:49:58.548 --> 06:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:50:03.190 --> 06:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
thing and furthermore um the amend ments
 
06:50:06.110 --> 06:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
aside we have we we can look at the
 
06:50:11.270 --> 06:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
original language of the bill okay
 
06:50:14.670 --> 06:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the original language
 
06:50:18.310 --> 06:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:50:24.270 --> 06:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:27.708 --> 06:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
statute as written that I mean nothing's
 
06:50:29.468 --> 06:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
really changing because if you go back
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
and you look at the the original bill
 
06:50:37.430 --> 06:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
the only bold that we see is on line six
 
06:50:42.270 --> 06:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
and straford correct so just to be clear
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
this whole discussion about a person
 
06:50:46.030 --> 06:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
must have a doile in the county for
 
06:50:48.350 --> 06:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
which he is chosen that's current
 
06:50:48.360 --> 06:50:50.628 align:start position:0%
which he is chosen that's current
statute

06:50:50.628 --> 06:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:50:50.638 --> 06:50:53.190 align:start position:0%
statute
correct

06:50:53.190 --> 06:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:50:56.110 --> 06:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
so the reason why we that that I'm
 
06:50:57.990 --> 06:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
offering this amendment because I was
 
06:51:01.310 --> 06:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
going off of the amendment that was
 
06:51:03.110 --> 06:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
brought here
 
06:51:09.830 --> 06:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:12.830 --> 06:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
senator is this making
 
06:51:18.350 --> 06:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:22.510 --> 06:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
Elward maybe to add to the confusion but
 
06:51:25.468 --> 06:51:25.478 align:start position:0%
just because you file for candidacy
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're going to win so why
 
06:51:30.388 --> 06:51:30.398 align:start position:0%
would you move
 
06:51:33.190 --> 06:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
yourself in anticipation
 
06:51:34.388 --> 06:51:34.398 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:41.670 --> 06:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
win further
 
06:51:44.910 --> 06:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative kazinski what I
 
06:51:47.830 --> 06:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
found on the internet is to be a county
 
06:51:50.030 --> 06:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner in New Hampshire you have
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
to be a citizen of the United States be
 
06:51:54.350 --> 06:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
at least 21 years old be eligible to
 
06:51:56.830 --> 06:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
vote and have been a resident of the
 
06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
district for at least 30
 
06:52:04.590 --> 06:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:05.910 --> 06:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
I think you're right as far as the
 
06:52:09.868 --> 06:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and what
 
06:52:15.388 --> 06:52:15.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:19.910 --> 06:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:22.868 --> 06:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
comments representative Davis thank you
 
06:52:25.270 --> 06:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair is there any reason why we
 
06:52:27.548 --> 06:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
can't take the Senate
 
06:52:29.868 --> 06:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment and just make it a house
 
06:52:33.388 --> 06:52:33.398 align:start position:0%
Amendment and move that
 
06:52:35.510 --> 06:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
we we we cannot do that because it's a
 
06:52:37.868 --> 06:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
senate Amendment that's how it came out
 
06:52:40.750 --> 06:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
of OSS we we can't do
 
06:52:44.670 --> 06:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
that no unfortunately so just to be
 
06:52:44.680 --> 06:52:49.788 align:start position:0%
that no unfortunately so just to be
clear

06:52:49.788 --> 06:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:52.468 --> 06:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
anyway the amendment that's before you
 
06:52:55.030 --> 06:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
does the in my mind the same thing as
 
06:52:56.830 --> 06:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
06:53:00.708 --> 06:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment with improved terms like L
 
06:53:00.718 --> 06:53:02.948 align:start position:0%
Amendment with improved terms like L
like

06:53:02.948 --> 06:53:02.958 align:start position:0%

06:53:04.948 --> 06:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
I liked inhabitant
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:17.708 --> 06:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
domicile further questions um no
 
06:53:23.670 --> 06:53:23.680 align:start position:0%

representative

06:53:25.150 --> 06:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:42.510 --> 06:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
nothing but I to be honest I I I like to
 
06:53:45.670 --> 06:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
um put my own touch on
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
things representative
 
06:53:50.670 --> 06:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I don't
 
06:53:54.830 --> 06:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
like plagiarism just for the record um
 
06:53:57.070 --> 06:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
can I copy you on
 
06:54:00.990 --> 06:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
that um how would you feel how would you
 
06:54:04.190 --> 06:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
all feel about just getting rid of the
 
06:54:18.990 --> 06:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:22.868 --> 06:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
election what what line is this that I'm
 
06:54:26.270 --> 06:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
sorry it is in the amendment it's lines
 
06:54:33.510 --> 06:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
so to to be clear um if we go back and
 
06:54:40.350 --> 06:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
we look at the bill as filed that that
 
06:54:44.388 --> 06:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
language is is there at the time of his
 
06:54:48.750 --> 06:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
election and that's what is currently in
 
06:54:51.270 --> 06:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
statute so if we go back and we look at
 
06:54:55.628 --> 06:54:55.638 align:start position:0%
the bill as filed the only changes was
 
06:54:59.190 --> 06:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
the and was struck to add in the county
 
06:54:59.200 --> 06:54:59.910 align:start position:0%
the and was struck to add in the county
of

06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:55:02.310 --> 06:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
straford so we're we're we're kind of
 
06:55:04.830 --> 06:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
splitting hairs or laser focusing on
 
06:55:04.840 --> 06:55:07.230 align:start position:0%
splitting hairs or laser focusing on
something

06:55:07.230 --> 06:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:55:11.030 --> 06:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute and that's not
 
06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
what we're that's not really what the
 
06:55:22.948 --> 06:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.430 --> 06:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:30.548 --> 06:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
see that'll be home the bill where's the
 
06:55:44.510 --> 06:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:50.270 --> 06:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
Madam yes oh representative frock thank
 
06:55:55.270 --> 06:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair if the original bill as
 
06:55:59.708 --> 06:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
introduced is and is current law and the
 
06:56:02.788 --> 06:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
only change is eliminate
 
06:56:09.548 --> 06:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:13.548 --> 06:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
straford why is there a need for an
 
06:56:17.230 --> 06:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that just seems to be muddying
 
06:56:17.240 --> 06:56:18.548 align:start position:0%
amendment that just seems to be muddying
the

06:56:18.548 --> 06:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:56:21.788 --> 06:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
waters thank you representative F frock
 
06:56:24.350 --> 06:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
that is a point well taken so the
 
06:56:28.590 --> 06:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
options are if people do not like the
 
06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before
 
06:56:32.868 --> 06:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
us we can
 
06:56:37.070 --> 06:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
not accept that and we can revert to the
 
06:56:41.750 --> 06:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill as filed and if this bill makes it
 
06:56:43.310 --> 06:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
over to the other
 
06:56:47.990 --> 06:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
chamber the good Senator over there can

07:03:12.430 --> 07:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
bills that have been referred to this
 
07:03:15.830 --> 07:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee to reiterate I would like to
 
07:03:18.510 --> 07:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
not have to meet during the last week in
 
07:03:22.510 --> 07:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
February to give people a
 
07:03:26.388 --> 07:03:26.398 align:start position:0%
break so in order to do this as the
 
07:03:29.510 --> 07:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
weeks go on we might need to pick up um
 
07:03:33.110 --> 07:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
an additional day between now and then
 
07:03:36.948 --> 07:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
but stay tuned on that and additionally
 
07:03:38.990 --> 07:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
07:03:42.510 --> 07:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
just remind members that if you want to
 
07:03:45.868 --> 07:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to a bill please
 
07:03:48.708 --> 07:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
inform both myself the chair as well as
 
07:03:49.868 --> 07:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
the ranking
 
07:03:53.388 --> 07:03:53.398 align:start position:0%
member so the reason is a couple of
 
07:03:57.270 --> 07:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
things um we want to understand who is
 
07:04:01.150 --> 07:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
working on amendments so that we can um
 
07:04:03.468 --> 07:04:03.478 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's the process is
 
07:04:06.230 --> 07:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
moving along additionally I would like
 
07:04:10.868 --> 07:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
to avoid the chance that multiple people
 
07:04:14.230 --> 07:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
are working on the same type of an
 
07:04:17.190 --> 07:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um to the same bill we don't
 
07:04:20.670 --> 07:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
want to waste members time or the um
 
07:04:23.468 --> 07:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
resources at OS so if we could
 
07:04:26.388 --> 07:04:26.398 align:start position:0%
coordinate that um that that would be
 
07:04:30.948 --> 07:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
great and also um the chair and ranking
 
07:04:34.468 --> 07:04:34.478 align:start position:0%
member is here to assist you with a
 
07:04:38.230 --> 07:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
language two heads are better than one
 
07:04:41.868 --> 07:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
um also with regards to amendments
 
07:04:45.430 --> 07:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
please submit any requests to OSS sooner
 
07:04:47.670 --> 07:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
than later
 
07:04:50.788 --> 07:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
because I would like for any amendments
 
07:04:53.350 --> 07:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
to be shared with this committee all
 
07:04:56.708 --> 07:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
committee members at least 48 hours
 
07:05:00.510 --> 07:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of a scheduled executive session
 
07:05:03.590 --> 07:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can read the
 
07:05:05.948 --> 07:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
amendment understand the
 
07:05:10.990 --> 07:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and um sort things out so that
 
07:05:13.548 --> 07:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
things aren't
 
07:05:17.990 --> 07:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
um as complex when we go to exec a bill
 
07:05:20.788 --> 07:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
also please be aware that if you are
 
07:05:22.628 --> 07:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
requesting an amendment through the
 
07:05:25.670 --> 07:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
portal the intake sheet asks you to
 
07:05:28.110 --> 07:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
specify a date and a time that the
 
07:05:32.190 --> 07:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is needed the chair
 
07:05:36.430 --> 07:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
made the innocent mistake of putting
 
07:05:39.910 --> 07:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
into those fields the date and time of
 
07:05:46.230 --> 07:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
the executive session so I um uh
 
07:05:49.830 --> 07:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
realized my my um misunderstanding and
 
07:05:53.628 --> 07:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
clarified it with OS and so I thought OS
 
07:05:56.750 --> 07:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
was going to back up and and say oh well
 
07:05:59.030 --> 07:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna release this so
 
07:06:01.030 --> 07:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee has enough time to to
 
07:06:02.230 --> 07:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
read it
 
07:06:04.310 --> 07:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that calculation
 
07:06:07.468 --> 07:06:07.478 align:start position:0%
so I'm just recommending that um make
 
07:06:10.270 --> 07:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
your request accordingly so that we can
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
get amendments to committee members at
 
07:06:15.190 --> 07:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
least 48
 
07:06:17.430 --> 07:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
hours I mean if it's
 
07:06:21.310 --> 07:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
24 okay but that's not that's not the
 
07:06:24.548 --> 07:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
