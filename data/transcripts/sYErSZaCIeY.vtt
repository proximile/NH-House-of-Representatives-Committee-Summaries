00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10: a.m. we're going to get
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
going um representative wood would like
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh today is going to be our first
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
true grinder of a day um so we've got a
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of hearings uh executive session
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
will start at uh 10:10 and what will
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
happen is we will come in and out of
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
executive session as time allows um
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
there's going to be time limits today
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
for speaking um as I stated when we did
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
our orientation we have 75 bills so it
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
requires us to hear 15 bills a day um so
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a statement about any policy or
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
anything it's just a statement about
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is what happens when a committee
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
has 75 bills and everyone gets a public
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so with that uh I'm going to
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing for cacr 5 uh
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
relative to absentee ballots providing
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
that no excuse shall be needed by the
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
voter to receive an absentee ballot or
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
repes recognize is representative Lane

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%

sir um I was just fumbling for my notes
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
and can't seem to find them so I guess
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be doing this from for
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
memory for the record I'm Connie Lane
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative uh from uh marac uh
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
district 16 which is war two in
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
conquered and I am bringing uh cacr 5
 
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose purpose is to uh improve
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
access uh for voters in New Hampshire so
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
that they will have the same ability to
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
choose as 37 other states allow uh no
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee ballot um there like I
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
said there's
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
37 states that allow no excuse absentee
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
voting there are eight states that do
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
full wrin voting and in that um 37 our
 
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
full wrin voting and in that um 37 our
states

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
like uh Montana Wyoming this is why I
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
need my notes North Dakota South Dakota
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh Nevada um so they're not all blue
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
states it is uh very much has been
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
endorsed by both Republicans and
 
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.070 align:start position:0%
endorsed by both Republicans and
Democrats

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
um as far as security goes uh most of
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
the um there have been a lot of studies
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
done about the security of absentee
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
ballot voting
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
and they have found one study said that
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
is as likely to get hit more likely to
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
get hit by lightning than it is to have
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
fraud in a absentee ballot
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
voter so every study has shown that the
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
fraud is infantes and all 37 states that
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
have done it have found the same to be
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
true because obviously they have the
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
same concerns about security that we
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
have and there are some safeguards that
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
they've all put in that we can adopt if
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
this constitution Amendment passes the
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
other thing that's important to remember
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
is that we need to listen to the people
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of people in New
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country support
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
this type of absentee
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
ballot and I think we should let the New
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people decide this rather than
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
have us sit here and try and guess what
 
00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
have us sit here and try and guess what
they

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
want so for that reason I would ask that
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
um you uh give New Hampshire voters the
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make the choice and uh
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
I'll let all the others behind me uh
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
will be speaking uh speak to other
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
statistics and studies and I can take
 
00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919 align:start position:0%
questions if you'd like other questions
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%

00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
David scanland Secretary of State and I
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide the committee
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
with a little information uh on this
 
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.949 align:start position:0%
with a little information uh on this
bill

00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
um our election process historically um
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
has developed over quite a long period
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
of time uh since colonial times as a
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
matter of fact and uh we kind of eased
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
into the issue of absentee voting and it
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
was created and put in our
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
constitution uh and amended several
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
times to expand it from just general
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
elections to All State elections and
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
then local elections um but it has been
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution and used in
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
elections as a matter of necessity it's
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
for individuals that are not around
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
during the election and so they have to
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
vote by an absentee B Ballot or for
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
individuals that have some type of a
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
disability that prevents them from
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
getting to the polling place and being
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
vote um the change that is being
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
proposed in the Constitutional Amendment
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
will'll change that from being a matter
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
of necessity to a matter of convenience
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
making it uh easy for people to uh
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
exercise the right to vote that simply
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to get up in the morning and
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
and go to the polling place and I think
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine you know if that's a policy
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
decision that the people of New
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will have to end up making but
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about convenience
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
in voting I think we also have to at the
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
same time talk about the security of the
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
vote and it's my belief that when the
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
the you know if a question like this was
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
going to be put on the ballot that I
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
think we have to address the other side
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
of the equation which is and I've said
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
this before to the committee but you on
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
one hand I think everybody in this room
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
would agree that it is important that
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
people that are qualified to vote have
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do that uh in a fair
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
easy way the other side of the equation
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
is that people have the right to know
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
who's participating in the elections and
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
that those people are qualified and I
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
think everybody would agree with that
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
statement the problem is those
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
two uh statements there's a tension
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
there that is pulling against each other
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
because the easier that you make it to
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
vote the more you're backing off on the
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
security end of things in the extreme if
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
he get push too far to one side you
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
create a climate where voter fraud can
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
take place on the other side of that if
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
you are if you want to make sure that
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
the vote is secure that the people are
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
qualified and they've proven it and you
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
put these restrictions on you are making
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
it less easy for that voter to exercise
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
that right to vote and in the extreme
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
that's voter suppression so the job as
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
policy makers is find that sweet spot uh
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the middle where you know people are
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
generally satisfied that it's easy and
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
that they have confidence in the outcome
 
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
of that vote and so that's why I make
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
the point that if we are going to change
 
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.230 align:start position:0%
the point that if we are going to change
the

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution for convenience let's also
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
change it to make sure that there's an
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
expectation that voters are going to be
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
willing to uh uh prove their
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
qualifications so with that oh before I
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
go I'm going to make copies of this for
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I I was at a conference
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
where Charles Stewart who's a professor
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
at MIT uh gave a fantastic presentation
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would love if he could give it to the
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee sometime but he had this chart
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh has this chart that shows uh where
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
the different states are at uh in 2024
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of their voting Practices New
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of really two states
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
that still have the traditional election
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
day voting processes um the other states
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
have have thrown in vote by mail systems
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
the early voting
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
systems and so they're you know on this
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
graph they're all over the map um and
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
then there's there's a section in the
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
Middle where it shows all of the states
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
that are kind of equally position with
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
all of those items but in doing that
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
they have actually have three distinct
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
election systems that they have to run
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
at the polling place by doing that as
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to New Hampshire which still has
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know the single simple mode of
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
voting so with that Mr chair I'd be
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions other
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
representative gasowski Gaz offski uh
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um in your opinion do you
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
think as uh we practice our voting now
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
spot I think the legislature has done a
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
good job balancing it but it is you know
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
depending on which part is in power you
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
know the the the scale Moves In One
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
Direction of the other but for the most
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
part and this is borne out with uh uh
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
some polling surveys that Andy Smith at
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
UNH has done voters in New Hampshire
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
have K high confidence uh in the
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
elections here and um and we've
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
maintained that over a sustained period
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
of time the questions committee
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
Mr secretary are you aware of any states
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
that have more uh convenient voting than
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but have uh problems with
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
that well certainly there are states
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
that have very convenient voting and I
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
look at the West Coast uh Washington and
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
Oregon for example do everything by mail
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
um I think there are concerns uh about
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
those voting systems like we have
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
concerns about voting systems in New
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they are not organized or
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
widespread you know Washington had an
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
issue in the last election where
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
somebody put an incendiary device in one
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
of their ballot dropboxes and destroyed
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
an unknown number of ballots
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
um um yeah I mean I think each state is
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit different further questions
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
to the committee representative
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
toner thank you um could you or do you
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
have knowledge of how many um
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are denied per per
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
election just a rough idea not off the
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
top of my head I I know that there are
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
um that we do keep track of absentee
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
balot that were rejected for various
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
reasons and I can certainly get that
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
number for you I just don't have it uh
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
in my head at the moment further
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
representative PM O'Brien thank you um
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to formulate my question is
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a moving Target because things
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
keep coming up that I I'm concerned
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
about Washington and
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
Oregon are their votes processed
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
publicly the way they are here I don't
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
think that they are and I've thought
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
that they uh that that it would be
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
something that would be uh of great
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
concern to New Hampshire residents
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
should we ever adopt anything similar to
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
that because of that issue I'm not
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
follow I'm not completely familiar with
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
how they actually count their votes in
 
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
those States because it's all vote by
 
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.550 align:start position:0%
those States because it's all vote by
mail

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh I would think that they use Regional
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
counting centers to expedite that
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
process um New Hampshire's process is
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
very transparent and you know all of the
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
ballots are counted in processed at the
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
polling place results being released on
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
Election night and posted there it's
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
easy to get a recount there are appeals
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
to the bot law commission and to the
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
courts um and that lends itself to
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
transparency followup uh okay so this is
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
another question more accurately I'm
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
thinking about the red states in the
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
west that were mentioned um they're very
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
spread out ranches rural there's
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
probably more of a need in in my opinion
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
for absentee voting in that kind of a
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
community what is the
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
largest distance between a voter in
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
their Town Center in New Hampshire where
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
they vote how many miles is the most
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
miles away you think that that a a a
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
voter would have to travel to vote in
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think it's not a lot
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
because it's everything's done at the
 
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.789 align:start position:0%
because it's everything's done at the
Town

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
Town
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
level every town has its own polling
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
place and so it's just a matter of where
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
that voter lives within their town to
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
their polling place should be fairly
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
close Okay further questions from Mr
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
secretary see none thank you thank you
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
um all right now we're on to General
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
comments from the public we've got 1 2 3
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
4 5 six so I'm going to impose a
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
two-minute time limit um on there uh
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
first up we'll be keeping up with our
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
tradition of letting state
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
representatives go first representative
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
Tim Horan you're up sorry Mr Rich he he
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
he fired one in he fire he fired one in
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh before I made my comment to you after
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
he made my com after I made my comment
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
to you but um but everyone going forward
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
will be on a two-minute timer um
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
representative organ welcome to election
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much I'm representing
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan from straford County uh
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
10 the which the town of Durham so I I I
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
um the right to an absentee ballot is
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
already enshrined in the Constitution
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know some people may not
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
approve of absentee voting but it's if
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
you can't go to the polls for whatever
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
reason it's makes a huge difference it's
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh better than not voting at all um so
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
we the right to vote is a fundamental
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
right and that includes the right to
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
vote absente and the this uh resolution
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
merely expands the conditions um you
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
could AR if any of you feel that maybe
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
expands it too far this is the first
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
year of the bium we can't the people
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
can't vote on this until November 2026
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
so you have till you've got a very long
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
time to think about this until late June
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
in 2026 so I would urge you uh either
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
either to pass it if you're happy with
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
it or to retain it over the summer but
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
certainly killing it now is uh killing
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
it now in 2025 is just not the right
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
thing to do so I I I urge you to protect
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
the right to vote including the right to
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
vote absentee by uh well at least
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
refraining from it Ling cacr five thanks
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions oh sure are
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thanks next up is
 
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.110 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thanks next up is
Mr

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
Richard um just a quick thing before we
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
turn Miss Richard um Miss Barnes Jean
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
Barnes I'm going to write cacr 5 on your
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
card for you so I'm going to mark your
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
card because you didn't put the bill
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
number um without objection so uh thank
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
Richard good morning ladies and
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
gentlemen I'm a little too loud here let
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
me back off thank you for hearing me
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
this morning uh I have two specific
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
reasons why I oppose this bill
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional first you are New
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire runs its state election
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
process concurrent to the federal
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
election process so what most people are
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
not going to look at is the federal
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
oversight so I oos this bill because
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
what it does by creating a no excuse
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot is now you're creating a
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
different standard practice or procedure
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
that violates the 14th Amendment and the
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
federal election laws so you want to
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind because it's not just
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
about the state law you're doing both
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
side by side so that is a binding issue
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
also State Statute 659 colon
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
50b there's a problem you have a
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
moderator who has to examine the
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to make sure that the
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
affida was properly executed if it's not
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
and you're going to create a no excuse
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
reason you're going to have to modify a
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other statutes because
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be internal conflict
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
because you're going too far now the
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
state constitution was amended in 1942
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
to permit absentee voting and prior to
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
that there was none so I would argue if
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that provided it
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is the correct this is the correct
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
resolution but it runs into too many
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
other conf conflicting Provisions like I
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
said the federal law it's got to be
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
equal if everyone who votes in person
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
has to be treated the same way why are
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
we going to create a new exception for a
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
second class of voter because that's
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what you have if you have a no
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
exemption voting right you just mail in
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
your ballot who's going to check it
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
nobody any questions perfect timing 10
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
seconds left uh questions from the
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
you um next up is uh David tremble from
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
wear good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town ofwar I support
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
this bill for a few reasons first is
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
that voting is not just a fundamental
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
right it's the right that under Pines
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
all of our rights and that was held by
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court in the case of
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
Harper versus Virginia State Board of
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
Education New Hampshire is right now the
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
most difficult state to vote in every
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
year the election Law Journal publishes
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
a report on how difficult it is to vote
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
around the country Mississippi is 49th
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is 50th we are at the
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
bottom making it the most difficult so
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
when you talk about finding The Sweet
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
Spot being between access and security
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
when you're at the bottom you're not in
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
the in in the place where you're looking
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
at The Sweet Spot the third thing is is
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
that eight states have all male voting
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
as you've pointed out 27 additional
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
states have no excuse absentee Bing
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
that's 35 States so if there was a major
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
problem by now it would have been
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
apparent but it hasn't happened around
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
the country there's been no problem with
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution it should be done
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's time for New Hampshire to catch up
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
the last thing is what about security a
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
study was done by some people at
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
Columbia Law School Steven bellan I'll
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
give you the uh when I submit my written
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
testimony explains all of the steps that
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
go through to get an absentee ballot
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's near impossible for an absentee
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
ballot to be fraudulent I'll just read
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
you the conclusion of their study he
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
writes every single study conducted on
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
voter fraud in the US shows that fraud
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
in absentee or mailin voting is
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
vanishingly small all but nonexistent at
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
the same time other Studies have
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
concluded that two strict requirements
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise a significant number and
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
that disenfranchisement
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affects historically
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged voters in other words the
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
choice here is between a very small
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement in integrity versus a
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
considerably larger harm to availability
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
and both are part of security I'd be
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um I'm going to
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
temporarily recess um cacr 5 public
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm going to open the public
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 136 for the
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of introductions only um so

to go right back to cacr 5 I do this
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
because Tuesday is the busiest day for
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
State reps to meet so they're sitting
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
here not in their committee so it gets
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
part part 11 I mean article 11 and
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
especially on the part where it it's
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually bolded and it's saying they are
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
absent from the city or town of which
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
they are inhabitants or by reason of
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
physical disability I'm pointing that
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
out because it's in in this part here it
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
actually goes down to say the actual
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for an absentee ballot all right
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have qualifications and we have
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
reasons all right so I just want to make
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
sure that you you're looking at the
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
words and watching them because we have
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
qualifications and reasons and I also
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
listed here on my testimony all the
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
different years the this article 11 was
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
amended and also created and if you read
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
through those I'm not going to for
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
saving time if you read through those
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
you can see none of those have been
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
changed for reason doesn't mean it can't
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
be it's just none of them have been so
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's a Poss possibility that could
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
happen in the future and I also want to
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
state I'm not against absente voting
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
voting at all I just want to make sure
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
the people have the say and not just
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislators the governor attorney
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
general or Secretary of State I want the
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
people to say what are the reasons we
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
want for absentee ballots not just us
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
the legislators bring it back to the
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
people so again there uh our
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
constitution was clear only two reasons
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
to receive an absentee ballot it was
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
also clear changes were made to the
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution to expand who is qualified
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
to vote I'm just pointing these things
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
up because it's really different and uh
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
it goes down I'm just saying the general
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
court uh is required to make laws for
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
qualified voters to cast their ballots
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then the Constitution lists those
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
qualifications and reasons we should be
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
only we should be only legislating by
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
law all right we should be giving it
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
back to the people to allow them to
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
change that Constitution yes we have to
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
bring it up of course through a cacr
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
pass all through all the steps it has to
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on the ballot for the
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
people to decide all right from there
 
00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going down to um ABS valot reasons
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that have been expanded by law when only
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Constitution should be
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
legislators to be expanding the reasons
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
to vote by absente B in one pointing out
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
here is we're going from absentee from
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
the city or town in physical
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities this is what we have right
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
now that I could find whether concerns
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
about safety traveling in the storm the
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic which the Secretary of State
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
Bill Gardner and attorney general Gordon
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
McDonald issue a joint
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
memorandum uh on April 10
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
2020 again that that's they just said
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
they're going to change it in the how
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be people weren't even get
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
a decision or or a vote a choice to vote
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
employment adult or child daycare
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
confinement prison and I didn't know
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
about this one attorney general's
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
address confidentiality program or are
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
protected by domestic violence so you
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
can see we've gone from two reasons in
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution which clearly pointed
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
out to now we made laws saying these
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
things are in laws or we're allowing the
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State or the Attorney
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
General say hey this is how I'm defining
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
what disability is all right so going
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
down from there last two points if we
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
want to expand the eligibility
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
requirements who is eligible and reasons
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
to receive an El uh absentee B one we
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
should be bringing it to the people all
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
right again see it last
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
point we need to move uh HP 418 to UT to
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
pass to allow the people to consent to
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
changes control our reasons for absentee
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
voting and we may need to further def
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
further definitions around absentee from
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
the city in town and physical disability
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
what that actually means that's what
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
might need further uh
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
definition I hope that it was clear
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
enough and that's what I just want to
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
pass out and I do have literature if you
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
want to just have it excellent if you
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%

huge pet peeve of mind uh so I'm going
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
hi good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jean Barnes I'm
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
moderator of board two and conquered for
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
your information during the covid
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
outbreak we had over 500 absentee
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
ballots all wars in the city had
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
conquered with the permission of the
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and Secretary
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
of State met and counted our absentee
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
balance we took the register and we
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted every name so that we knew
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
that we had the absentee ballot for that
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
person it would have been literally
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
impossible for us on Election Day to
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
process over 500 absentee ballots during
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the general election I had 142 we
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
started at 1:00 and we ended around
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
5: we take them very seriously each one
 
00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:25.029 align:start position:0%
5: we take them very seriously each one
is

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
hang looked up opened carefully make
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
make sure everything is signed make sure
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
everything is in
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
order it would be almost impossible for
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
us if we had any more over 200 to
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
process so that's my testimony excellent
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
requires voter to prove provide a

specific reason for requesting an
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot places an undo burden on

those who simply seek equal access to

The Ballot Box research demonstrates
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
that removing unnecessary restrictions
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
on absentee voting increases voter

Voters with disabilities experienced
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%

including signature matching and ballot

that every vote cast by mail is

legitimate while maintaining the

Integrity of our elections voting is a
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
fundamental right and the ability to
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
exercise that right should not depend on
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
one's health status Mobility or access
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%

convenience it is a matter of equity and
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
Justice by passing cacr 5 New Hampshire
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
will join the majority of states that
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that no voter should have to
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
justify their need for an absentee
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
ballot this amendment would remove an
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
outdated barrier and bring our States
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
election laws in line with modern
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%

PR Brian thank you uh I'm looking over
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
the form for requesting an absentee
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
ballot and there are a lot of options
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
here for why you need to request an
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot have you ever heard from
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
a person who said to you that they found
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
no option fit their need or they were
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
offended by any of them and could not
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
use this uh thank you for the question
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
um I have encountered people with
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities who don't feel that they
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
should have to disclose their disability
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
in order to receive an absentee
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you Miss EV

um thank you chairman Barry and members
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
is Kaye of stadio I'm a Durham voter and
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
public policy fellow with open democracy
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
representing 36,000 voters across the
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
state and I'm submitting testimony in
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
strong support of cacr 5 New Hampshire
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
is one of just 14 states that still
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
require an excuse to vote by absentee
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
this common Comm sense legislation would
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
bolster Democratic engagement in a truly
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan way policy change during the
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
height of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
that allowed anyone concerned about the
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
virus to vote by absentee ballot Rec
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
resulted in record-breaking turnout with
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
roughly 60,000 more voters than the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
previous presidential election
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
exercising their right to vote this is a
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
matter of meeting the needs of granite
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
Staters and not solely convenience in
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
the Live Free or Die State why should
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
the voter need to provide any reason to
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee ballot in 2018 57% of
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
Republicans across the country felt this
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
way compared to just 37% in
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
2024 citizens may have a variety of
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
individualized reasons that would
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
provoke them to vote by absentee ballot
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
whether that be because they don't want
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be bothered by either party
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
supporters on their way into their
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
polling place don't have the time to
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
stand in long lines or simply because it
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
enables them to ensure they cast their
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
vote before life gets in the way nobody
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
can predict a sick child a broken down
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle or a medical emergency that is
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
why no excuse absentee voting is a
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
uniquely bipartisan issue the ability to
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee ballot without an
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
excuse would allow hardworking BR
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to more reliably perform
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
their civic duties and should be a top
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
priority for
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives state election officials
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
have argued in the past that this change
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
will be well within their capacity to
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
implement and oversee unless some grave
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
oversight has been made I therefore see
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
no reason not to support this bill and I
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you to vote a to pass
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
on cicr 5 thank you thank you and will
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
be taking questions from the committee
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes are there questions from the
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none and
 
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
congratulations you are the closest to
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
your fully allotted time I think you got
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
within 3 seconds so it's going to be
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
hard to beat for other people um last up
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
ACLU good morning my name is Henry
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
clemento I'm the deputy legal director
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
of the American civil liberties Union of
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I support cacr 5 um
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
historically about 9% of New Hampshire
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
voters vote absentee uh that number went
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
to about 30% in 2020 when we had
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
expanded absentee palting due to covid
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
so I expect that if this cacr passes
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see a dramatic
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
overnight shift in the number of people
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
using uh absentee ballots nonetheless I
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
think what we will see is reduce lines
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
on Election Day reduce traffic um the
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
the need perhaps for fewer election
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
officials and staffs which would uh
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
decrease cost for local election
 
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.910 align:start position:0%
decrease cost for local election
officials

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
administering uh the elections because
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
they need fewer people I'd also say that
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has a robust uh process
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
for uh evaluating absentee ballots
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's affidavits that people sign the
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
the processing is done in public the
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
ballots are counted in public um it's
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
and that process wouldn't change so we
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be like Washington and Oregon
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
where the votes would be counted in
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
Regional centers they'd still be
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
processed in the same place that they
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
are now just perhaps hopefully at a
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
greater scale this is really about um
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
moving New Hampshire elections into the
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
20th at least the 20th maybe the 21st
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
century and and to uh respond to a
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
question that uh representative prudo
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
O'Brien had asked a previous speaker
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
about missing reasons to vote absentee I
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
think the committee will notice that
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
illness is not uh an excuse to vote
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
absentee and so we just we really don't

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
myself all right CAC R5 online had 163
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
in support 70 opposition um in person

hearing on cacr 5 we will resume the
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing on uh HB
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
418 um and I'm going to recognize
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you very much I continue
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
to be representative Timothy Horgan I
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
continue to represent straford County
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
District 10 the towns of Durham so I um
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill I don't think there's
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
any need to eliminate such a large
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
number of the of the except exception
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
for absentee B voting I know it's a long
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
list but if you fall into one of these
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
categories uh you know it's you you uh
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
it makes a huge difference to you
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
because if you want to vote and you're
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
denied the right to vote that's an
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
extremely upsetting uh experience and
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
totally unfair although and actually I
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
actually have a bill which is in
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
criminal justice about guns at the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
polling place um it's probably not going
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere but I even put in a uh a
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
provision in that one which would have
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
added another reason which is if you
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't want if you just can't bear to not
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
wear your gun at the polling place you
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
can vote absentee so but um you're
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
probably although that bill I can't
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
really speculate about what that
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee is doing but uh there's it's
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
more likely not to pass than the past so
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
I I the Constitutional argument which I
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
heard from the member a few minutes ago
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
I what it says in the constitution is a
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a floor so you at least have
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
to have absentee ballots for those two
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
reasons it's not that it's limited to
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
those two reasons and you know every one
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the these every one of these reasons
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
is extremely valid and they should stay
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
on the law books and of course uh I
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
would not and I would actually not be
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
totally opposed to no excuse absentee
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
voting but certainly um we should we
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
should certainly uh there's no none of
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
these excuses need to be delet deleted
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
from the the list of reasons why you
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
need an absentee ballot and
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's uh so vote no on this
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
bill it's uh just it's uh was probably
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
also going to be challenged on
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional grounds because uh you
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
know people take the right to vote very
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
seriously I mean sometimes some
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
elections you wonder why I mean I know
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes I wonder why I bothered but uh
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm still it's always better to vote
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
than not to vote so thanks okay thank
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
you will you be taking questions from
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
the committee are there questions from
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you okay
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
why thank you this is my first time
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
providing public testimony so I'm happy
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
to be here and thank you for including
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
us I represent ex I represent myself and
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
I'm from exor New Hampshire I strongly
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
oppose uh HB 418 because it limits the
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
number of people that do need absentee
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
Bots from being able to vote as was
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
already mentioned uh um New Hampshire
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
ranks 50th among states that are have
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
access ease ease of access for voting
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
this would make make an already very
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
very very low barrier or bar even lower
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
it would it would remove um protections
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
for people that have work conflicts and
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of work conflicts going
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
around here people work two or three
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
jobs to be able to afford expensive
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
housing they uh have I members of my
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
family work
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
three-day uh 12-hour shifts which can
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
exclude ability to be in person and
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's a work conflict and people work
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
as commuters from uh Boston or other for
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh distances which make it difficult to
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
be here on that single day of
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
voting if we look at what uh What uh
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
excuses or permissions uh people in
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
states of 49 and 48 in terms of uh
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
difficulty in Access what they permit in
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
their uh absentee ballots in addition to
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
what we already have they allow anyone
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
65 were older to have an absentee ballot
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
these are number 48 and 49 Mississippi
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
and Alabama in terms of difficulty in
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
voting so excluding more voters is not
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
the way to go these states also provide
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
permission for caregivers those with
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
illness those with disabilities
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
caregivers of um individuals with or
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
family members of uh individuals with
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
illness people who have experienced
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
death in their family within 5 days
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of reasons that
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
people cannot attend on the single day
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
of voting so making this more
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
restrictive is denying citizens rights
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
to vote thank you will you be taking
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee absolutely
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um next up is
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
not at all all right you're not the it's
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
not the first thing to be butchered by
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
me and it won't be the last probably not
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%

greatly appreciate the accommodations
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
Allowed by New Hampshire that have
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
allowed me to participate in the
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
Democratic process as well as show up

for my scheduled work shift in the past
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
I'm distressed that this bill would
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
remove accommodations for workers
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled to work long hours on voting
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%

even if I'm required to show up to work
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
and protect the health and lives of
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%

additionally as a healthcare provider
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
the more options we provide for voting
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
so that fewer potentially contagious
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
people are in the same room at the same
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%

Maori from Northampton um introducing

this bill sending the um and and thank
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity in all
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
seriousness uh the intent of this bill
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
comes from a real life situation it
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
happened in Northampton uh where a
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
resident came in uh his his wife had
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
just flown in with their son's absentee
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
ballot uh he ran to the polls got there
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
two minutes before it closed and he
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to hand in his son's
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot the moderator asked me
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
if there was any reason why we couldn't
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline for accepting
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots on the poll uh at the
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
polling location to the end of polls so
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
I looked into it there are two states um
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell that uh that limit
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
the uh deadline for when you can submit
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to 5:00 pm it seems
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
like most of them Most states extend
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
that period to 800 PM um a few uh and
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
and and I submit that everybody here
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
knows infinitely more than me uh it
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
seems that there's a wide range of times
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
where you could submit at the day of
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
poll so we're just suggesting here that
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
in order to get the greatest amount of
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
participation that extending the period
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
from 5:00 p.m. to the close of polls in
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%

00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%

00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
and you know staying uh longer at work
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
every so often happened but it's uh was
 
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.470 align:start position:0%
every so often happened but it's uh was
fairly

00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
unpredictable uh we kind of go in spurts
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
so if I was able to get
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh an absentee ballot without any uh
 
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.710 align:start position:0%
uh an absentee ballot without any uh
great

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
details that would have been so much
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
better it was upsetting that I didn't
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
get to vote that day and please do not
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
forget how voters who requested an
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot during the worst of
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
covid had to choose disabil even though
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
a voter right in front of me when I was
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh helping at Town
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
Hall um not
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
disabled and I realized uh you know
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of uh uh quick
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
decisions uh to
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
cover uh voting and procedures during
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
the worst of co uh but still uh when you
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
would have to tell a registered voter
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
they're definitely not disabled but it's
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
necessary to cross that check that
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
off and so you know voters were
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
apprehensive and kind of suspicious uh
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
of uh their personal
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
information and uh you know why do I
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
there was uh several why do I have to uh
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
check off disability I'm fine Mr s I'm
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
gonna have to ask you to bring your
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
remarks to a conclusion okay
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
sorry and if there was reasonable and
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
sensible options to choose from on the
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
absentee application I wouldn't have had
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%

with
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities this legislation is an
 
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
affront to the very Foundation of our
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
democracy the right to vote is not a
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
privilege reserved only for those with
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to stand in line on
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
Election Day it is a fundamental right
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
that must be accessible to all eligible
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
voters most concerning this bill places
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on people with
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities while the legislation still
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
allows absentee voting for disability
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
related reasons narrowing the law
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
isolates and stigmatizes voters with
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities the ability to access
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots should not require
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to disclose their medical
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
conditions nor should we create a system
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
that forces voters to prove the
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of their personal obligations
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
before casting their ballot restricting
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
absentee voting is a direct attack on
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
the civic participation of those already
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
marginalized in our electoral system in
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
a state that provi that Prides itself on
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
voter engagement and participation HB
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
418 moves Us in the wrong direction at
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
AEL New Hampshire we believe in building
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire that is inclusive and
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
Equitable hb14 is neither I urge this
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee to reject this harmful
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and instead focus on
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
policies that expand rather than
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
restrict the right to vote our democracy
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
is the strongest when every eligible
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
voter can participate without
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary obstacles standing in their
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you and will we be
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
taking questions from the committee sure
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you next up
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
Joan Dari Dari
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
law thank you to the chair and the
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
committee to give me give me this
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Joan
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
dargy and I'm speaking on behalf of the
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
Association and we are opposed to this
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
bill basically the language that's been
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
added um since 2020 has um allowed those
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
voters that are very black and white to
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
be able to find a reason on here I'm
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
taking care of a loved one I'm not out
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
of town but due to the fact that I need
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
to I'm a caretaker and can't leave that
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
person alone at all um it it a lot they
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
feel like they are doing they are
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
legally um able to request an app
 
00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.910 align:start position:0%
legally um able to request an app
ballot

00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
um and taking these options away would
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
make it very um stringent and those
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
people that are that are very concerned
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
with doing everything legally would no
 
00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
longer be able to request an
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
absentee that's it okay will you be
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
taking questions sure are there
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you um you had mentioned
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
about uh a caretaker
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
um we all pretty much know when voting
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
is I personally take care of someone 247
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
but if I knew I had to be somewhere
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
would you be able to find someone for
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
the hour to two hours to go and vote is
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
my question so I I personally myself
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
took care of my dad for 15 years that
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
had Alzheimer's and there would come
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
those times when you could not get
 
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
those times when you could not get
anybody

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
else and when you're the sole caretaker
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
you you don't know what kind of
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
condition they're going to be in that
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
day and they might not accept somebody
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
that they do not recognize some days
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
were good some days were bad so really
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
in that case that that doesn't really
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
work with somebody say with Alzheimer's
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you next up is Liz
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Barry for this
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I'm Liz torelli I'm
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
president of the League of Women Voters
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and as you can guess I
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because our mission is
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
to empower voters and this bill does
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
just the opposite but I want to talk
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
since so many other people have cited
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
the specific instances in which people
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh need to vote absentee in in order to
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
exercise their fundamental right I would
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
like to point out that this legislature
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
has over the past 10 or 15 years enacted
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
some very positive legislation and I
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
would hate to see you now go back on
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
that for instance after we had terrible
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
storms for three years on town meeting
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
day you enacted a law that allowed
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
people to vote the day before at their
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
Town Hall a vote and absentee ballot
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
because it would have been too dangerous
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
or impossible for them if they drove
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
crappy little cars like mine to get to
 
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.470 align:start position:0%
crappy little cars like mine to get to
the

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%

word to use I apologize and I will have
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
to apologize to my car when I get out
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%

get an absentee ballot which is their
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
right you also recognized um that the
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
unpredictable work hours of people shows
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
they're being prudent when they apply
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
for an absentee ballot that is they're
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
not sure they'll be out of town but they
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
recognize this is a problem so please
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%

director for the New Hampshire State
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging it's a legislative
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
commission created to advise the
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
governor and legislature on issues
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
related to aging so uh the Commission on
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
Aging advises against removing several
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
previous abs voter justifications older
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
adults are a growing proportion of our
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
communities from 2020 to 2030 the
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of New Hampshire citizens age
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
65 or older will grow from 19% to 27%
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
becoming nearly 30% of our state's
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
population weather related concerns are
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
not an
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
insignificant uh uh for older adults
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
data compiled by from the New Hampshire
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
falls risk reduction task force
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
indicates that New Hampshire in New
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire falls are the leading cause of
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
of death for older adults age 65 plus
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
with 249 deaths in 2020 in 2019 almost
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
13,000 older adults went to emergency
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
departments and over 4,300 older adults
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
were admitted to New Hampshire hospitals
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
for fall related injuries costing um um
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh cost exceeding $294
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
million uh this commission suggests
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
encouraging older adults to consider
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots when faced with um
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging more older adults to
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
consider absentee ballots when faced
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
with inclement weather rather than
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
requiring them to take a risk to exerise
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
exercise their right to vote moving on
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
to unpaid caregivers these are people
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
who care for their spouses their
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
children their friends um uh I mean it's
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh of older adults family caregivers
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
fill an essential role in our fractured
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
long-term services and support system a
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
2023 ARP report suggested that in our
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
state in 2021 there were uh 100 168,000
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
unpaid caregivers in New Hampshire
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
providing an economic value of collectiv
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
leave almost 2.8 billion many caregivers
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
cannot leave the person they are caring
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
for unless they can um uh find another
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
qualified person who can and this could
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
be exceptionally challenging as you
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
heard um many would not be providing the
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
care themselves if if they if there were
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
other options and finally I just want to
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
mention about healthcare workers that
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
was raised already many work 12-hour
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
shifts and and they care for all of us
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you will
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
hearing we are going to be able to dig
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
out of this hole before lunch because
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of pink cards to the
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
remaining bills we're just 418 is taking
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit of churn and burn um so I'm
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
going to recess the public hearing on
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
418 and we're going to open up the
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%

minutes you know you don't have a you
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
don't have one that I I would uh I think
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%

I'm the chair of legislative
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
Administration uh although I used to
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
serve on this Committee in the vice
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
chair seat um I wanted to introduce you
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
and give you a opportunity to maybe
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
shift gears a little bit away
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
from absentee ballot on the day of
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
election or the week before this shifts
 
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
this bill shifts the thinking to 60 days
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
election um and deals with a very small
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
slice of the uh of the absente ballot
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
world uh it Deals Only with
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
mailin um applications that are
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
requesting a ballot to be mailed to an
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
address other than the address on the
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
checklist and if on your package uh OS
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of put together this in a strange
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
way but on the back of the first page
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see a chart and that's what I
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
want to uh concentrate my testimony
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
on um this is information actual
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
information from uh 2016 election um we
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
gathered it uh with at then it was the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
dep um deputy secretary of state scandin
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
um so that tells you gives you a little
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
of the history um but we had uh we
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
noticed in the law while I was sitting
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
on Election law that um there was no
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Secretary of State
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
to review um where absentee ballots were
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%

01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
would prepare an analysis of the 2016
 
01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:31.229 align:start position:0%
would prepare an analysis of the 2016
absentee

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%

absentee ballot addresses or information
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
um these are just strict stly absentee
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
ballots that were requested by mail and
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
sent outside New Hampshire to Common
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
addresses and you'll notice from this
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
chart there are quite a few that are
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
sent to Common addresses so um the very
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
first line says 23 ballots were sent to
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
a single uh unnamed address outside New
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then it goes all the way
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
down two times 21 ballots were sent to
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the same address three times 19 ballots
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
2 * 7 17 ballots and we have no idea
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
where those ballots were being sent and
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
the and um Secretary of State's office
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't know where those ballots were
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
sent it is not as I've said here in
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
summary this is not proof of voter fraud
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
but it is certainly something that we we
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
should look into um I think either party
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
would be interested in knowing whether
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
those 23 ballots were sent to an address
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
that happens to be a um an
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
RNC um Committee in Dayton Ohio or uh or
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
even the 21 ballots being sent to a a um
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
a DNC uh committee room in Mobile
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
Alabama um CU un tighten um but it is uh
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of Investigation that's what
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it requires the
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to have access in
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
order to prepare a report showing where
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
the 20 most common uh addresses were
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
where multiple ballots were sent and
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close my testimony and
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
take questions if you have them are
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hill for taking my
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
question um you focused your testimony
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
on the reporting piece but didn't really
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
address what's in Roman numeral one uh
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
which is making it available to the
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
public and my concern is with privacy so
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking if you considered privacy
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
concerns because this is an aggregate
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
report not an individual report that's
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
correct um thank you for your question
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
the um the idea of that um these would
 
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
be set up um privately was um back in
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
history when there was cons conc Ern
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
that people requesting absentee ballots
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
would be they used they actually used to
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
be posted right on the door of the
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
voting place um so it seemed logical for
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh nefarious people to take a look at
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
who's not going to be in town at the
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
time and uh and and rob their houses so
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um that was that was the impetus with
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
the idea originally to to make the these
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
lists private that's why we've gone to
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
the 60 days quite frankly to make it um
 
01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
after the time that uh the election has
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
has been um handled I have no problem if
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
the if the committee wants to make it
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
180 days or 365 days it really doesn't
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
matter to me the point is that um that
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
we would have the information be able to
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
look through for where these addresses
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
were that's the the critical part for me
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
I should also point out that in within
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation is the is the caveat for
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
those people that have um hidden
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
addresses for protective U Services so
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's in there further questions from
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
you repres
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
C yes thank you I was just wondering
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
whether this was intended
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
to um be available for the general
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
public to inspect or just Secretary of
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
State um
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
truly I
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your question I really
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
don't care um if it is available uh to
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State you'll notice in
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
here um I've not indicated where that
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
report would actually be sent or given
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I I truly don't care if uh I want him
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
to prepare the report and I want him to
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether there are addresses
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
that are of concern and I would assume
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
um any any interest on his part um would
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
then be turned over to the Attorney
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
General's office so uh whether it's
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
private or not um if if the committee
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
would prefer that it remain strictly in
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary uh State's hands I'm fine
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
with that um but uh whether it goes to
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
the public or not doesn't matter to
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
me further questions from the committee
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
much always a pleasure to be at an
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
election law yeah we got a much better
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
Vice chair now I'm just saying but um
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
going to uh it's okay representative
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna going to recess uh going
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
to recess House Bill 158 the public
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and reopen the public hearing on
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 114 418 Christina Fitzpatrick
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Barry and members
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Christina
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick I'm the state director for
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
AARP New Hampshire and I am here today
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
to testify against HB
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
418 and it would eliminate many of the
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
qualified reasons for requesting an
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot I want to focus on the
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
one about um people with caregiving
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities there are 168,000
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
people people in the state who take
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility for caring for an adult
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
loved one with either a chronic or an
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
acute health condition these are people
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
who fill a very demanding role that can
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
be very difficult it can be um there
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
might be a case where somebody cannot
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
leave their loved one um because the the
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
person has such extreme needs and
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
finding somebody who can take care of
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the person who can fulfill those needs
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
can be difficult if not impossible
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
especially given the workforce shortages
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
in our state in addition people with
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
chronic health conditions can easily
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
have something happen on Election Day
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
that would um require a doctor's visit a
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or otherwise impede the
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
caregiver from um going to the voting
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
Place life is unpredictable and people
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
who want to make sure that they can cast
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
a ballot should be allowed to do so I
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider the
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
negative impact that this bill would
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
have on family caregivers and vote
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
against House Bill
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
418 will you be taking questions from
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
the committee yes are there questions
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
next up is Olivia zinc with open
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
Perry uh good morning members of the
 
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc um from Franklin New
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but I'm reading Bob Perry's
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
um uh testimony from straford uh it
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
should be in front of you so I'm just
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
going to paraphrase um he writes in
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to House Bill 418 um
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
citing article one of New Hampshire
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution the words are in front of
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
you um those 27 words lie an important
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
principle that is more guiding it is a
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
bold principle that establishes the
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between elected officials
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
and their constituents heavily weighted
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
towards the people ensuring that people
 
01:16:55.639 --> 01:16:56.709 align:start position:0%
towards the people ensuring that people
have

01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
have

shared democracy um Bob urges itl um and
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to share quickly a personal
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
story um my dad before he passed was a
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
retired veteran um he was not disabled
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
but he was wheelchair bound in his later
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
life and he would not check off a box to
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
say he was disabled because he felt very
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
strongly what that meant and so I do
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
think that restricting it just to those
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
D disabled will impact people um that
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
are in the category of my father a
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
retired veteran who is wheelchair bound
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know my my dad's now no longer with
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
us but um um people like him will be
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
harmed I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you next up
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
where thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
Trumble from where I just want to go to
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
the original speaker who said the
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was that the
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
constitution laid out two Provisions for
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and that it shouldn't
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
be up to you to add anything on it
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
should only be up to a constitution it
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
should be up to the people that's what
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
the first Speaker said so I just was
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
checking the constitution of our state
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a floor and
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
a ceiling in the Constitutional article
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
11 there is some things that are
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
ceilings no person shall have the right
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
to vote if they committed treason so the
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution has Provisions in there
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
that say no then the next provision is
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
the general court shall provide by law
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
for voting for qualified voters and lays
 
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
out the two categories for absentee
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
ballot that's a floor had the
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution intended it to be for those
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
two and only for those two it would have
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
said the general court shall provide for
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
these voting for only these two reasons
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
I mean they clearly did it when it came
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
to setting ceilings for treason and
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
other things there's nothing in the
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says you can't the
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislature couldn't
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
extend those categories and if the
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution wanted it to be that way
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
only two it would have said to just like
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
it has with the ceiling for crimes like
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
treason and things like that so I just
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that the original
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Logic for this bill doesn't really hold
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
the Constitution does not set a sealing
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
on those two examples it's a floor thank
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
you will you be taking questions of
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
course yes sir actually found your
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
argument to be very thought provocating
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth don't necessarily
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
say I agree with it but it's definitely
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking um other questions
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
from the committee it's just a new art
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard that one yet it's a
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
nice one all right thank you Mr Trumble
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
estra it's the E it's the EF gets me I
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%

01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Kaye of stro I am a Durham
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
voter and public policy fellow with open
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
democracy we're a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
representing 36,000 voters across the
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
state and I am submitting testimony and
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
vehement opposition to HB 418 this bill
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
is a blatant attempt to disenfranchise
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
voters across the state and it does not
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
seek to pretend otherwise New
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's eligibility requirements for
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee are already some of
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
the most restrictive in the country and
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
hp48 seeks to go even further it removes
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
religious observ work and child care
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
obligations and even extreme weather
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
events like snowstorms as valid reasons
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
for receiving an absentee ballot the
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate reality is that not everyone
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
has the luxury to be able to take off
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
work to show up in person at their
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
polling place this does not mean they do
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
not still deserve to exercise their
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote this bill
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
is the latest in a flurry of attempts to
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
make it harder for granite Staters to
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
vote under the false pretense that
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee is somehow less
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
secure in fact as representative Lane
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the Brennan Center
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
notes that cases of voter fraud related
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
to absentee are so rare that it is more
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
likely that someone will be struck by
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
lightning enacting restrictions on
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
absentee voting just 5 years after
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
record-breaking voter turnout was
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
attributed to their widespread use is a
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
clear attempt to stifle the voices of
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
the electorate and I urge you to vote HB
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
418 at expedient to legislate thank you
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%

today in opposition to House Bill 418
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
which would unnecessarily restrict
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
access to absentee ballots in the
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%

residents can vote absentee uh this
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%

01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
hours or have multiple jobs would be
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
forced to misw work in order to vote in
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
person which honestly just may not be
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
feasible for many especially those in uh
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
low income or rural areas and as you've
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
heard caregivers who are already
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
juggling demanding responsibilities at
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
home would face a similar challenge
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
these groups are already among the most
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable when it comes to voting
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
access and House Bill 418 would create
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
further barriers making it even harder
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
for them to participate in the
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
Democratic process absentee voting has
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
been secure reliable process for years
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't benefit one party over another
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
but rather ensures that all voters are
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
able to have the opportunity to
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
participate regardless of their ability
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
to show up and vote in person winter
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
storms natural disasters and other
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstances can prevent
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
people from voting safely uh in this
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
bill's repeal of absentee voting during
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
winter storm warnings could strip of an
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
important Safeguard to ensure that f
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability to write uh the ability
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
to vote without putting their safety at
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
risk um by further narrowing already
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive qualifications this bill
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
could prevent people for who have
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons for not voting uh at
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
all this bill could particularly hurt
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
young families working parents
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
caregivers who are already facing
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
challenges uh balancing their personal
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and professional lives um and for these
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask you to vote against House
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 418 I would take any questions are
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%

01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%

campaign for voting rights which is a
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
project of America votes um we are here
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to House Bill 418 as
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan Coalition one of our core
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
goals is that ever in values is that
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
every Gran stator should have the right
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
to vote um under this legislation folks
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
who are unable to vote on Election Day
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
because of some of the provisions that
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
are being removed or would be removed
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
from the law may not be able to vote at
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
all uh because they are unable to make
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
it in person but they no longer have an
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
excuse under the law to be able to vote
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
absente um and we're very concerned
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
about limiting that access uh this
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
includes you know folks who have been
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
talked about today parents and other
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
caregivers especially who are full-time
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
caregivers or have unforeseen
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances come up as can happen in
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
full-time caregiving no longer able to
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
be a vote absentee um also people who
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
are working and have long shifts like
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
nurses and doctors um I've submitted
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
written testimony from Paul King III of
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
eing who is a career firefighter um and
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
talks about the lengthy shifts um under
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
this bill if folks are only absent or
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
disabled but think about the absence um
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um from the town they
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
are no longer able to vote absentee we
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
have folks like doctors firefighters
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
police officers other First Responders
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
who might be in the town they are not
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
absent from their Town however they are
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
working an extended shift or on call
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
beyond the hours of the polling place
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
and under this legislation those folks
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
would not be able to anymore have a box
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
to check to be able to cast ballot um
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
absentee so we already post this bill
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
because this simp it simply seems to be
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
just restricting who can vote
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
restricting the options of folks who
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to vote because they are
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
eligible to do so um and we ask that you
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
oppose it um and I'm happy to take
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh are there questions from
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
the committee none and you get the award
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
you had three seconds left so you you've
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's that's uh roll
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
that over to later we we are doing you
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
can have your three seconds later sure
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh we are doing prices rights rules so
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
if you go over it doesn't count um all
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
right last up is Henry ktz from the
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
ACLU good morning good morning I'm Henry
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
clemento I'm the deputy legal director
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the American civil liberties of Union
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we oppose this bill for
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
two reasons um by removing all these
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
excuses that people use to vote absentee
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is an attack on the right to vote
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's also an attack on religious liberty
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
because it prevents people from uh
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
complying with religious obligations
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
that currently would allow them to vote
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
absentee and now would require them to
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
vote in person and then just personally
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a dad of a feral three-year-old um
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
who goes to school in the woods in Maine
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
and um on Election Day in 2024 he was
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
sick um I think those of you who have
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
small children in your lives know that
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
people get sick very frequently when
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
they are three and very frequently in
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the winter time he was sick my wife
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
who's an assistant professor at uh UNH
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
law had uh full-time work obligations
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
and so there I was trying to figure out
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
how I was going to vote and take care of
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
a very angry and misbehaving
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
three-year-old um and how am I going to
 
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
get him to watch TV and drink uh drink
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
pedite while taking him to the polls so
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
um people have talked about the impact
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
that this has on caregivers but just
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
from personal experience it's real so we
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I'm happy to take any
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions from the
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none um thank you Mr
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
Richard I don't have a card for you but
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
you did raise your
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
hand okay I still can't find it you U
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
please come give your testimony real
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
fast and then but if you could fill out
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
the pink card after you're done um so we
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
can conclude this but I don't want to
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's why you went after the lobby so I
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
didn't know about you the lobby always
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
go last in my committee no problem thank
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
you so much for hearing me again um let
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
me cover this quickly the backstory that
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
you need to hear is the Supreme Court
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
has already ruled on this matter and
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
before the Civil war or during the Civil
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
War the issue was raised can the
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
legislature authorize absentee voting
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
and they said no World War I same issue
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
they go back to the Supreme Court for an
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
advisory opinion and the court tells
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
them we told you 50 years ago the
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has no authority to create
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
absentee voting 1942 instead they got
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
the news and they went ahead and put the
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
provisions in there in 1942 to amend our
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
state constitution so uh PRI even though
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
prior testimony is alluded to the fact
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
that there are these other exemptions
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
they got there by Amendment so my point
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
to this committee this morning is simple
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
if it took an amendment to the state
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
constitution to change and create the
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
two exemptions we have then I would
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
recommend that regardless of what you
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
think about the those who are against
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation the solution is a cacr
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
simple if you want to change and Grant
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
more power look we're not a democracy
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
we're a constitutional republic part one
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
first uh of the Bill of Rights says very
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
clearly all government of right not some
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
all government of right originates from
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
the people is founded in their consent
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
the last sentence in the state
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
constitution provides that the document
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
can't be changed without the consent of
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
the people so that's really the Nexus of
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
my why I'm in support of the bill we
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
should only have the two Provisions this
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
body is only permitted to pass statutes
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
and regulations controlling the
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
state constitution thank you questions

01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
clerk in Derry
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for hearing my
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
testimony so in November at 7:15 p.m. um
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
my pole workers threw their arm up in
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
the air looking for the clerk so I come
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
over and there's this woman who's in
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
tears so her daughter goes to college in
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island she had gone down that
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
previous weekend and she had picked up
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
her daughter's absentee ballot she had
 
01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
promised her daughter that she'd drop it
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
off at Town Hall on Monday and she
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
forgot so she figured she'd bring it
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
with her when she voted she was supposed
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
to come earlier in the day to vote but
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
got caught up in something at work and
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
voted voted on her way home so she came
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
in she voted and after she voted she
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to turn in her daughter's
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and I had to stand there
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
and tell this woman I am so
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
sorry I I I can't accept the ballot it
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
is after 5:00
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
p.m. and after she railed at me and
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
yelled at me about this arbitrary rule
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
that she seemed to think the town of
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
Derry had instituted um I explained to
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
her that it's state
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
statute and I encouraged her to reach
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
out to our state
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
representatives um to get the law
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
changed um and that if ever this uh came
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
up I would support it well last Thursday
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
she came into town hall she licensed her
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
dog and she goes do you remember me and
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
I said I do and she goes I heard there's
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
a bill and I said I know to extend SP
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
the time I'm going to be in conquered
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
anyway I will testify in support so I do
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
know that there are some clerks who
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
don't like this bill and some other
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
election officials who might not like it
 
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
all the way to the end of the polls um
 
01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
for this resident who was
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
affected um trying to do the right thing
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
to hand deliver her daughter's ballot
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
because it probably wouldn't have made
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
it in time in the mail from Rhode Island
 
01:34:56.669 --> 01:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
I am here in support and I will take any
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions are questions from the
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my question is do
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
you anticipate this um in the longterm
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh having a lot of ballots coming in at
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
the last minute that would delay the
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
close of polls I don't really think so
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
we don't get a lot of ballots I mean we
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
had over 18,000 voters in November and
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
we had a handful of ballots delivered on
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
Election Day um I think most people get
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
them into the clerk you know the day
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
before um I I I don't know that this is
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
going to be huge uh I just do know that
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
this poor woman was heartbroken for
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
herself and her daughter um and in
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get her daughter's vote in
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
just missed the deadline further
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh after that will be Daniel
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
Healey Joan
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
dargy New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
Association and as Tina mentioned we are
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill there was
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
concern on behalf of multiple clerks
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
that having it up until the time the
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
close of polls could be um problematic
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
so we were just suggest ing an amendment
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
of maybe up to a half hour before the
 
01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:28.350 align:start position:0%
of maybe up to a half hour before the
polls

01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
polls
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
close because at obviously when the
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
polls are closing we're all very busy
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get ready for accounting and
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
if people are trying to find me to
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
submit an absentee that could delay the
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
process okay will you be taking
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions sure any other questions from
 
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.390 align:start position:0%
questions sure any other questions from
the

01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this is sort of a
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
followup to the previous speaker um if
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
you if we limit it in any way to before
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
the polls close are there going to be
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
some people that would be affected
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
because they came in at the last minute
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
or they were waiting in line at 7 o'cl
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
close

01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
um if well the poll if they're waiting
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
in line the polls don't close until
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
they've at the last person's voted well
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
until the last person's gotten through
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
the line I should say forther questions
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative P
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you for coming and thank
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony it's very
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
interesting this the situation um but if
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
we amended it to half an hour before the
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
polls close I think I have the same
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
concerns as representative C wouldn't it
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
create the same problem that we are
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
seeking to
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
fix that somebody could come in at 7:30
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
if the polls close at 88 and then be
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
told sorry you're too late and then
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
they' the same exact problem but there
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
is some responsibility on behalf of the
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
absentee voters I mean they can get
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
those ballots so much in
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
advance and I I do understand there are
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
issues and we we don't have that many
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
but if we say that we're going to allow
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
until polls close what I would be afraid
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
of is an entire group of say college
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
students and durm all saying we can drop
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
these off at 8 o'cl although it
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be them dropping it off
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
because they shouldn't be there but
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know there's I'm just trying to
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
look out for it is a very busy time and
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of forms to fill out at
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the night and we are
 
01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
preparing to get organized so that we
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
are publicly counting all these ballots
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
in front of everybody and having even
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
three people show up with an absentee
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
ballot at 8:00 could be disruptive to
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
that process further questions from the
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you next up
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
esto uh Dan hilly nashwa city clerk um I
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of echo what Joan just
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned um I am in favor of this
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill I would like it to have some type
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
of buffer before the end of the polls
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
still giving the voters additional time
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
to turn in their ballots but also giving
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
the election workers um that little
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
buffer and I say that because in Nowa we
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
have Wards we have nine Wards and during
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
the state primary election the post
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
office um they were instructed to bring
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the ballots to uh city clerk's office
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we would disperse them um they did
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
not do that at 5:00 p.m. they or close
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
to 5: they brought them all to one
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
location so my fear is that if the
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
ballots are dropped off at the wrong
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
location we need time to get them to the
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
other location I think 30 minute buffer
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do that so we had
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
ballots that were meant for say Ward one
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
brought to Ward seven the post office
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
not realizing that um there are
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
different ballots uh depending on the
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
location depending on the ward so I have
 
01:40:12.669 --> 01:40:12.679 align:start position:0%
a fear that if it's right at the close
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
of polls and something like that happens
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
where they're all brought to that um one
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
spot that they're not going to get
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
dispersed to the other locations prior
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the close of the polls and to be
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
correctly counted that's why I would
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
like a buffer I would be okay with the
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
bill as is but my preference would be
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
some type of of buffer in there um for
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
little issues like that and as Joan
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the election workers once you
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
start get to you know half hour to the
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
close of polls they're starting to kind
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
of gear up for closing out the election
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
getting their staff in line um and so
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of the questions ear we don't
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
typically have a ton of absentee ballots
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
that are hand delivered by you know the
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
delivery agent on Election Day I do not
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
like having to tell the voter it's 510
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
and we cannot count your spouse's ballot
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
because it's in RSA it's 5 it's 5:00 P
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
PM you're here at 5:10 so with that I'd
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
be open to any questions other questions
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent PR O'Brien
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for coming today it's always
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
nice to see the local folks
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh would this inhibit the ability for
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
the public to observe the counting of
 
01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.669 align:start position:0%
the public to observe the counting of
absentee

01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
ballots so the processing of absentee
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
ballots um on Election Day is 1: p.m.
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise notice you can do it
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
two hours after the polls open unless
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's the you know the
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
petition um and that is noticed once the
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are all processed for
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the day the moderator if they get uh
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
an additional ballot dropped off they
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
would make an announcement um to the
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
voters present that we just received an
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
additional absentee ballot we'll be
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
bringing it over for processing um and
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
then the anyone there could observe it
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
at that time further questions from the
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
gusov uh thank you U not receiving an
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot does it State on the
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot when it needs to be
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
turned in yes that is correct so are
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
instructions given to the voters um with
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
their ballot um we find these you know
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
we have people coming into the office
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
and doing the absente ballot in person
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're finding these instructions all
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
over the place so I don't while it is
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
the voter's
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility they see that extra paper
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many of them
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually read that we get a lot of calls
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
on instructions that are on that slip
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
and so I know it it is partially the
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
voters responsibility but a lot of
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
Voters even with that slip included
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at it we get calls
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
constantly on things that could be
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
answered just by reading that in uh
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
instruction sheet and that's a standard
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
form um provided by the secretary of
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
state that all clerks should be
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
including with the absentee ballot when
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
they either hand it out or mail it
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
out further questions from the
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
toner thank you um I just want to know
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
in your experience um doing what you do
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
how many times have you had to Discount
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot because it wasn't
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
delivered by
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
five I would say
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
probably under five times I've done I've
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
been doing elections for nine years um
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
the last three years have been in the
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
city I not at the polling location all
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
day um but I know when we do the um
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
reports at the end of the night um there
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
might an occasional delivered after the
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
5:00 p.m. but it's it's a very low
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
number that actually bring them in after
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
5:00 pm from what I've noticed thank you
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%

136 this Common Sense legislation is
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
long overdue by not accepting ballots
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
received past five the state effectively
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
countless Granite Staters being
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
blatantly cast aside these hardworking
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
individuals deserve to have their voices
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
heard regardless of whether or not they
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
are able to vote in person the reasoning
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
behind the original statute was probably
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
intended to allow election workers the
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
time to process absentee ballots which
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
it may be in doing on Election Day
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
however I find this reasoning to be
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
inherently flawed while we all know
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
election workers are faced with the
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
essential yet incredibly taxing job of
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
counting ballots late into the evening I
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
find it difficult to believe that
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 2hour stoppage does much at
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
all to alleviate this pressure New
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is just one of 14 states that
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
does not allow election workers to begin
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
counting absentee ballots until the
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
close of polls this means that the large
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
quantity of absentee ballots received
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
since becoming available 30 days prior
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
must all be safe for counting at the end
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the night anyway seeing that our
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
election workers have successfully
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
completed this task year after year I
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
wonder just how many absentee ballots
 
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
would have to come in past 5:00 p.m. to
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
completely derail the process and as
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
we've heard not many come in after 5:00
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
p.m. if the goal of the original statute
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
was intended to ease the burden of
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
election workers in addition to
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill I recommend
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
allowing absentee ballots to be counted
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
before polls close on Election Day by
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 344 later today and I
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to please vote a to
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
pass on hb136 to ensure that every
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%

not yet but we do we are in possession
of

01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%

step apologies this bill takes a common
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
sense step toward eliminating potential
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest in the ballot
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
counting process by prohibiting
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
candidates except for those running for
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
positions essential to election
 
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
Administration from participating in the
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
counting of ballots before election day
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
HB 464 helps ensure that our electoral
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
process remains above reproach the
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of any democratic
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
system is that elections must be both
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
fair and also be perceived as fair by
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
the public if voters see that
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
individuals with a direct personal stake
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
in the outcome of an election are
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
involved in pre-election ballot counting
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
it risks undermining trust in the
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
process whether or not any actual
 
01:48:18.719 --> 01:48:20.109 align:start position:0%
process whether or not any actual
wrongdoing

01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
occurs even the mere appearance of a
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
conflict interest is enough to erode
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
faith in our democracy and HB 464
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
eliminates that risk by reinforcing the
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
impartiality of ballot counting some may
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
argue that town moderators and election
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
officials will struggle to manage the
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
counting of blank ballots in advance of
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
the election if candidates for office
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
are not permitted to assist in the
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
process however this concern is
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
misplaced Town Lacrosse New Hampshire
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
have long relied on trained election
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
officials volunteers and legally
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
designated ballot clerks to handle these
 
01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:53.390 align:start position:0%
designated ballot clerks to handle these
responsibilities

01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they will continue to do so the
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
argument that elections cannot function
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
without candidates counting blank
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
ballots with their own names on them
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
suggested undue Reliance on those with
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
vested interests a notion that should
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
raise concern and not support by
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
enacting H Bill HB 464 we send a clear
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
message to the people of New Hampshire
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
our election our excuse me our elections
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%

Integrity free from even the perception
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
of bias this billes does not make any
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
accusations it only seeks to make
 
01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:27.639 align:start position:0%
improvements it safeguards our
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
Democratic Traditions while ensuring
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
that every voter has a reason to trust
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
the process as well as the results I
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
um my name is Sarah Burke Cohen I
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
Association this is on HB 158 correct
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am okay um nhma opposes this bill
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
um we have a few issues with it um
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
certainly we have some issues with the
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
fact that um the the ballot clerk will
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
be required to uh identify confirm and
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh validate uh whether a 173 RSA 173b
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
protective order is valid or not um we
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that is well outside the scope of
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh what a ballot Clerk or a supervisor
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the checklist should be doing um
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
secondly we feel like adding the burden
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
on to our you know the municipality to
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
have these P these lists ready within 60
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
days is is burdensome and it also causes
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
um some issues with regard to the
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
protective orders um if th if someone is
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
left on the list and it goes public and
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
it's a mistake it could be problematic
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
for that person um safety and Welfare
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
wise um so nhma opposes this bill will
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%

01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%

committee members my name is David
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
Trumble and from the town OFW and I
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I'll start with the
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
basic arguments this fold first is that
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
this deals with the right to vote it's a
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
right it's not a privilege and we should
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
be very careful about reducing people's
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
ability to exercise the right to vote
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
second is that there's no evidence of
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
fraud this has been demonstrated
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
throughout this hearing today the chance
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
of absentee fraud is less than the
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
chance of getting hit by lightning as
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
heard the issue is the citizenship
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
papers the Brennan Center for justice
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
has been long active in this field and
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
they just put out a report in
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
2024 asking people about uh their
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
ability to access their right to vote
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they had the
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
documents to prove their citizenship a
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
passport a birth certificate
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers readily available
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
our they said quote our Research
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
indicates that more than 9% of American
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
citizens of voting age 21 million people
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide don't have proof of
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship readily available there are
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
myriad reasons for this the documents
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
might be in the home of another family
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
member or in a safety deposit box at
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
least 3.8 million don't have these
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
documents at all often because they were
 
01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
lost destroyed or stolen they also found
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
that while over 8% of self-identified
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
white American citizens don't have these
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
CI these documents readily available
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
that number is nearly 11% among
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
Americans of color so what is 9%
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
translate to in in New Hampshire if you
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
get about 800,000 votes in a major
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
election that's 70 2,000 people who
 
01:56:25.629 --> 01:56:25.639 align:start position:0%
would not be able to vote now I don't
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
know which town you're all from you're
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
from different towns all over the state
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
but if you're from a town of 1,000
 
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
people that means 90 people in your town
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
will lose their right to vote if you're
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
from a town of 10,000 people that means
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
900 people would lose their right to
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
vote it doesn't make any sense there's
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
no fraud there's no reason for this bill
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
it would take away people's right to
 
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
vote there's nothing in our state
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
constitution that requires these papers
 
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
be provided in order to get it absente
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
Bel we already went through the state
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
constitution it doesn't have anything
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
like that in there there's no reason for
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
this bill but if you represent a
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
thousand people in your town you're
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
telling 90 of them that they will not be
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to vote in the next election thank
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you actually dead on zero
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
congratulations we have the winner for
 
01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
the day um are there any questions for
 
01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:16.870 align:start position:0%
the day um are there any questions for
Mr

01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
Trumble um seeing none next up is Mr
 
01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
after that we're going to have Christina
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
Lynch good morning
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
again uh let's address this from a
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
historical perspective the citizenship
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
question I I support the citizenship
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
requirement but you're asking the wrong
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
question in 1973 this body removed four
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
words that were in front of the words
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States and that
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
was that you were native born or you
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
were naturalized now what were they
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
talking about State citizenship from
 
01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:56.679 align:start position:0%
1808 chapter chapter 49 from 1808 all
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
the way to 1973 that's a long time folks
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
that was the requirement and I bet none
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
of you in this room know another thing
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
about federal law you know what that is
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
you can't attach any durational
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
residency requirement for someone to
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
vote in other words if you use the word
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
resident or you use the word doile you
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
can't attach a durational residency
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
requirement for that person to vote but
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
on state citizenship you can in other
 
01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
words replace the word State citizen
 
01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.350 align:start position:0%
words replace the word State citizen
with

01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
domicile and the solution would take a
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more time that I don't want
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
to occupy this committee with a limited
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
time this morning but that is the
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
solution restoring State citizenship as
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
the prerequisite in order to vote okay
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%

01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%

01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
Not hi for the record it's actually
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
chenda Lynch good morning chairman Barry
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
and committee members um I'm a resident
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
and longtime voter since 1981 in
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire also um I have
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
functioned as a deputy registar for the
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester on a couple of occas
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
occasions having gone through extensive
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
training I was on the new voter uh desk
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
there so I've handled a lot of the
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
papers that are referenced in various
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
bills that are before your committee um
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
around citizenship and so on um I'm
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
testifying on 217 partly because my
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
meter ran out at 11:30 and this was the
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
first one up but I'm opposed to any
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
number of bills that have to do with um
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots um not only in 20120
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
because of the covid pandemic um when my
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
spouse and I voted absentee being
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
conquered um but also 2022 I was
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalized during the time of the
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
actual voting and my spouse was able to
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
go to the city clerk's office get an
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot for me no questions
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
asked I filled it out they had me on the
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
voter registration since you know the
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
1980s I was able to submit it following
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
the rules double signatures this and
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
that but there was no requirement to
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
submit any other paperwork proving who I
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
was or colored pictures that's here
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere in one of the bills another
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
one is notarization another one is you
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
know ask six months ahead of time I did
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
not know I was going to fall down the
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
stairs um six months before I did and
 
02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
was hospitalized so I'm just saying that
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of these bills make no sense to me
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're more restrictive than um what is
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
required to register to vote um if
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
you're already registered to vote in the
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
city of conquer they've already had all
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
this information on you and they are at
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
least in my experience more than happy
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
to give you an absentee voter uh
 
02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
application so I want to say my
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
experience with absentee voting was
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
wonderful both during the pandemic and
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
for those of you naysayers we are likely
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
to have another one um if you listen to
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
zoonotic researchers those are the
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
animal to human transition we've got
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
that going on with bird flu right now I
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be a uh a doom and gloom
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
person but there are going to be reasons
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
that maybe many of you sitting in this
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
room will need to vote
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
absentee uh voting so I would hate to
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
see any further restrictions put on it I
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
know there have been restrictions put on
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
just registering to vote which is
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
difficult enough for people but once you
 
02:01:44.669 --> 02:01:44.679 align:start position:0%
get going to ask you ma'am to bring your
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
marks to a conclusion yes that I'm fine
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you very much will you be
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
taking questions I'd be happy too are
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
how did I fall down what happened to me
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
no I mean you you can get up and say you
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
can basically get up and say anything so
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
long as you don't impune a member you
 
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
can pretty much get for two minutes you
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
can read from Dr Seuss um next up is M
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
nsty and on Deck will be Mackenzie
 
02:02:20.159 --> 02:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
nsty and on Deck will be Mackenzie
Taylor

02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
I think this was left on it
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
red okay well thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
the committee House Bill
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
217 I oppose this very strongly this
 
02:02:44.669 --> 02:02:44.679 align:start position:0%
bill isn't necessary the bill is
 
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
questioning the Integrity of city clerks
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
Town clerks supervisors of the checklist
 
02:02:53.790 --> 02:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
they are local elected officials that
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
are sworn to uphold their job with
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
honesty they are and when application
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
when absentee applications are
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
received in town or city hall the
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
information is
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
scrutinized before it's okay to send an
 
02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:17.719 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot out so um if there's any
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
question um they do their best their
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
very best uh as serving the voters to uh
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
contact uh to uh maybe take care of that
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
question um may it be uh even due to
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
penmanship or the form isn't complete
 
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.310 align:start position:0%
penmanship or the form isn't complete
but

02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:42.679 align:start position:0%
um this uh this isn't necessary when all
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%

02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
used very very rarely in New Hampshire
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
really for folks who are unable to make
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%

Election Day um at the polls so often
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
these are folks who are either out of
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
town for an extended period or someone
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%

expanding that for these most vulnerable
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
individuals in this bill um and having
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
them also provide copies of documents

02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%

02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have would also require traveling
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
and costs to get um meaning that those
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
folks who are unable to get to the polls
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
are then also potentially
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised from registering and
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
voting absentee um that reason we are
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
opposed and I'm happy to take any
 
02:05:41.709 --> 02:05:41.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
to oppose House Bill 217 at AEL New
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we work to enure that people
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
with disabilities have equal access to
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
all aspects of Civic life including the
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to vote this bill
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
creates an undue burden for many
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
eligible voters particularly those with
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities who rely on absentee
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
registration and voting to exercise
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
their rights for many people with
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities Gathering and submitting
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
additional documentation is not a simple
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
task obtaining copies of bir
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
certificates passports or other official
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
documents often requires travel to
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
government offices payment of fees
 
02:06:54.189 --> 02:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
or access to technology for scanning and
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
printing barriers that dis
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect individuals
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
with Mobility limitations cognitive
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
disabilities low-income residents and
 
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
those who do not have access to reliable
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
transportation this bill would also
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
negatively impact voters who require
 
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
support to obtain and manage their
 
02:07:12.430 --> 02:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
personal records many individuals with
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities rely on Guardians
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
caregivers or other support networks to
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
assist them with administrative tasks
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
which can further complicate the process
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
and And Delay their ability to register
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has historically been a
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
leader in Civic pre uh participation and
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
our state has worked to improve access
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
to absentee voting for those who need it
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
most this bill Mo moves Us in the wrong
 
02:07:36.510 --> 02:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
direction rather than creating
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
additional barriers we should be working
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
to expand accessible registration and
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
voting options ensuring that all
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
eligible citizens regardless of
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
disability age or soci socionomic status
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
can fully participate in our democracy
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
for these reasons able urges you to vote
 
02:07:56.589 --> 02:07:56.599 align:start position:0%

City and town clerks
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
Association um as many of you know many
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
of our volunteers that offer to come in
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and count our uncast just received
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
ballots are just like yourselves they're
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that volunteer to run for
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
office um also many times the Town Clerk
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
and the moderator are on the bill at at
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
the on the ballot at the same time and
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
this could potentially make counting of
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
uncast ballots delayed and potentially
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
costly because we to would have to hire
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
people to count these ballots and with
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%

02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
you uh my name is Tina Gilford I'm from
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
a town clerk from the town of Derry um I
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
did hear when this bill was presented
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
that there was an amendment um so that's
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
not an amendment that I've seen um I do
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
have issue with this uh we in Derry do
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
pay our ballot clerks to come in and
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
count the blank ballots many times when
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's primary time we pair we always pair
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
them up one person from each party to
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
count and and and you know um in Derry
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
we get lots of ballots uh for example
 
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
for the presidential election I think we
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
got 20 some odd thousand um so we it
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
takes us quite a long time um but
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
because we do especially the primaries
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
by party a lot of times um myself or the
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
moderator and
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
our um our version of Selectmen our
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
counselors step in especially to make
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
the parties even so that they can count
 
02:11:20.669 --> 02:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times they're on the ballot
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
they're Counting a blank ballot with one
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
other person in public they're not
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
counting cast ballots there are no votes
 
02:11:31.229 --> 02:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
on these ballots they're literally
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
confirming the count of the ballots we
 
02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
got from the Secretary of State uh um it
 
02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
is public it is we do it publicly
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
noticed we don't do it right before the
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
polls open I know there are some towns
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
that still do that uh I'm not sure what
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
people think that we might be doing with
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
those ballots um and in a town election
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
where we have the town and the school
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
ballots um probably about 10,000 ballots
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
are being counted every six years the
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and the moderator are both on the
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
ballot at the same time um moderators
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
are every two years clerks are every
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
three years so like I said you guys have
 
02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment I haven't seen the
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
amendment maybe the amendment fixes
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
something I'm not sure uh but with that
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions other
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Wei uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
02:12:26.589 --> 02:12:26.599 align:start position:0%
the um I think I have the amendment in
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
front of me it allows uh just I won't
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing but it allows for
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
election officials as being an exception
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the counting of these blank ballots
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay um if if that were to be the
 
02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
amendment is would that be acceptable to
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
you oh yes um I definitely think that um
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
if a candidate is on the ballot uh but
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
they're not an election official and
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
they want to come and watch they're
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
welcome to
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh but we definitely wouldn't encourage
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
them um they you know but for our
 
02:12:59.470 --> 02:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
election officials especially um we have
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that volunteer and do
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
double triple Duty in town um those
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
people need to be able to actually
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
execute their job okay further questions
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pin cards in my
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.679 --> 02:13:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr chairman for um
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
accepting our late pin card and thank
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for taking our
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
brief testimony um I'm just here to
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
testify to the amended bill which we
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
just read and um received some feedback
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
on um internally so House Bill 644 as oh
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry Brody Des is a represent the
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
Amire Municipal Association thank you
 
02:13:55.549 --> 02:13:55.559 align:start position:0%
representative um House Bill uh
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
464 um as amended We Believe has
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
duplicative and unnecessary since it's
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
the the disqualification of certain
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
election officials is already addressed
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
in RSA 658 24 disqualification of
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
certain persons and RSA 659 colon 58
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
disqualification of officials and how
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
they're involved in the election the
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
vote counting process and the tabulating
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
of ballots prior to the election um we
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand the intent respect the intent
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
but we think it would create uh
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
confusion if you have these
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
disqualifications in multiple places in
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the statute for election officials um
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
and for those running the elections to
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
be able to implement and with that I'll
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions if the committee has
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
any yes I have a question so you're
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
aware this is about the precount this
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
isn't about the counting of the balls
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
this is the pre- count yes okay so those
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
statutes that you cited I don't believe
 
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
those so I I give it a reread um okay
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
other than mine not really a question
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
all right with that um there's no more
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
people sign up yes represent me youread
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
I would be uh grateful if the New
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association if it
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
has a opinion would maybe email that to
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
the committee members would love to see
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
it yeah thank you okay we can do that
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%

02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%

okay we're back going to open the public
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 288 requiring
 
03:05:35.710 --> 03:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
that absentee ballots be requested at
 
03:05:38.229 --> 03:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
least 6 months to any election for which
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot is requested I'm
 
03:05:41.309 --> 03:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
going to recognize representative wuri
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of introduction of the
 
03:05:45.710 --> 03:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
is Robert where I have the privilege of
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro District 13 the
 
03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
great town of
 
03:05:57.070 --> 03:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
Hudson House Bill 288 limits the time
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
period in which absentee ballots may be
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
requested in the November 2024 election
 
03:06:04.590 --> 03:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
a total of
 
03:06:08.910 --> 03:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
87,8 46 absentee ballots were requested
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh one aspect which is disconcerting
 
03:06:13.830 --> 03:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
about that request process is that there
 
03:06:17.309 --> 03:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
is no limitation as to when the absentee
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
ballot may be
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
requested um in the uh in the current
 
03:06:27.229 --> 03:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
statutes so consequently um there were a
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
number of bills or a number of uh
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots which were requested
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
very early in the process so for the
 
03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
November 2024 election in the third
 
03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2023 there was a total of 38
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
ballots requested absentee ballots
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
requested in the fourth quarter of 2023
 
03:06:47.950 --> 03:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
there are 314
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the first quarter of 2024 there were
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
12 uh
 
03:06:57.150 --> 03:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
1,298 and then in the uh second quarter
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
of 2024 there were um
 
03:07:03.870 --> 03:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
1,179 and then the third third quarter
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
there were 28,6 48 and then in October
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
there were a total of
 
03:07:12.670 --> 03:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
56,3 69 so that's where the total number
 
03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
of 87,8 46 absentee ballots came from
 
03:07:22.750 --> 03:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh so this bill creates a modest
 
03:07:25.110 --> 03:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
restriction which may be beneficial
 
03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
administra because you won't have to
 
03:07:29.630 --> 03:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
request you won't have to track the
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
request for as long a period of time but
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
it also just puts a uh controlled
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
variable here on the requesting of
 
03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and limits it just to
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
six months so a November election would
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
have a may cut off for the request a
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
March election would have a September of
 
03:07:51.550 --> 03:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
the previous year cut off date and I'm
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
03:07:55.840 --> 03:07:56.830 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
representative

03:07:56.830 --> 03:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
Lane hi thank you for taking my question
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
um the ACT I just wanted give you an
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explain in the where the
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
ACT is described it says that you have
 
03:08:12.190 --> 03:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
to request a ballot at least at least
 
03:08:13.469 --> 03:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
six months
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
before but the body of the text is the
 
03:08:19.389 --> 03:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
exact opposite so I just thought you
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
might want to get that on record and we
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
may need to amend it is that correct
 
03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
question that that is the joy of the um
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
OS I I think um it it was that specific
 
03:08:38.429 --> 03:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
text that you see in the Bold italics
 
03:08:38.439 --> 03:08:40.030 align:start position:0%
text that you see in the Bold italics
was

03:08:40.030 --> 03:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:08:43.469 --> 03:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
recommended um that was somehow I think
 
03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted to come up with the title of
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
the ACT
 
03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
but it it is restricting it to six
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
months before the actual
 
03:08:56.670 --> 03:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
election yes followup representative
 
03:08:59.070 --> 03:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
Lane are the ballots aren't even
 
03:09:01.870 --> 03:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
available at that point correct that is
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
correct I mean they wouldn't have the
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
candidates identified at that point and
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
but but nonetheless there are a number
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
of requests that are still submitted for
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
those further questions from the
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%

03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan same person I was this
 
03:10:13.870 --> 03:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
morning still representing straford
 
03:10:17.950 --> 03:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
County District 10 so apparently
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
um apparently only 2% of the uh absentee
 
03:10:22.990 --> 03:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
ballot application is affected by this
 
03:10:24.950 --> 03:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
but if you're one of those 2% it's a big
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
deal um since it's dis disenfranchising
 
03:10:30.990 --> 03:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
and also I'm
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
um some I'm I'm uh so I just think this
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
is a this is a I think this is an
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bill so even if it's just 2%
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the ballots uh then um then that
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's makes a big difference and also
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
of course uh this isn't really the
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors also sponsor fault but for some
 
03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
reason yeah the
 
03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the sort of like Mast head of the
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill the title of it he just raised that
 
03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
point yes I know I'm just say uh I don't
 
03:11:02.710 --> 03:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's another reason to be
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
dubious about this bill the fact that
 
03:11:06.990 --> 03:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's a the fact that there's such a
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
blatant drafting error in it so um so I
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
I Ur you this bill is unnecessary so I
 
03:11:15.550 --> 03:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose it and I oppose urge
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
you to oppose any attempts to like rest
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
the right to vote absentee if that's
 
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
what that's what works for you rather
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
than voting in person so other questions
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee I have one yeah how
 
03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
far back should someone be able to
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
request one two three four five years
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
how far back well I mean when's the cut
 
03:11:36.349 --> 03:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
off I uh I mean it probably should be
 
03:11:38.229 --> 03:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
within the election cycle I mean even
 
03:11:39.950 --> 03:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
this is so far back you might not even
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
some cases know like when the election
 
03:11:44.349 --> 03:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be and especially there's
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in here for a special election
 
03:11:49.469 --> 03:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
and those are only uh scheduled uh I
 
03:11:51.229 --> 03:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
should know scheduled two or three
 
03:11:53.950 --> 03:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
months in advance so this just so I just
 
03:11:56.110 --> 03:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on this than that'll
 
03:11:57.630 --> 03:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
be a common theme for me on this bill is
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
how far back should you be able to do it
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
all thank you uh next up is uh Dan Hy
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%

postcard application uocava voters are
 
03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
able to request absentee ballots for an
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
entire year um and so that would federal
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
law would Trump whichever um changes
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%

03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
voters uh questions from the

committee does the Secretary of States
 
03:12:43.150 --> 03:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
have a position if we carved out the
 
03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
uocava would they have a position or
 
03:12:47.229 --> 03:12:47.239 align:start position:0%

on this bill understood thank you any
 
03:12:50.349 --> 03:12:50.359 align:start position:0%

03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you now we
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
are up Mr Healey I apologize uh on Deck
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
nastasi so Dan hilly nashwa city clerk
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
the uaba um issue is something that we
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
were going that I was going to mention
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
um so I support this bill as long as
 
03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
that portion gets taken care of um I do
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
want to say that I like the six months
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
we have uh residents that drop off
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
requests in January for a November
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
election and maybe their circumstances
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
change um leading up to the election
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's a long time um to you know submit
 
03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
an application in advance and we
 
03:13:35.950 --> 03:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
actually had one resident well two
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
residents it was husband and wife that
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
requested an absentee ball in January
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the November election we had input
 
03:13:45.510 --> 03:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
it into the system they never came in to
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
update their address Within josua and
 
03:13:50.510 --> 03:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
were very upset when we mailed their
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
ballot to the the address on the
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
application that they gave us back in
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
January so you extending or allowing the
 
03:14:03.229 --> 03:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
request to go that far back you're going
 
03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
to run into issues issues like that
 
03:14:09.349 --> 03:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
where a voter um might have put their
 
03:14:12.030 --> 03:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
mailing address uh their mailing address
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
might have changed their address might
 
03:14:17.229 --> 03:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
have changed and they don't notify us
 
03:14:19.389 --> 03:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
and now they have that request on file
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
we have to send them the ballot because
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
they have that request so I think a cut
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
off time or a time that you know 6
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
months prior seems very reasonable uh
 
03:14:31.389 --> 03:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
that gives the voter enough time it
 
03:14:33.389 --> 03:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
gives us enough time to input it and get
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
it um the ballots out but you know we're
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
talking a year two years I've called the
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office before on
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
when I've received an application that
 
03:14:45.790 --> 03:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
far in advance like what do we do with
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
this and it's you you know you need to
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
enter it into the system it's just I
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
think it's too long of a time frame
 
03:14:53.429 --> 03:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
right now thank you I going need to
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
bring marks to a conclusion because I
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
got be fair everybody um any questions
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent Mirad I
 
03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
have a question um I'm a teacher
 
03:15:04.030 --> 03:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes I in some years I might teach
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
abroad for the year um I and if I were
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
to leave for a calendar year I might
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
rather go to town hall in January while
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
I'm physically present to request my
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot show my ID give them my
 
03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
address sign any relevant forms then
 
03:15:20.110 --> 03:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
then try to request it when I'm living
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
abroad um would you say that I should
 
03:15:24.830 --> 03:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to do
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't say you shouldn't be
 
03:15:28.710 --> 03:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that but when you're given
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
the situation you presented you would
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
then qualify as a uaba voter and you
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
could submit that request to us um I
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
know you said you want to do it in
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
person but the U aava voters also have
 
03:15:41.469 --> 03:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to receive their ballots
 
03:15:44.469 --> 03:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
by email and being abroad um that would
 
03:15:45.990 --> 03:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
be a quicker way to get your ballot and
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
get it back to us
 
03:15:49.710 --> 03:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
um so I know entirely answer your
 
03:15:52.510 --> 03:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
question being in person but you would
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
then fall under that specific category
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
as well further questions from the
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Mr hey
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
next up is sunasi uh on Deck is
 
03:16:04.399 --> 03:16:14.670 align:start position:0%
next up is sunasi uh on Deck is
Kaylee

03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.030 --> 03:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
estadio well uh thank you you um Mr
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Ross Berry and committee um
 
03:16:25.630 --> 03:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
I also should have uh realized about um
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
the front and back of uh M Miss uh Miss
 
03:16:31.389 --> 03:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
Nasi can you introduce yourself I know
 
03:16:33.229 --> 03:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
you've been before already today but you
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
have to it's like one of the procedural
 
03:16:36.510 --> 03:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
things I apologize for interrupting you
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take that against your
 
03:16:40.750 --> 03:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
time sasia in
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford and I I do oppose um the
 
03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
bill as this part said about at least 6
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
months prior to any
 
03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
election um I just didn't think this
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill is uh it's not realistic with
 
03:16:58.189 --> 03:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
timing of all
 
03:17:02.910 --> 03:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
involved and um and even though you may
 
03:17:06.750 --> 03:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
be um you know ahead of time um you know
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
it does cause some confusion but again
 
03:17:14.510 --> 03:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
if I flip the page and then it's

Hampshire and I too was confused by the
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
mismatch between the title of of the
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill and the content of the bill um
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
which is very confusing um and with that
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
in mind I would oppose it and ask you to
 
03:18:34.229 --> 03:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
resubmit a bill where the title is
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with the text so that there
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
is no confusion in the
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
future okay any questions from the
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%

03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%

03:19:06.910 --> 03:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.070 --> 03:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair and just for
 
03:19:11.070 --> 03:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
Kelly Penza straford District 19
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester Wards 1 2 3 4 and six um so
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
quickly um I just wanted to speak on the
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
um the opening of the bill and having
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
that mistake in there so
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
um the same thing happened with one of
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
my bills and I've already put it in an
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment so um I don't think it changes
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
at all the um the merits of the bill um
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
I know that this is an issue I've heard
 
03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
it from constituents um in straford
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
county in regards with with uh the
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
six-month lag and um there were we had
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
some people that were requesting
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots before the first in the
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
nation primary and then that would be
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
for November election so um I think that
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
we should pass this I think it's a I
 
03:20:08.590 --> 03:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill um I also um knew
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
that there was a conflict with yukaba
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
but that's already been mentioned so um
 
03:20:15.309 --> 03:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
I would love I would love this to go
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
through I've heard this from
 
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
um do Rochester and um Durham I knew
 
03:20:24.189 --> 03:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
there was an issue there too with very
 
03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
long um amounts of time in regards with
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
requesting absentees and especially if
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%

03:25:10.510 --> 03:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
um making the time frame um you know
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
specific so that the secretary shall not
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
send absentee ballot applications of the
 
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
city or town clerks prior to 45 days
 
03:25:23.189 --> 03:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
before an election um we've had issues
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
of course with um with curating ballots
 
03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
and all of that kind of stuff and it's
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
good with chain of custody keeping the
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
time closer uh so that's the reason why
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
I put this bill in okay will you be
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
taking questions from the committee sure
 
03:25:40.510 --> 03:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:42.229 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
representative

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:45.550 --> 03:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
Lane um with the previous bill that we
 
03:25:49.870 --> 03:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
just P you know voted on uh or heard
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
sorry we did vote on one but it wasn't
 
03:25:56.670 --> 03:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
the but so 288 would this really be
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
necessary yes this doesn't this um this
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with the
 
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
time frame about requesting an absentee
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
ballot these are actually when they're
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
sent from the Secretary of State oh okay
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative patina next up
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:21.309 --> 03:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
um and we are now back on our two-minute
 
03:26:22.990 --> 03:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
clocks just for those who weren't here
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
for lunch uh what I do is I allow the
 
03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
sponsors five minutes I allow the
 
03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office five minutes
 
03:26:30.910 --> 03:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
if there's need for clarification um and
 
03:26:32.110 --> 03:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent speakers are given two
 
03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
minutes which no one has ever objected
 
03:26:36.750 --> 03:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
to so I'm going to continue down that
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
path thank you very much I continue to
 
03:26:40.590 --> 03:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
be representative Timothy Horgan I
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
continue to represent straford County
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of Durham um I'm
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
not specifically with the specific issue
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
in Durham which he mentioned but we do
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
get a large number of absentee ballots
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
in in in Durham Pally partially because
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
we have like older people you know like
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
quote unquote snowbirds and like then we
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
also have lots of students in town but
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
um I think this I think this 45 day
 
03:27:07.269 --> 03:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
window I mean there probably is a need
 
03:27:10.750 --> 03:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
for some sort of window but um 45 days
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
seems like an overly short one um
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's the issue of U aava voters um
 
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
another overseas voters have to send the
 
03:27:20.110 --> 03:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
ballots overseas um you you obviously
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
need an amendment to uh to deal with
 
03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
that and so and then the last sentence
 
03:27:28.229 --> 03:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
is fine but that's pretty much already
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're already mandating something that
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
they should already be doing so I would
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
just say this bill is this bill is
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and it just uh and um it
 
03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
also cast guess further doubt on the uh
 
03:27:43.870 --> 03:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
on the validity of our elections because
 
03:27:45.790 --> 03:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
there's you know you mentioned there's
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
sort of like I think I think there's an
 
03:27:51.550 --> 03:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
I think there's like a exaggerated fear
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
of like uh bogus ballots being
 
03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
introduced into the into the uh system
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
although of course there shouldn't be
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
any at all so I would urge you I
 
03:28:02.429 --> 03:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
probably urge you not to bother with
 
03:28:03.990 --> 03:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
this bill for the reason as I said
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
before it's it's unnecessary so that's
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
so I vge you to itl it thanks thank you
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
you be taking questions from the
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee oh I'm sure are there
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
03:28:18.269 --> 03:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um next next up and I is uh
 
03:28:23.150 --> 03:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.150 --> 03:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
scalin and welcome to election law we
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
haven't seen you today so you get the
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
first welcome to election law for your
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
day okay thank you Mr chairman members
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee um David scanland
 
03:28:35.790 --> 03:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and I'm a little
 
03:28:37.550 --> 03:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
puzzled by this bill and I'm wondering
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
whether the the language is actually
 
03:28:40.110 --> 03:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:28:43.870 --> 03:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh was uh was looking for
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
because if I read the sends the
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
secretary shall not send absentee ballot
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
applications to city or town clerks
 
03:28:56.670 --> 03:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
prior to 45 days before an election the
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shall keep a record
 
03:29:01.389 --> 03:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
of the date when and the manner in which
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
applications were sent to said
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
clerks and of the number of absentee
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
ballot applications so forwarded so
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're clearly talking about absentee
 
03:29:16.349 --> 03:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
ballot applications
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
in today's world we don't print very
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
many of these we actually make them
 
03:29:23.870 --> 03:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
available online for the city and town
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
clerks to download to give to voters who
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
would like to request uh an absentee
 
03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
ballot and I'm I I'm sure those same
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
forms are email to the voter if they're
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
requested in addition to that third
 
03:29:39.790 --> 03:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
parties can also distribute absentee
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
ballot applications there is no control
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
on that and I think all of you as voters
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the state have received received the
 
03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
mailings from the political parties and
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
candidates and packs that actually have
 
03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
an application for an absente ballot on
 
03:29:57.630 --> 03:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
them you'd simply tear it off fill it
 
03:30:00.910 --> 03:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
out and send it in and then finally
 
03:30:04.429 --> 03:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
there is no requirment that a voter has
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
to fill out an absentee ballot
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
application to request one they can
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
simply write a statement to their clerk
 
03:30:14.189 --> 03:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
with that request provided the statement
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
contains all of the information that
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be on the application so
 
03:30:21.389 --> 03:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
from my perspective this would be a very
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
hard thing to control um I don't know
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
that the numbers that we would provide
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
really would mean anything and you know
 
03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm wondering if what's
 
03:30:33.150 --> 03:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
written here is actually what the
 
03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:34.510 align:start position:0%
written here is actually what the
sponsor

03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
intended be happy to answer any
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr secretary there
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee uh
 
03:30:42.479 --> 03:30:43.950 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee uh
representative

03:30:43.950 --> 03:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:46.189 --> 03:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank thank you
 
03:30:48.429 --> 03:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking the question I was
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
just wondering the 45 day time limit
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that the time when the SEC uh the
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
various clerks have to be able to send a
 
03:30:59.710 --> 03:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
u a ballot out so they would have to
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
have the application before that so I I
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
agree that this sounds unusual I guess I
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
should have asked the sponsor yeah and
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that the 45-day deadline
 
03:31:12.349 --> 03:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
applies because of a federal statute
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
related to our military and overseas
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
voters we have to send their ballots to
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
them no later than 45 days before the
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
election typically a regular absentee
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
voter starts receiving their absentee
 
03:31:29.309 --> 03:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
ballots between 45 and 30 days before
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
the election based on the when the
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%

applications um so the absentee ballot
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
applications are provided by Secretary
 
03:32:18.910 --> 03:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
of State electronically we put them on
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
our website electronically so that
 
03:32:24.030 --> 03:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
voters can download them we email them
 
03:32:25.710 --> 03:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
we also print them out so they can be
 
03:32:29.309 --> 03:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
handed out we just heard a bill uh for
 
03:32:29.319 --> 03:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
handed out we just heard a bill uh for
six

03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
six
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
months um which I can work with 6 months
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
45 days is a really short window of time
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we couldn't even start accepting
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
applications to 45 days before an
 
03:32:45.429 --> 03:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
election um we have lots of snowbirds
 
03:32:48.150 --> 03:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh a lot of them
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
right after Christmas they head south
 
03:32:52.830 --> 03:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
and one of their stops is at Town Hall
 
03:32:55.150 --> 03:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
to fill out an application for the March
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
election so that's only a couple months
 
03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of time it's about 3 months it's a
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time for they head
 
03:33:03.550 --> 03:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
south so that we can mail them their
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
ballot and a lot of them are going to
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
Florida and it can sometimes take a week
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
for the ballot to arrive down there so
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
it's great that we get the application
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
early so that as soon as the ballots are
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
in um I placed my ballot order yesterday
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh because our school district had their
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
deliberative session on Saturday so we
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
were able to place our ballot order
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday I'm really hoping that they're
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
going to turn them around real quick and
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
by next Monday I'll have ballots to
 
03:33:29.990 --> 03:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
start sending out I already have
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
requests so the 45 day timeline uh seems
 
03:33:35.389 --> 03:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
a little odd for the
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
applications um and I will be happy to
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:40.469 align:start position:0%

situation where it is not clear and
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of disinformation and

misinformation being circulated it's not

03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
some conversations I was having with uh
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
my ward Clerk and others it at the
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
election last year uh in November um we
 
03:45:04.110 --> 03:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
have our election manual I'm sure you
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
guys are familiar with this Beast of a
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
document um there are two lines in it or
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
two sections in it that I've excerpted
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
that I'll pass around uh a bits to share
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
um specifically around uh the policy
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
that we allow for absentee voting on
 
03:45:22.269 --> 03:45:22.279 align:start position:0%
Monday prior to an election if severe
 
03:45:25.229 --> 03:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
weather is forecast um this is an effort
 
03:45:28.189 --> 03:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
to keep people who otherwise would have
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
to uh travel in unsafe environment off
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
the streets if they have there's a set
 
03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
of examples that are given if Child Care
 
03:45:37.550 --> 03:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be closed and then they'd
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
have to have the kid with them um all
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things but the gist of it
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
is and something I take very seriously
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
as my role in my role as a moderator is
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that every uh cons every
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
voter has the opportunity to do so in a
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
safe Manner and the guidance we have
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
received uh from Secretary of State
 
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
scanland via Visa the election procedure
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
manual is very clear in that it says the
 
03:46:06.429 --> 03:46:06.439 align:start position:0%
best practice is to apply the broader
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
authorization in RSA 657 colon one and
 
03:46:12.070 --> 03:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
allow any voter with concerns for safety
 
03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
traveling on Election Day to vote by
 
03:46:16.030 --> 03:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
absentee on the day immediately prior to
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
the election um the current bill defines
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
three specific types of storms blizzard
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
winter weather and uh one other that is
 
03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
similar and I forget exactly what it is
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
um my the purpose of this is to change
 
03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
that to include any National Weather
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
Service warning or watch um again there
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
we have elections in September you're
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
not going to have a blizzard in
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
September but you might have a tropical
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
storm or uh other severe weather coming
 
03:46:46.870 --> 03:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the goal here again is just to make
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
sure that it is safe for people to be on
 
03:46:50.590 --> 03:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
the roads when they're doing it and if
 
03:46:52.429 --> 03:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
there is a severe weather coming in to
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
give them an opportunity to get their
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
vote in safely without having to put
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
themselves and others at risk and with
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I will be happy to take any
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee restive
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%

03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
isn't you're not advocating changing
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
this in your bill but do you think it's
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
wise at this point to reference the
 
03:47:18.389 --> 03:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
National Weather Service which I hear is
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
on its way out and perhaps substitute
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
Twitter or Breitbart or something like
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
that without getting into the X versus
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
Twitter debate thank you Mr chairman

03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
217h to House Bill
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
626 and I'm passing it out right now um
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
I did send it to the rank I gave it to
 
03:49:33.389 --> 03:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
the ranking member this morning when I
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
got it um but here it is to send down um
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to speak is there a second
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
I need a second for that representative
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
wood seconds me uh I'm going to speak to
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment so the amendment addresses
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
the concern of the Secretary of State uh
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
about basically doing a disclosure when
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
the vulnerability is still hasn't been
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
resolved um so I attempted to solve that
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
I did send the language to the Secretary
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
of States uh to the Secretary of State
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
and it uh it got a
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
resounding um it got a resounding this
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
is fine for now so
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh so uh what I did was uh basically if
 
03:50:20.349 --> 03:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
there's an issue the SEC so this in this
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
bill they reference the cyber security
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
advisory committee which is already
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 21- R16 basically the
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has to go to this
 
03:50:30.189 --> 03:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee which is already kind of
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
handling the vulnerability anyways and
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
in consultation with them they discuss a
 
03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
proper timeline um whe what is a
 
03:50:39.510 --> 03:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable timeline to fix the
 
03:50:42.030 --> 03:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and once it's fixed then
 
03:50:44.429 --> 03:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill kicks in as written
 
03:50:44.439 --> 03:50:45.469 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill kicks in as written
um

03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to take questions
 
03:50:49.389 --> 03:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or discussion on the
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
amendment but there was the you know I
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
got I got the resounding this is fine
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
for now
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
so any other questions on the amendment
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay um we can adopt amendments by a
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote um so we'll try that first
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
and see how it goes and then if not
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
we'll do a division and if not we'll do
 
03:51:09.389 --> 03:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
a roll call so uh all in favor of
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%

for a
 
03:59:26.110 --> 03:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to make a motion that we

03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
there a
 
03:59:31.710 --> 03:59:31.720 align:start position:0%

the motion to

a dispositive motion but we'll do a roll
 
03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
call anyways just to be safe but I don't
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
think it's because it's not final action
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it actually requires a
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
roll call but yes representative L you
 
03:59:54.670 --> 03:59:54.680 align:start position:0%

04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
changing um our Constitution and it's
 
04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
including terms that are not defined and
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
which have been litigated for probably
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
the past 25 years so I just don't see
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
any necess any any reason to keep this
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
going but okay is there further
 
04:01:01.149 --> 04:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion to retain on
 
04:01:01.159 --> 04:01:07.389 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion to retain on
cacr

04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
4 seeing none Madam clerk will call the
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
role which I don't think we have to do
 
04:01:13.590 --> 04:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
but we're going to do it just to be safe
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
so uh the motion is uh to retain on
 
04:01:19.510 --> 04:01:19.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
executive session for House Bill 327 FN
 
04:02:32.110 --> 04:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
relative to filing for office and
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
witnessing affidavits uh I will make the
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass is there a
 
04:02:41.950 --> 04:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
second I second that representative pram
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
O'Brien seconds that and I do have an
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment I want to move
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
um which I I think I've given to the
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
ranking member and I AP I did describe
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
it to her but I just got it that's why I
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
left earlier today so I'm going to send
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
that down and I'm going to send that
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
202-237-7000 what the amendment does is
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
it gets rid of all that language in
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
there about how many days the clerk's
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
open and how many hours they're open in
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
a two-e period it just gets rid of all
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
that and just says that people running
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
for state representative can file at
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
their Town Clerk or at the secretary of
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
state so we're going to be able to do
 
04:03:33.550 --> 04:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
just what the Senate can do and the
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
county people can do we will be able to
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
do um and the Secretary of State in his
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
testimony did not give objection to that
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
when I asked him if it was okay um and I
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a lot cleaner than a
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
certain number of days a certain number
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
of hours and trying to be in compliance
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
and then somebody suing because they
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
were open 19 hours and if that's
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
allowable I think it's just it's just a
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
lot cleaner if we're like yeah uh you
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
know Clerk or Secretary of State's
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
office so all it did was add in or the
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State at the end of the
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill at the end of the amendment so um
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
amendment oh that was was easy okay um
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
with that we can adopt amendments via
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
voice vote because it's not a a final
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
dispositive action so all in favor of
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%

delaying the reporting of election
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
results a number of polls in the state
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
are open for 14 hours Milford is one of
 
04:08:06.750 --> 04:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
those towns that have voting hours from
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. this last
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
election the last voter cast the vote
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
about 8:45 you'll see on on my testimony
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
I had 9 9:30 uh I was corrected by my
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
moderator who will be speaking that it
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
was actually around 8:45 that they
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
cleared the polls we didn't get official
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
election results till at least a couple
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
hours later if this provision had been
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
utilized it could have very easily been
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
2 am. or later before election results
 
04:08:37.000 --> 04:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
2 am. or later before election results
were

04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
announced asking volunteer resources to
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
stay at the polls until very late at
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
night or even worse into early morning
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
hours in case they are needed is a
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
burden we don't need to put on those
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
willing to freely give of their time to
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
the electoral process the main part of
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 659
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
49 to the second sentence stays intact
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is a sentence that directs the
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
moderator on the posting of the time in
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
which the processing of the absent B
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%

04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%

me as moderator in March 2008 and since
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
then I have managed 39 elections
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
including five presidential elections
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
with 10,000 registered voters I oversee
 
04:10:38.910 --> 04:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
one of the largest po single polling
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
places in the state and in the nation
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
our success is made possible possible by
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the active participation of Our Town
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
Clerk and our elected officials along
 
04:10:52.189 --> 04:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
with nearly 140 unpaid volunteers that
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
we had in
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
November RSA 659
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
492 currently permits 10 or more voters
 
04:11:01.469 --> 04:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
to postpone absentee ballot processing
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
until after the polls close for Milford
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
that in that is oneth of 1% of the
 
04:11:10.269 --> 04:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
voters could delay the processing until
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
after we have closed the polls and in
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
November as Mr Daniel spoke uh when
 
04:11:18.429 --> 04:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
numerous people registered the vote on
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
Election Day we didn't uh have the last
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
vote of cast their ballot until
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
8:45 I had conducted a test prior to the
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
November election to estimate the amount
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
of time it would take for us to process
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot based on the numbers
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
that we had received and by adding that
 
04:11:36.630 --> 04:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
data to the time I estimated it would
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
take to count count the Right End
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
ballots and hand count ballots u i
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
projected we would not finish the
 
04:11:42.920 --> 04:11:43.870 align:start position:0%
projected we would not finish the
election

04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
until after 2:00 in the morning so I ask
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
you to please bear in mind two things
 
04:11:52.590 --> 04:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
our polls open at 6:00 in the morning so
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
election officials like myself and other
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh Clerk and others arrive around 5:15
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
a.m. if we had delayed the processing of
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots our day would have
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
stretched uh to about 22 hours long and
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not as young as I used to be um we
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
were we would be exhausted and when we
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
complete the necessary paperwork for the
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
second Secretary of State and Report the
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
results to the media it would be early
 
04:12:17.119 --> 04:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
results to the media it would be early
morning

04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:12:21.309 --> 04:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
hours I I would also have to ask our
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
unpaid election officials and unpaid
 
04:12:25.870 --> 04:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers to stay overnight or arrive
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
in the early morning hours in order to
 
04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
count the rins and hand count ballots
 
04:12:33.109 --> 04:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
good luck with that so like other
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
polling places across the state the
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
processing of absentee ballots is open
 
04:12:40.670 --> 04:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
to public observation and takes place
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
successfully while the polls remain open
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%

04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%

bipartisan effort in a landscape where

04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
thousands really shouldn't have that
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
ability to completely shift the timing
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
of these absentee ballots being heard um
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
um because it can extend the time that
 
04:15:18.269 --> 04:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
those results are announced it can make
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
the moderators and all of our election
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
officials have to take long hours
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
and as the previous speaker mentioned
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
often spend overnight um finally
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
releasing that information in the early
 
04:15:32.560 --> 04:15:33.590 align:start position:0%
releasing that information in the early
morning

04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
hours so um it is for these reasons that
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to vote a to pass on to
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
994 will we be taking questions sure are
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you next up is
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
Kip thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jonathan Kip I'm
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
the town moderator in the town of
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
londonairy and and I will Echo what the
 
04:16:17.870 --> 04:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
two previous speakers said uh Londoner
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
is a little larger than Milford we have
 
04:16:20.040 --> 04:16:21.790 align:start position:0%
is a little larger than Milford we have
18,000

04:16:21.790 --> 04:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
18,000
 
04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
757 voters currently and uh to the prior
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
speaker's Point that's 500s of 1% of our
 
04:16:32.349 --> 04:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
voters who have the opportunity to
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
completely disrupt our election
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
processes on Election Day with no
 
04:16:39.109 --> 04:16:39.119 align:start position:0%
warning these 10 people can arrive one
 
04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
minute before we're scheduled to process
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and delay it until
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
after the polls close which leads to
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
Greater opportunities for errors because
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the time we would spend long into the
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the we hours of the morning um and I
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
find it interesting that 500s of 1% of
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
our voters could uh could could make
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
such a change to our process when on any
 
04:17:06.429 --> 04:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
ballot measure it takes 50% if not a
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
super majority it just seems like such a
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
small group of people who could make
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
such a major change
 
04:17:16.030 --> 04:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh so my two big reasons are a prone to
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
errors if this is allowed to remain in
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
the law and second the disruption that
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
it causes among the election teams that
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
have spent weeks planning the election
 
04:17:27.990 --> 04:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling the workers having shifts
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
assigned and then at the last minute
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
that go all gets thrown into disarray so
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for consideration and I
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
bill are there questions from the we be
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%

04:17:42.269 --> 04:17:42.279 align:start position:0%

are you aware of the incidents that
 
04:17:51.870 --> 04:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
happened in Durham and I think Windham
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
last election I've heard about them yes
 
04:17:57.309 --> 04:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have direct knowledge thank you

you further questions from the committee
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I accidentally shut your mic off
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
because I pressed the wrong button so if
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
somebody does ask you have to turn it
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
back on I'm the only one who gets that
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
ability I can shut off everybody's mic
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it's right next to my button so I
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
mispress it all the time anyway all
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
right uh not seeing not seeing any more
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Kip next up is

Nelson I'm the dairy Town moderator I

would like to Echo and endorse the
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
comments of my fellow moderators who
 
04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
have um given their testimony
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
um all of the reasons they have given
 
04:18:49.469 --> 04:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
are very good um I don't see any great
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
Improvement in the
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
transparency of processing absentee
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
ballots if it's done later at night um
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
it is done in an area that's publicly
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
visible there's an area specifically set
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
up for folks to uh witness um all of
 
04:19:05.109 --> 04:19:05.119 align:start position:0%
those um
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
activities um during the most recent
 
04:19:10.830 --> 04:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
presidential election um we started
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
processing absentee ballots um at 9:00
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the morning which was the earliest
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
time we were permitted based on when the
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
polls opened um and we did not actually
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
complete processing the absente ballots
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
until about 8:45 is um when the polls
 
04:19:28.990 --> 04:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
nomally Clos at 8 um we were still
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
processing absentee ballots after the
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
last in-person voter
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
voted um with all of that we were there
 
04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
till 3: in the morning counting all the
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
hand counts and rins there were a large
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
number of rins
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
um and these are these are paid um bull
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
workers but people um get tired and when
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
you get tired you tend to make more
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
mistakes and so if we had to do all of
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
that absentee ballot processing in
 
04:20:00.910 --> 04:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
between um closing the polls and
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
beginning um the hand and and right in
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
count we probably would have been there
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
at 7:00 the next morning um as it was it
 
04:20:11.710 --> 04:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
was a 24-hour long day for me so I would
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
um strongly encourage
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
enage um the committee to um approve
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
this bill I support it um and as to the
 
04:20:21.790 --> 04:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
practicality um to my knowledge there
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
has never been um a successful petition
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
in der to delay um processing of of
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
absentee violence but I am aware of at
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
least one or two attempts that fell
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
short of the required number of
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
signatures I happy to take questions are
 
04:20:39.109 --> 04:20:39.119 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee seeing
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
none thank you uh next up is Dan Healey
 
04:20:47.149 --> 04:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
Shard good afternoon Dan hilly nashwa
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
City Clerk and I'm speaking behalf of
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
Association uh we do support this bill
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
um in nashwa um I have my moderators
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
post the processing of the absentees two
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
hours after the polls open I think this
 
04:21:09.070 --> 04:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
is a good practice to give them as much
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
time as possible throughout today to
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
complete uh that process especially the
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
last election the general election it
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
was very busy during the day um they
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
would start the process they'd be pulled
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
in a few different directions and
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
waiting until the close of polls just
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
delays the results uh the history on
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
this it was not um as far as I know I
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't recall it being um ever
 
04:21:35.229 --> 04:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
implemented ever used until the past few
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
years where one specific Community has
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
been kind of targeted multiple elections
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
in a row in you know I've asked some
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
questions I've asked you know what what
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
is the reasoning for processing the
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
absentees the delay and the you know the
 
04:21:54.670 --> 04:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
10 individuals that have been
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
repetitively doing this I haven't heard
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
of a a good reason to process the to
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
delay the processing the absentees until
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
after the close of polls um so I'm not
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
really quite sure what the argument is
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
on the other side of why you would want
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
to delay um I think up until a few years
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
was very uh it wasn't well known that it
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
was even in the RSA um last year there
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
was a pre-processing bill in part of
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
that um was removing this language and
 
04:22:26.910 --> 04:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
um that got ited but this has been on
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
our association's radar um we don't
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
really see the need to delay the
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
processing of absentees especially by a
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
such a low threshold 10 voters uh most
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
of my well all of my Awards they have
 
04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
the I think the lowest I think is 4,000
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
we go up to 7,000 voters just 10 showing
 
04:22:50.349 --> 04:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
up is is a very very low threshold to um
 
04:22:53.710 --> 04:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
make a significant impact on the uh on
 
04:22:56.349 --> 04:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
the processing and the results for the
 
04:22:58.109 --> 04:22:58.119 align:start position:0%
day have you open any
 
04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
questions you nailed your time you're
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
the second person to get hit the zeros
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
um questions from the
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and last
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
up is Sarah shinard I'm I'm I'm probably
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
butchering butchering it so
 
04:23:15.790 --> 04:23:15.800 align:start position:0%

04:23:17.670 --> 04:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
day to show you how sad my life is
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes hello everybody my name is
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
Sarah shanard and I am the voting rights
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
program manager with the New Hampshire
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights which is a
 
04:23:28.590 --> 04:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
project of America votes and the New
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights um
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
helped convene and organize an election
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
Protection Program for the primary and
 
04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
general elections last year and one of
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard most concerned
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
about from our election officials was
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
the attempts to move abs ballot
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
processing to the end of the day and the
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
impact that that would have on when
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
results would actually be ready absentee
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
ballot processing is public noticed and
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing that happens when you
 
04:23:56.189 --> 04:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
delay it is to the end of the night is
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
the entire process is longer it's more
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
straining on our poll workers and our
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
election officials and the results come
 
04:24:06.870 --> 04:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
in much much later that's it will you be
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
taking questions from the committee sure
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
04:24:12.109 --> 04:24:12.119 align:start position:0%

up in support who did not speak and then
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
294 online was 411 support 65 opposed
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%

Amendment yes um the amendment addresses
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
some of the comments that were made
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
particularly by the Secretary of State's
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
office to make the um uh terms receipts
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
or expenditures consistent with what we
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
changed last year in the um campaign
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
Finance Reform Bill that we did so the
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
the change is to attest to the receipts
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
and expenditures and just to have it one
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
box that would be checked off further
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment uh I'm going
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be voting for the amendment uh last
 
04:26:53.469 --> 04:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
term we had a very even though we were
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
split 1010 we had a very good agreement
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
that we allowed amendments to bills um
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
that were not you couldn't couldn't take
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
a bill and completely rework it but if
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
we allowed people to fix their bills in
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
in a show of good faith um so while I I
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
I think may have issues with the
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
underlying bill I am going to vote for
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment um because I think that I
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
would like to keep that tradition going
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
I I see no reason to end it um so with
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
that uh we can adopt amendments uh by
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
Voice vote um so uh representative Lane
 
04:27:26.830 --> 04:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
has moved Amendment
 
04:27:26.840 --> 04:27:32.550 align:start position:0%

04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of inex
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
speeding to
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislate representative Lane
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
um I've yet to hear a reason against the
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill that's been voiced and maybe I
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
missed it I haven't been on my game as
 
04:29:52.030 --> 04:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
much as I usually am today but I would I
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
would like to hear why people are
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
against this bill that would make it
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
transp it's making things transparent
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
and all you're having to do is check a
 
04:30:06.109 --> 04:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
box would any member like to answer
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's questions I would
 
04:30:09.070 --> 04:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
like to address her question
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
I I believe that the law as presently
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
constituted is completely transparent
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
therefore I believe that this bill is uh
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
redundant and unnecessary now
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
6647 uh RSA 6647 registering and
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
Reporting by candidates has two
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions first it says prior to filing
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
any campaign Finance statements a
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
candidate shall register with the
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State through the online
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
camp campaign Finance
 
04:30:42.920 --> 04:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
camp campaign Finance
[Music]

04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
system the second provision is that
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
additionally any candidate who has
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
receipts or expend is exceeding 1,000 in
 
04:30:55.229 --> 04:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
an election cycle shall file
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
statements that implies quite clearly
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
unambiguously and transparently that
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
anyone who has receipts or expenditures
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
over a thousand or less is not required
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
to uh file a campaign Finance report and
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
this is not an oversight in fact up
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
until I think it was 2021 someone
 
04:31:18.149 --> 04:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm misremembering but the
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
threshold you had to exceed to file be
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
required to file a report was $500 we
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
raised it to a th000 at that time with
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
no discussion about the basic concept
 
04:31:32.469 --> 04:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
now the reason I say this is perfectly
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
transparent as currently uh as as the
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
RSA currently reads is the only reason
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
that one can legally not file campaign
 
04:31:45.870 --> 04:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
Finance system report is
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
their expenditures or receipts did not
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
exceed a th000 so therefore if a
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
candidate does not file a report the
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
clear implication is that they did not
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
exceed that
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
threshold I think that's very
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
unambiguous if someone has a candidate
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
they wish to check out there's no
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
report they should assume that they were
 
04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
following the law we are a society where
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
we believe in innocent until proven
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
guilty they should assume that the
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
candidate followed the law unless they
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
have evidence otherwise in which case
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
they should pursue a
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
complaint so the bill is redundant it's
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
therefore unnecessary and it therefore
 
04:32:32.189 --> 04:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
imposes an unnecessary administrative
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
burden upon many candidates for public
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
office I'm most familiar with um
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
representatives of the New Hampshire
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
house we heard a statistic from the uh
 
04:32:45.550 --> 04:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
witness for the bill at the public
 
04:32:47.550 --> 04:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't remember the exact
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
number but it was in effect about 800 U
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me candidates for the New
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house and over 400 did not uh
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
submit a campaign Finance system report
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
in some recent election therefore we
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
would be imposing this unnecessary
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
burden on over 400
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
candidates I see that as and that would
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
be with no additional benefit to the
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
public so those are my reasons for
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
recommending in expedient to legislate
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
on this Bill thank you for your time
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
forther discussion on the bill
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I'll just say that
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
when we heard this bill last year there
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
were some uh comments made that uh
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
people had in fact uh spent more than a
 
04:33:38.269 --> 04:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
thousand and there's no way to have them
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
affirm that they in fact did not spend
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
so there's no information those of us
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
who have to
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
file those of us who have to file um we
 
04:33:51.629 --> 04:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
have to affirm and representative quy
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
and I I guess respectfully will just
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
disagree on whether or not this is an
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden and whether it's
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
clear so thank you okay um is there any
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill as
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
amended I just want to say that I agree
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
with representative Lane that we
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
awesome um all right with that we are on

public hearing uh I'm going to open the
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
notice public hearing for house B 686 FN
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
requiring a voter to approve

identification requesting an absentee
 
04:35:48.189 --> 04:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
ballot and I'm going to recognize
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative Penza for the purpose of
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
bill representative Penza didn't think
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be able to stay on time today I just
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
want to point that out and and here we
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
are wow you like I said you're a
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
rockstar at moving this along my hearing
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
which is going to probably be going on
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
right now that I have to introduce
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
another bill so I'm going to be as quick
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
as possible for the record uh
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly pend us Stafford
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
District 19 um this bill has been needed
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
for a long time um we haven't been
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
following uh we haven't been following
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
our constitution for one thing but in
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
the meantime we need to get something
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
done we have
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
unqualified and um unqualified and
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
unchecked absentee voters that's going
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
on um our our clerk in our town excuse
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
me City Clerk in Rochester um basically
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
told me that she cannot ask for ID for
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
someone it is uh she was actually um a
 
04:36:48.910 --> 04:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
few years ago was um landbased because
 
04:36:50.910 --> 04:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
someone came in that was a clerk or
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
worked in the clerk's office at another
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
city and uh told her that you can't do
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
that so this changes that um and it
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
changes of course people that are
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
requesting uh an absentee ballot as well
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
um so right now in the city if you go in
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
to request an absentee ballot you do not
 
04:37:13.709 --> 04:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
have to to show an ID if you do which
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
most people do um they'll take it and
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
write it down but they can't ask for it
 
04:37:19.840 --> 04:37:21.470 align:start position:0%
write it down but they can't ask for it
um

04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
so and then you let's say you take it
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
home you do whatever you need to do and
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
then you bring it back you also don't
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to show an ID to bring it back
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
unless you're someone that's dropping it
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
off for them so the person that's
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
dropping it off that isn't actually the
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
voter um has to show an ID it's it's in
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
pure Insanity um the other piece is um
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
basically if you're calling you know
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're calling for an absentee ballot or
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
you send in an absente ballot
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
application and you're calling for it to
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
have one sent to you um that in filling
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
out that application that you're not
 
04:38:02.551 --> 04:38:02.561 align:start position:0%
required to show an ID as well um you
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
should be just like anything else um you
 
04:38:08.109 --> 04:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
should have your ID it it should be a a
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
real affidavit um not just signing a
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
piece of paper anybody could sign that
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
and excuse me we need um we need it
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
notorized so that's what this bill does
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
it makes um uh basically unqualified
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for mail and ballots um
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
legit and we need this for another
 
04:38:35.551 --> 04:38:35.561 align:start position:0%
reason as well we're creating we what
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
we've created in the state of New
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is two class system so if I go
 
04:38:41.629 --> 04:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
in person and I vote I have to to show
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
an ID to vote we have that and it's a
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
law but if I request a um an absentee
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
ballot I don't we created two classes of
 
04:38:53.230 --> 04:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
Voters and that's illegal as well so
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
this bill fixes that and that's pretty
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
much um all I have to say about that
 
04:38:59.709 --> 04:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee sure are there questions from
 
04:39:03.990 --> 04:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
the committee repres new thank you for
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%

04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
not trying to like mock you he literally
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
I can't see him so than than you Mr
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:15.070 --> 04:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
question uh voting in person do you need
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
anything notorized when you go in to
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
vote in
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
person uh no unless thank you very
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
much the member make answer the
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
question okay so are you're saying like
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
if you come in with an ID no you
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to notorized that would
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
you like a follow person new some and
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
please and and I I please accept my
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
apology for cutting you off I do
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for that that's fine um your
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
complaint with the ID versus was an
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
illegal two class system wouldn't the
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
requirement for notarization create that
 
04:39:48.910 --> 04:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
just in the opposite direction how that
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
how are you going to prove if it's if a
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
a ballot is coming by mail that someone
 
04:39:55.390 --> 04:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
showed an ID that's what the that's what
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
the notary would be is someone check
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
that ID they said who they were before
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
you sent in your
 
04:40:04.590 --> 04:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
ballot further questions from the
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
Lane are you aware that you're signing
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
an affidavit that if your to fraudulent
 
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
sign it you're under voter fraud laws
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
currently it's up to $5,000 and a
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I'm I'm quite aware of that
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
but an affidavit is not an affidavit if
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
it's not verified by by someone that um
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
is in a sense showing an ID and all you
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
an affidavit means nothing if you're
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
just signing a piece of paper and it
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't get followed up on we have we
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
have thousands and thousands of of sworn
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
affidavits that don't get followed up on
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
at all in the state further questions
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative C uh thank you
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:40:49.680 --> 04:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
um is it possible then that if later on
 
04:40:59.070 --> 04:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
we require that uh the absentee balance
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
be notorized that then then a person
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh getting two
 
04:41:03.920 --> 04:41:08.750 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh getting two
different

04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
notorized ballot would have to be
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
notorized it would be just in requesting
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
it you are just when you're when you go
 
04:41:19.470 --> 04:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
in person you give your ID they check
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
you off they make sure everything's good
 
04:41:23.670 --> 04:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
to go address is all lined up and you're
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
handed a ballot we should be doing the
 
04:41:28.590 --> 04:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
same way it's the same exact process but
 
04:41:30.990 --> 04:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be done
 
04:41:31.000 --> 04:41:32.830 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be done
via

04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
via
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
absentee further questions from the
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane have there
 
04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
been any recorded instances of fraud in
 
04:41:46.110 --> 04:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.868 --> 04:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
problem um recorded incidences there's
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
been I don't know if you recorded
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
incidents as as uh um yes I'm going to
 
04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
say yes I'm going to say yes on on all
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
of that and and things have been brought
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
to um the AG's attention things haven't
 
04:42:04.868 --> 04:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
been followed through there's going to
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
be some testimony behind me that will um
 
04:42:10.990 --> 04:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully um tell you about that as well
 
04:42:15.310 --> 04:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
um we did so for example uh in the 2020
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
election uh I lived in Rye and so these
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
are my firstand examples uh we had we
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
had over a 100% voter turnout that's
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
statistically impossible when they most
 
04:42:29.830 --> 04:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they've ever had was in the 60s so
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
we did canvasing
 
04:42:34.590 --> 04:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
afterwards and the the voter roles were
 
04:42:36.910 --> 04:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
manipulated people were sent ballots
 
04:42:38.830 --> 04:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't even live at those homes as
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
you can imagine in Rye um some of those
 
04:42:43.628 --> 04:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
people are just renting them out of
 
04:42:46.110 --> 04:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
course for whether the summer or winter
 
04:42:50.110 --> 04:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
rental so we canvased afterwards and I
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
knocked on doors and I asked to speak to
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Mrs Smith who lived there that voted
 
04:42:57.628 --> 04:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
in that election they didn't live there
 
04:42:59.310 --> 04:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
and they hadn't lived there for three or
 
04:42:59.320 --> 04:43:00.230 align:start position:0%
and they hadn't lived there for three or
four

04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
years that happened more than a dozen
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
times so yes I have firsthand knowledge
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
committee representative Wei we we tend
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
to we alternate we just had a Democrat
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
ask now we're a republican ask then
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative William you can be up and
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
we can all have our
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
turn uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so the the issue
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
as you see it is at the polling place
 
04:43:28.750 --> 04:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
you have identity verification going on
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
by the election officials right then
 
04:43:33.550 --> 04:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
when the absentee ballot is sent in
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
there is no identity verification at
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
that point and so you're proposing that
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
the notary republic or or some
 
04:43:42.750 --> 04:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
notarizing entity would verify the
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
identity and that's what you're seeking
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here right correct thank
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
you further questions from commit
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative Willams
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you chairman
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
representative thanks for taking my
 
04:43:55.708 --> 04:43:55.718 align:start position:0%
question is there a reason that the
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
color photo copy needs to
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:11.200 --> 04:44:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
okay no I mean that was so I told OS
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
exactly what I needed and they that was
 
04:44:33.550 --> 04:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
written in by them that was not
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
specified by me I can kind of understand
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
I guess um why um it's a color copy of a
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
valid govern government issued photo
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
identification with this form to receive
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot um if the applicant
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
does not include a color copy uh the
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
applicant's ballot would be rejected um
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably has something to
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
do with it's easier to
 
04:44:59.230 --> 04:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
um to have a or to manipulate an ID if
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
it's in black and white versus it being
 
04:45:02.910 --> 04:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
in color so that must be the reason why
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
that was put there I didn't I didn't
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
write that language the attorney did an
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
OSS but if that's a problem we can look
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
at that I
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
I I I glassed over that whole thing my
 
04:45:16.830 --> 04:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
whole point was just we need to have
 
04:45:19.868 --> 04:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
people show an ID in person when they go
 
04:45:22.590 --> 04:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
to a clerk's office to request their ID
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
to request their ballot as well as when
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
it is mailed in or dropped off further
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee representa
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
C you'll be next but representative girl
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
has not asked a question yet so so you
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
guys know when there's a lot of
 
04:45:37.470 --> 04:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
basically what I do is I try to
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
alternate party and if I can't do that
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
but who if somebody has not asked a
 
04:45:44.270 --> 04:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
question first they will always go to
 
04:45:45.788 --> 04:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
the front of the line so new people
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
speaking will always be in front but I
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
try to alternate so we'll go to
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative Grill because she has not
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
spoken yet thank you um there's a lot of
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
identity verification technology that's
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
currently in use you know for example
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
for online baking there has to be some
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
sort of system when you scan in a a
 
04:46:03.990 --> 04:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
check um certain Healthcare Services
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
have ID scanners what it might
 
04:46:09.788 --> 04:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
streamline things perhaps might not be
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
the most coste efficient but maybe with
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
people requesting ballots online more
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
and more often would an online
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
verification system might be a more
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
streamlined and um you know some some
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
sort of either scanner or um or way of
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
matching that to the data that's on file
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
um with the ID would that be a more
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
streamlined and better in the long-term
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
solution especially with a lot of people
 
04:46:35.788 --> 04:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
who uh you know might not have a
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
photocopy or a lot of people are going
 
04:46:38.910 --> 04:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
digital I hear your um I hear your
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
concern and um I am you know a
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
hand-counted paper ballots kind of gal
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say no on that because I
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
believe that we were able to do it for
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
um you know over a hundred years and I
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
think we could do that again I'm not for
 
04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
like an online portal um just because I
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
think that that opens us up for other
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
problems um in my in my um not every
 
04:47:08.910 --> 04:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
city has this but in our city we have
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
pole pads and um and so basically you
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
can give them your license and it scans
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
it right in and it pulls up um those are
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a a closed system um so
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know if that is the will of the
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
people then for something like that I'd
 
04:47:29.548 --> 04:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
be okay with it but for right now it's
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe that that is going
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
to be something that we're going to be
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
able to push forward so in the meantime
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
um we should be able to do this the good
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
thing is is that if you're going in
 
04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
person or you are going to pick up a
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
ballot for someone that is disabled when
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
you show your ID um so for example at
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
the city clerk's office that's all
 
04:47:53.548 --> 04:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
written down and noted and they have
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
that option as well they have that
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
option to get notorized right then and
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
there they could bring in the person's
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
ID with them like that whole piece can
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
can already happen so for example there
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
was a woman she was in her car um her
 
04:48:12.910 --> 04:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
daughter um brought in her ID um she
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
waved at her from the car I mean it was
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know it we're not trying to um we're
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to make it more
 
04:48:22.990 --> 04:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
difficult we need to have the same
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
process everybody should be on the same
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
playing field whether you're a mailin
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
vote absentee Vote or if you're voting
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
in person we should all be showing our
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
ID just like we need to do for
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
I was just uh thank you Mr chairman

thank you representative for taking my
 
04:48:49.390 --> 04:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
question uh if somebody's got to get
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
this application notorized do they need
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
to show their actual ID to the notary
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
and not have to send in a copy of the U
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
of their ID
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%

is Linda Bundy and I'm from antrum I
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
oppose hb6 86 requiring a voter to
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
provide identification when requesting
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot at the present time
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot applications must be
 
04:49:52.510 --> 04:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
signed by the voter and anyone who
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
assists them with completing the
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
application this bill requires
 
04:49:59.230 --> 04:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
authorization of the application as well
 
04:50:01.868 --> 04:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
as inclusion of a color copy of a valid
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
governmen issued photo ID these steps
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
would be inconvenient for any voter who
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
is eligible to vote absentee but for
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
senior citizens and people with
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities they are a significant
 
04:50:14.718 --> 04:50:15.750 align:start position:0%
disabilities they are a significant
undue

04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
undue
 
04:50:18.670 --> 04:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
burden there is also a monetary cost for
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
these requirements which would be borne
 
04:50:24.190 --> 04:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
by the voter eligible voters may decide
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
that it is simply not worth their time
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
energy and money to vote absentee voting
 
04:50:33.868 --> 04:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is secure and safe HB
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%

04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
deter them I'd like to address the
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
notorized in this bill and the Very
 
04:51:36.270 --> 04:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
people who might want to vote absentee
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
such as those with health and disability
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
issues uh being out of town um being at
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
home caring for someone who can't be
 
04:51:49.150 --> 04:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
left alone those are the very people for
 
04:51:53.670 --> 04:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
whom getting to a a notary would be
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
difficult I was talking with a League of
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
Women Voters member from the North
 
04:52:00.990 --> 04:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
country and so I looked up notaries
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
online for her town and the nearby
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
larger town and nothing came up there's
 
04:52:11.708 --> 04:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
a a website called National notary.org
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
that supposedly lists them now we know
 
04:52:17.548 --> 04:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
that some banks have notaries but not
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
all their hours that are open we know
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
that some post offices but not all serve
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
as notaries some Town clerks do but for
 
04:52:28.670 --> 04:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
some of these people who have a
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to try to get an
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot getting to those
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
notaries during The Limited times when
 
04:52:37.548 --> 04:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
they're available could be a real
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire according again
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
to a website about notaries it's
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
permissible to charge from10 to
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
$25 for notary services I know that some
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
sources Do It free my town clerk did in
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
my former town of
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
Newbury uh but that doesn't mean all of
 
04:53:00.990 --> 04:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
them would do it for free in fact just
 
04:53:03.470 --> 04:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
the opposite some would
 
04:53:07.708 --> 04:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
charge so in both this bill and 608 that
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
require notorized
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
and IDs you're essentially creating a
 
04:53:17.948 --> 04:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
pole tax for some people who have a
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason for getting an
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you we be taking questions
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee Miss tanelli no okay
 
04:53:31.600 --> 04:53:34.868 align:start position:0%
from the committee Miss tanelli no okay
thank

04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
one I know my handwriting probably
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
situation push the button um for the
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is Autumn rashik Goodwin
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
the program coordinator for open
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
democracy and I live in Manchester New
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm testifying in opposition
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
to hb6 86 um as was pointed out by the
 
04:54:19.030 --> 04:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
speakers before me many voters decide to
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
vote absentee ballots due to physical
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
limitations due to being out of town and
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
this makes getting something notorized
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult and creates a
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
barrier for them casting their
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
ballots they may not have the reliable
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
transportation they may not have a
 
04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
notary in their Town
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
um additionally there's a cost involved
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to getting something
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
notorized in many cases um according to
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
the National notary Association on
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
average it costs $10 in New Hampshire to
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
get some a form notorized
 
04:54:57.628 --> 04:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't address that and
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
how that would be paid would that be
 
04:55:02.190 --> 04:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
waved by the state would the individual
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
have to cover that would that then be a
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
pole tax um it between the burden that
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
this creates and the potential cost
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
ramifications it
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
really has the potential to
 
04:55:20.110 --> 04:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise voters particularly ones
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
living on fixed incomes who don't have
 
04:55:26.110 --> 04:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
the budget wiggle room to pay this sort
 
04:55:26.120 --> 04:55:29.708 align:start position:0%
the budget wiggle room to pay this sort
of

04:55:29.708 --> 04:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
notorized to vote itl on HB
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%

committee not seeing anything any thank

04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am here today to strongly
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 686 HB 686 erects unnecessary
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
and discriminatory barriers to absentee
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
voting by mandating that voters submit a
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
color copy of a governmen issued photo
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
ID with their application and requiring
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
not notarization of absentee ballot
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
applications these Provisions impose
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
undue burdens on voters with
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities older ad adults and others
 
04:56:52.548 --> 04:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
who rely on absentee voting as a
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental means of civic
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
participation requiring voters to submit
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
a color copy of their in identification
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
creates significant accessibility and
 
04:57:04.350 --> 04:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
financial barriers many individuals with
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities lack uh reliable
 
04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
transportation making it difficult to
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
access Loc s where they can make color
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
copies the financial burden of printing
 
04:57:16.270 --> 04:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
or copying documents in color further
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
compounds this issue particularly those
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
for those on fixed
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
incomes additionally not all individuals
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
have access to the Necessary Technology
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
to scan and print a color copy at home
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
further disenfranchising voters who
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
already face systematic barriers
 
04:57:35.470 --> 04:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
mandating notarization of absentee
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
ballot applications introduces yet
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
another hurdle for voters with Mobility
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
impairments those in rural areas and
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
individuals in congregate care settings
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
accessing a notary can be a logistical
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
and financial challenge while some
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
states have implemented virtual
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
notarizations New Hampshire has not made
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
this option widely available for
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
absentee voting leaving many without a
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
feasible means to comply with this
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
requirement the additional burden of
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
finding traveling to and in some case
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
paying for a notary creates an undue
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
barrier that disproportionately impacts
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
disabled V voters New Hampshire has a
 
04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
long history of upholding the
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to vote including for
 
04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
those who cannot vote in person due to
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
disability HB 686 undermines this
 
04:58:22.470 --> 04:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
principle by making absentee voting an
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
already essential accessibility measure
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
excessively difficult to navigate these
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
requirements will have a
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on individuals

up today but wanted to start off by
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
reminding folks that like other
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
affidavits affidavits on absentee ballot
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
forms are signed under penalty of
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
perjury with serious consequences um
 
04:59:41.470 --> 04:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
many folks as talked about vote absentee
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know for a lot of different reasons
 
04:59:44.830 --> 04:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
but a large group of them are uh folks
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
with disabilities including seniors um
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
and under this legislation not only
 
04:59:51.470 --> 04:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
those folks have to go through the
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
multi-step process of requesting an
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and then getting it or
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
also adding in having a color or black
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
and white printer um and scanner to have
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
that copy of their ID and finding a
 
05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
notary um earlier it was mentioned that
 
05:00:07.110 --> 05:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
folks could maybe go in you know bring
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
the the application in with a with the
 
05:00:11.948 --> 05:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
IDE or a copy of the ID whoever the
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation requires that the applicant
 
05:00:16.830 --> 05:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
signature is notorized so it's not just
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
having the ID brought in or having
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
someone who's dropping it off notorized
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
the person who is applying for the
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot who potentially cannot
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
leave their home cannot travel that
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
person has to have the notorized
 
05:00:31.110 --> 05:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
signature um and as I was reading this
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
bill and thinking about my testimony I
 
05:00:34.990 --> 05:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
really thought about my grandmother who
 
05:00:37.270 --> 05:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh voting meant a lot to her she worked
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
at the polls in marac year after year
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
would talk to all about it would talk
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
about volunteering on political
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
campaigns calling voters in the French
 
05:00:46.670 --> 05:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
side on the west side of Manchester and
 
05:00:48.788 --> 05:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
speaking French to them uh and she loved
 
05:00:50.548 --> 05:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
voting but as she got older and she lost
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
her sight um and wasn't able to stand in
 
05:00:54.910 --> 05:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
line and vote as easily wasn't able to
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
work at the polls um she started voting
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
absentee and my dad would help her that
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
with that um and even though she was
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone who had voted her whole life and
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
it meant so much to her she often felt
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
like it was really a burden to have
 
05:01:08.590 --> 05:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
assistance with getting the application
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
sending it in filling out her ballot
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
having someone help with that having
 
05:01:14.110 --> 05:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
them deliver it um and thinking through
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
this adding these extra requirements
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
maybe having a notary come to her home
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
or going to the bank um you know having
 
05:01:23.390 --> 05:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
someone having someone have to make a
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
photocopy of her ID I am fearful of you
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
know what that would mean to her in
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
terms of additionally feeling like
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
voting was a burden and maybe sitting
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
out for that reason and I hope that that
 
05:01:34.310 --> 05:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
does not happen to other voters in the
 
05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
same way um so thank you so much and I'm
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you other
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is Mr Richard Mr I
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
apologize your your car got uh lost in
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom you should have gone earlier
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
apologize all right thank you for your
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
time members of the committee chairman
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
um on this affidavit issue first and
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
foremost I just submitted to all of you
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
a copy of the
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
overvote uh when people claim that there
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
is no disenfranchised or vote delution
 
05:02:15.548 --> 05:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
they're not telling the truth and here's
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
why first of all I'm in front of the
 
05:02:18.990 --> 05:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
state supreme court on this very issue
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court has found I have
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
standing on this issue which is everyone
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
must be treated the same now the
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit requirement is a matter of Law
 
05:02:33.310 --> 05:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
and it has usage and custom in 1942 when
 
05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
the state legislature saw fit to write
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
the statutes to establish absentee
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
voting in the process they put in in the
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
affidavit requirement which is statute
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
which I testified to earlier
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
65950 colon B the moderator of every
 
05:02:50.548 --> 05:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
town is required to examine that
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
envelope and make sure that the
 
05:02:54.910 --> 05:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit was properly executed that
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
definition in law has been established
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
by this body so you have first the
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
courts of law every Court in this state
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
in order to submit evidence into a court
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
of law has to have a sworn affidavit
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
before an official authorized by law to
 
05:03:10.670 --> 05:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
administer an oath the legislature has
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
seen fit that there are 262 places where
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
a stat where an affidavit must be
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
executed the the word and the usage is
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
well known it's 500 years old we can't
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
redefine the word affidavit for
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
convenience sake if we're going to amend
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
the process then amend the process but
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm pointing out to you is that we
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
have a disparity in the equal
 
05:03:34.990 --> 05:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
application of the law which is everyone
 
05:03:36.910 --> 05:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
in the state has to produce an ID in
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
order to vote if you apply for a mailin
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
vote and go to your local municipality
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to check it for you and
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to take your ballot again
 
05:03:47.948 --> 05:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
the problem isn't uh the problem isn't
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
whether I'm for or against it I'm simply
 
05:03:51.628 --> 05:03:51.638 align:start position:0%
pointing out that we have laws on the
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
books that are binding and more
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
importantly this committee last year
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 1569 there is no
 
05:04:02.110 --> 05:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
excuse voter ID everyone who votes must
 
05:04:04.510 --> 05:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
produce an
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
ID thank you Mr Richard questions um
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you last up
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Dan Healey nashwa
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
city clerk um I am opposed to this bill
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh for the same reasons as a lot of the
 
05:04:28.750 --> 05:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
previous speakers so I don't want to go
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
over those again I do have a point um to
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
make that I don't believe was brought up
 
05:04:36.548 --> 05:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
so absentee uh ballots they can be
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
requested currently with the application
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
we can receive that back by mail email
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
fax or in person so if you add a notary
 
05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
we can no longer receive them by facts
 
05:04:51.708 --> 05:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
we can no longer receive them by email
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
and I would say a good amount of our
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
requests were actually uh emailed to the
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
clerk's office so you're taking out that
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
aspect of uh the voter being able to
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
email the request in I see in here too
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's if um the absentee request is
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
not notorized they don't provide the ID
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
it says that we shall reject it but I
 
05:05:15.548 --> 05:05:15.558 align:start position:0%
don't see a procedure in here for if we
 
05:05:18.350 --> 05:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
do reject it are we to notify the voter
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
is the clerk or responsible then for
 
05:05:23.070 --> 05:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
some communication with the voter saying
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
that we received your request but now
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's been rejected because you did not
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
provide um all the documentation or have
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
the um the request notorized
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition notaries aren't always
 
05:05:40.390 --> 05:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
free so someone that needs a notary
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
might have to pay for that notary
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
service if the notary comes to their
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
house because their homebound it might
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
be an extra charge for that notary so
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're now basically charging the voter
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
to submit this absentee
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
request um and then my last thing is if
 
05:06:01.788 --> 05:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
someone comes in person to request an
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot why that point would
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
they need their application notorized if
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
they're in person because we talked
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
about uh um similar to inperson voting
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
on Election Day provided your ID you get
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the ballot they're not having anything
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
notorized on that day when they're
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
giving the ID and they're getting the
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
ballot from the ballot clerk but this
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
now would say someone coming in to
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot say a few
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
days prior to the election they show

their ID now their application needs to
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
be notorized now you're treating the
 
05:06:34.510 --> 05:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
absentee voter different than the voter

system of people putting their submit a
 
05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%

05:08:57.430 --> 05:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
us represent it's um 2025 d
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
0216 uh there was question at the we
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
need a second is there a second to the
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Harley bully is
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
second representative Baron would you
 
05:09:06.510 --> 05:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
I would uh so this just kind of cleans
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
up in line eight um where there was some
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
question about who should be present as
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
a second witness witness um it's been
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
changed to this counting shall take
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
place in the presence of another sworn
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
in election official um I was told by
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
Deputy Hennessy that um they're they're
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
fine with this um it still requires that
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's a sworn in elected official and
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
um um that would include if if the
 
05:09:43.868 --> 05:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
selectman or town clerk were there or
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
someone else that's not necessarily busy
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think that was the the issue that may
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
come up during this process is that
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps the clerk or the selectman may
 
05:09:54.430 --> 05:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
be busy with another
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
task further discussion on the
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative Grill so
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this replaces the
 
05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that they be of two separate
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
parties yes okay yes we remove that as
 
05:10:08.670 --> 05:10:08.680 align:start position:0%

exceptionally
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%

introduced Senate Bill 2 and inserted
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
the house language from House Bill
 
05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
1266 relating to the opening of absentee
 
05:16:09.510 --> 05:16:09.520 align:start position:0%

05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
envelopes the the governor issued
 
05:16:15.150 --> 05:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
executive order number 83 relating to
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
Temporary Provisions to respond to
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
timing challenges related to the
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
enactment of Senate Bill 2 to bridge the
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
gap between the then current date in the
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
final enactment of House Bill excuse me
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 2 in the 2021 legislative
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
session in December
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
2021 the election law committee voted
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill to itl acknowledging that
 
05:16:39.040 --> 05:16:39.708 align:start position:0%
Senate bill to itl acknowledging that
the

05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:42.390 --> 05:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
elections which Senate Bill 2 addressed
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
had already taken place under the
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
procedures specified in executive order
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
number 83 and therefore are no longer
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
relevant at the termination of the
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
executive order the statute reverted
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
back to the requirement that abcy ballot
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
outter envelopes could not be opened
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
until election day whereas the early
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
opening significantly benefits all
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to ensure their vote
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
counts Senate House Bill 344 seeks to
 
05:17:14.548 --> 05:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
reestablish that process very simply if
 
05:17:17.070 --> 05:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
you were to submit an absentee Bell and
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
forget to sign the affidavit that
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
envelope would not be opened until
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
election day because you are away which
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
is why you voted by absentee ballot you
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
would not be able to correct the
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
deficiency and your vote would not be
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
counted on the other hand if you were to
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
submit an absentee ballot and forget to
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
sign the affidavit and the deficiency
 
05:17:41.708 --> 05:17:41.718 align:start position:0%
were noted prior to election day there
 
05:17:43.990 --> 05:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
may be the opportunity for an election
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
official to notify you and have the
 
05:17:48.548 --> 05:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
deficiency corrected prior to election
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
day thereby ensuring your ballot vote is
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
counted let's face it we all make
 
05:17:57.270 --> 05:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes but our right to vote is too
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
precious to be thrown away because of a
 
05:18:02.670 --> 05:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
mistake or omissions especially when we
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature have the ability to
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
offer Grace by affording a few days
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
before election day to to determine that
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
everything is in order and that an
 
05:18:15.150 --> 05:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
individual's vote is secure to that end
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask the committee to vote
 
05:18:20.590 --> 05:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 344 ought to pass this
 
05:18:22.628 --> 05:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony and I'd be happy
 
05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you Mr
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%

the last sentence in that uh uh
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph 659
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
49b says you open the ballot uh open the
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
outer envelope but you can't remove the
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
inner um envelope so how can you check
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
the um completeness of the application
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
without being able to take the ballot
 
05:18:56.190 --> 05:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
out or the inner envelope
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%

two hours after the polls open the
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment grants communities the
 
05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
authority to carry out this process any
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
time up to one week before the
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
election due to CO's impact as
 
05:20:31.470 --> 05:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels pointed out
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
Governor Sun sununu authorized this
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
05:20:38.910 --> 05:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
during the week before the fall 2020
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
state and federal elections in Milford
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
we took over the selman's SEL board's
 
05:20:46.750 --> 05:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
meeting room and set up tables where we
 
05:20:48.270 --> 05:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
opened and read aloud the names of the
 
05:20:50.430 --> 05:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
voters who had submitted their absentee
 
05:20:52.708 --> 05:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
ballot members of the two political
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
parties as well as other interested
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
observers could watch and hear the
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
process very easily allowing them to
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
challenge an absentee ballot when
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
necessary importantly as representative
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
Dan Daniels pointed out the town clerk
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
or her assistant was able to reach out
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the voters with incomplete ballot
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits inform them that their ballot
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
would not be counted as is and provide
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
them with the opportunity to corre
 
05:21:24.350 --> 05:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
correct the
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
deficiency absentee ballots that were
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
received after this pre-processing were
 
05:21:32.670 --> 05:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
process as normal on Election
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Day currently the processing of absentee
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
ballot is open to public observation and
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
Aur successfully while the polls are
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
open this amendment reaffirms that while
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
also adding another layer of convenience
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
for those who may challenge absentee
 
05:21:52.070 --> 05:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
voters as well as for the voters who
 
05:21:53.788 --> 05:21:53.798 align:start position:0%
have made an inadvertent mistake on
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
their application and would like to have
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to correct that that
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
ends my testimony and I am welcome to uh
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
take your
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions if there are there questions
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Ward
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:22:10.030 --> 05:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you say that
 
05:22:12.270 --> 05:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
this gives absentee voters the same
 
05:22:14.190 --> 05:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
chance to correct a mistake that a voter
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
in person has when they vote when they
 
05:22:18.510 --> 05:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
can take three ballots if they it's
 
05:22:20.430 --> 05:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
they're not quite the same I think
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative in the sense that um if a
 
05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
person when they check
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
in immediately if there's a question
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
about that person's uh Identity or
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
residence and so forth that can be
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
corrected but in neither case are we
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that they correct the ballot
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's only that the affidavit which has
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
not been signed and which should be
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
signed um has has not been signed so
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
therefore we can they can correct it but
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
that exists that circumstance does not
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
exist with a person who comes into the
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
polling place I just a followup
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
followup yeah I agree with you I think a
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
person who screws up their ballot while
 
05:23:02.830 --> 05:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
they're voting can get another ballot
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
two times you can do it three times that
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct so that's a remedy in the
 
05:23:09.310 --> 05:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
same way you're talking about reming the
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots I'm sorry could you
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
reate your question they're basically
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
saying that an absentee voter has a
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
chance to cure or remedy their ballot
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
they have
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
a correction the they have the ability
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
to sign the affidavit which they had not
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
done prior so they're not having another
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change their ballot right
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
but it fixes a mistake yeah on on a
 
05:23:33.788 --> 05:23:33.798 align:start position:0%
ballot you're
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
right which is what exists today and and
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
the current law also enables that yes I
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
was trying to get rid of two classes of
 
05:23:43.628 --> 05:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
Voters oh I hear you but it sounds like
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
there might be two um always are further
 
05:23:49.230 --> 05:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:23:52.190 --> 05:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative weary uh
 
05:23:53.788 --> 05:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just from a
 
05:23:58.390 --> 05:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
logistical standpoint would there uh
 
05:24:00.628 --> 05:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
this says more than one
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
week would you understand this to be a
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
single time one week prior where all
 
05:24:09.390 --> 05:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots received up to that
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
point are then processed but then
 
05:24:13.628 --> 05:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
anything after that would have to be
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
processed on Election Day as per
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
normal uh practice currently I'm just
 
05:24:22.270 --> 05:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to avoid a
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
long uh extension of Daily Review of
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots prior to the actual
 
05:24:32.270 --> 05:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
election day uh thank you for that
 
05:24:36.310 --> 05:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
question um the the proposal is no more
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
than one week earlier so we're talking
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
about the the Tuesday through the
 
05:24:44.270 --> 05:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
following Monday um and yes I do
 
05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate that would be a day properly
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
noticed uh so anyone that wishes to
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
attend could do
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
that um and you're correct
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
that as in in 2020 the Thursday before
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
the uh uh November election we had uh we
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
did the pre-processing on a Thursday the
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
ballots that were received Friday
 
05:25:08.430 --> 05:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
Saturday Monday and on Election Day
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
would have been processed on Election
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
Day further questions on the committee
 
05:25:12.718 --> 05:25:16.830 align:start position:0%
Day further questions on the committee
representative

05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:20.110 --> 05:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
C okay all right thank you Mr chairman
 
05:25:22.510 --> 05:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh this
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
is a question I posed to sponsor of the
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill um when you're doing this do you
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to take the inner envelope out of
 
05:25:33.788 --> 05:25:33.798 align:start position:0%
the remove it from the outer envelope in
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
order to check the affidavit and
 
05:25:37.628 --> 05:25:37.638 align:start position:0%
everything because the last part of that
 
05:25:39.750 --> 05:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
sentence a last sentence in this
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph which is the existing law
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
which is not changed says you can't do
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
that that's that's correct what happens
 
05:25:52.708 --> 05:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
what what happens is when we we slit the
 
05:25:54.670 --> 05:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope the mailing envelope
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
with a stamp on it if it was mailed as
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
posted delivered in hand um then you you
 
05:26:02.548 --> 05:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
can look at the affidavit envelope on
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
the inside um you may have to turn it 90
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
180 degrees in order to to see it
 
05:26:10.030 --> 05:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon how the person put their
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
their affidavit envelope containing the
 
05:26:14.470 --> 05:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
ballot into the envelope but you're
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
right we don't take it out at that
 
05:26:19.830 --> 05:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
weary uh yes um I'm again I'm just sort
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
um is there a do you do you forese a
 
05:26:32.558 --> 05:26:33.390 align:start position:0%
um is there a do you do you forese a
need

05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
to you specify the discussion that we
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
had about the single day and then uh any
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
accumulated after that single day review
 
05:26:45.670 --> 05:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the affidavits would be done on
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
Election Day or you know do we let that
 
05:26:50.948 --> 05:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
be handled by the election
 
05:26:55.390 --> 05:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
manual well um I I suppose clarification
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that said one time within that that
 
05:27:01.868 --> 05:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
period of no more than one week that
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
could be added uh I think as a practical
 
05:27:07.110 --> 05:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
matter most clerks town and City would
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
not want to do it more than once um and
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that may be the constraint
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
that actually occurs but um so you might
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
wish to consider that as as a a slight
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
change U but the intent certainly is for
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
the um process to occur one time one day
 
05:27:30.110 --> 05:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
duly noted and
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
posted further questions from the
 
05:27:33.990 --> 05:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank
 
05:27:36.670 --> 05:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
youcome Mr Dave Nelson is up next
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
actually uh we are a little behind
 
05:27:39.080 --> 05:27:40.030 align:start position:0%

05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we finish this this
 
05:27:50.430 --> 05:27:50.440 align:start position:0%

05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%

05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
Nelson we're getting there a couple more
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting there yeah thank you um Mr
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee um
 
05:28:06.430 --> 05:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um Dave Nelson um Town
 
05:28:08.670 --> 05:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
moderator from from Derry
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
um I think this would be um a great help
 
05:28:13.628 --> 05:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
um especially for towns like d that tend
 
05:28:16.110 --> 05:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
to have significant numbers of absentee
 
05:28:17.788 --> 05:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
balance we have well over 20,000
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
registered voters so the process can
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
take time um and the ability to um
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
notify folks that they can remedy their
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
their ballots is is certainly a boom to
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
the voters while we were processing them
 
05:28:34.150 --> 05:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
on Election Day I would period
 
05:28:35.548 --> 05:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
periodically go over and if there were
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
ones that were rejected for a cure able
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
defect I would actually call um the the
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
voter if we have the phone number and
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
and let them know that if they were to
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
come down to the election um polling
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
place they could correct the defects but
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
very few people were available to take
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of that and so doing an
 
05:28:58.430 --> 05:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
advance would help um with respect to
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
doing that on one day yes um we want to
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
make that a formal correction um I don't
 
05:29:05.708 --> 05:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
think we would want to do it more than
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
once you have to get the staff you have
 
05:29:09.310 --> 05:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
to do the notice I think it'd be very
 
05:29:11.390 --> 05:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
cumbersome um to do the advanced
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
processing on more than a single day um
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
I support this um bill and I thank you
 
05:29:19.230 --> 05:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
for your time I will take questions
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
05:29:22.510 --> 05:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you next up is
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Kip after that on Deck will be
 
05:29:27.440 --> 05:29:30.190 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Kip after that on Deck will be
McKenzie

05:29:30.190 --> 05:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:36.430 --> 05:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:38.470 --> 05:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chair chairman members
 
05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee Jonathan Kip I'm the
 
05:29:42.510 --> 05:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
town moderator in the town of londonairy
 
05:29:46.230 --> 05:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
um I also am in favor of this bill and
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh recommend that it uh that it it pass
 
05:29:53.310 --> 05:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
um I won't repeat what my colleague my
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
two prior colleagues have said because I
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with them however there are a
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
couple of um I think unintended positive
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
consequences of this
 
05:30:07.070 --> 05:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
practice um one is that it gives us a
 
05:30:09.310 --> 05:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
great opportunity to educate voters when
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
we pre-process absentee ballots it's a
 
05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
much calmer environment it's open
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's not a crowd and uh I know when
 
05:30:19.230 --> 05:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
we did it in 2020 for the general
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
election I had the opportunity to chat
 
05:30:25.150 --> 05:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
with voters who came in to observe and
 
05:30:27.310 --> 05:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
poll Challengers who were there and we
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
just established a great line of
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
communication and I'll respectfully
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that if you haven't already
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
that committee members review the final
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
report of the special committee on voter
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
confidence that was released on December
 
05:30:40.558 --> 05:30:42.110 align:start position:0%
confidence that was released on December
22nd

05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
22nd
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
2022 one of their recommendations was to
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
expand voter education efforts and I see
 
05:30:52.030 --> 05:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
this as a um a great opportunity to do
 
05:30:52.040 --> 05:30:53.470 align:start position:0%
this as a um a great opportunity to do
exactly

05:30:53.470 --> 05:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
that and another benefit that others
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned was the opportunity for
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
absentee voters to come in if they're
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
available to remedy whatever the
 
05:31:06.670 --> 05:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
deficiency was in their submission and
 
05:31:08.670 --> 05:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
it may be unique only to London Derry
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I doubt it if we do it on a day
 
05:31:12.990 --> 05:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
other than election day they can find a
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
parking place quickly and come in and do
 
05:31:20.150 --> 05:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
it um a second recommendation of this
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
special committee was it addressed in
 
05:31:27.548 --> 05:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
uh under recommendations Roman numeral
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
ey number four absentee ballot
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
improvements and with uh with your
 
05:31:35.270 --> 05:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
permission I will read the short segment
 
05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
they wrote on this you have you have one
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
minute M um s so just be judicious
 
05:31:42.670 --> 05:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
consideration should be given by the
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to allow for the
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots by
 
05:31:48.510 --> 05:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
opening the outer envelopes as was
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowed in 2020 for all elections
 
05:31:54.030 --> 05:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
testimony stated that it worked well
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
aided local officials in completing
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
their jobs and did not affect accuracy
 
05:32:00.430 --> 05:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
or security and we can attest to that in
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
London Derry when we pre-processed 5,800
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots the day before the
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
election in November of 2020 I'll be
 
05:32:10.190 --> 05:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain questions questions
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative we uh just uh
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%

05:32:30.350 --> 05:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
election yes sir we keep our ballots in
 
05:32:31.868 --> 05:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
the town hall vault which is directly
 
05:32:33.628 --> 05:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
across the street from where we hold the
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh hold the elections police escort we
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
took the ballots over the day before the
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
election day pre-processed them and then
 
05:32:41.948 --> 05:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
with the police escort took them back
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
and placed them back in the vault until
 
05:32:43.440 --> 05:32:44.910 align:start position:0%
and placed them back in the vault until
election

05:32:44.910 --> 05:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
day further questions from the committee
 
05:32:49.470 --> 05:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh next up
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%

05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
Goodwin like like a b b
 
05:33:04.708 --> 05:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.910 --> 05:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon I'm Mackenzie
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
Taylor with New Hampshire campaign for
 
05:33:10.110 --> 05:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
voting rights and America votes um we
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
are in support of this legislation um
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
and in support of uh pre-processing
 
05:33:16.750 --> 05:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots it's been a priority of
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
ours for um basically since 2020 or
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
before um one thing I wanted to kind of
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
reemphasize is there are you know a
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
level of envelopes and ballots there's
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
the outside envelope that gets mailed to
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
the town There's the envelope inside
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
where the voter signs that affidavit and
 
05:33:35.548 --> 05:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
then the ballot is inside that so
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
reemphasizing that um that ballot itself
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
is still in that sealed envelope and not
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
coming out or being opened until
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
election day when they're going through
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
the machines so there's a good level of
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
security there uh one of the other
 
05:33:50.670 --> 05:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
reasons that in addition to things that
 
05:33:53.070 --> 05:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
have been said today um in addition to
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
um the support from election officials
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
that we support pre-processing is
 
05:33:58.990 --> 05:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
greater transparency um being able to
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
have more noticed sessions ahead of time
 
05:34:04.868 --> 05:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
where voters acoss the town can go and
 
05:34:07.230 --> 05:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
watch the processing of absentee ballots
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
watch the envelopes be opened and
 
05:34:11.230 --> 05:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
checked versus sometimes the chaos and
 
05:34:14.110 --> 05:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
kind of just busy days on Election Day
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
um having that additional time on the
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
front end um to have greater
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
transparency and voter confidence um and
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
finally like other said an ability for
 
05:34:25.750 --> 05:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
voters to cure their ballots if they
 
05:34:27.750 --> 05:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
somehow on that form forgot a signature
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
forgot to fill in some information to
 
05:34:31.708 --> 05:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can have that ballot
 
05:34:34.590 --> 05:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
count ahead of election day um
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
especially because with our absentee
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
voting process uh most folks who um are
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
voting absentee are not able to go to
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
the polls on Election Day so it gives
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
them the chance to have the extra time
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
to do that ahead of time and ensure
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
their vote counts um and I'm happy to
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
answer questions if there are any
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
05:34:55.070 --> 05:34:55.080 align:start position:0%

05:34:55.080 --> 05:34:57.190 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh next up is Autumn

05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
Rost
 
05:34:59.310 --> 05:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
Goodwin uh that's the last up
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative gy can you grab me that
 
05:35:08.548 --> 05:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
all right uh for the record my name is
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
Autumn rashik Goodwin program
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
coordinator for open democracy I live in
 
05:35:16.670 --> 05:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I'm
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of HB
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
344 um in the name of expediency several
 
05:35:24.670 --> 05:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
of the points that I was going to make
 
05:35:26.190 --> 05:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
in my testimony today have already been
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
made by previous speakers so I just
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight two things here and
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
then I'll yield um first is when people
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
are filling out their absentee ballots
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly easy for someone who
 
05:35:41.548 --> 05:35:41.558 align:start position:0%
who's distracted or in a rush to forget
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
a signature or make some slight mistake
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
on that outer envelope so having this
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
method of curing in advance is crucial
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um and additionally this is a very
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
popular idea there are 43 States and the
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
Virgin Islands that permit election
 
05:36:00.750 --> 05:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
officials to begin processing absentee
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
ballots in mailing ballots in advance of
 
05:36:04.080 --> 05:36:05.788 align:start position:0%
ballots in mailing ballots in advance of
Elections

05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
so with that I encourage vote
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
OTP there questions from the
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you I don't
 
05:36:17.310 --> 05:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
have any else any other pink cards um
 
05:36:19.750 --> 05:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
signed up in person 1 two three four
 
05:36:25.628 --> 05:36:25.638 align:start position:0%
five six 7 8 9 10 12 in favor zero
 
05:36:29.070 --> 05:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
opposed online 428 in support 63 in
 
05:36:32.430 --> 05:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
opposed uh with that I'm going to close
 
05:36:35.110 --> 05:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 344
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to reopen executive session
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
for a statement
 
05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to reopen executive
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
session without objection I've shown
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
this list to the ranking member we are
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to place house bills 336 relative
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
to the placement of political signs on
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
rways House Bill 448 establishing a
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee to study violations by the
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
April 25th 2023 election law bout law
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh House Bill 626 directing
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to implement a
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
vulnerability disclosure program for
 
05:37:04.750 --> 05:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
certain election systems and cacr 3
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
relating to recall elections providing
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the general court May authorize
 
05:37:10.230 --> 05:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
recall elections on the consent calendar
 
05:37:10.240 --> 05:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
recall elections on the consent calendar
without

05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
objection yes representative c u i was
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
under the understanding that cacr could
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
not go on consent they can when they're
 
05:37:23.470 --> 05:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
being defeated okay thank um and the
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
reason that 327 is not going on the
 
05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
consent calendar is it has a fiscal note
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it cannot go on the consent calendar
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
um but without objection those four
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
bills be placed on the consent calendar
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't want a nasty note from
 
05:37:35.350 --> 05:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk so no objection all right and
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'm closing executive session all
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
now we're going to open the public
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
hearing for house B 608 uh requiring the
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
moderator to inspect absentee ballot
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
affidavits for full execution including
 
05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
use of a notary election officer or any
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
other person authorized by law to
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
administer Oaths and I thank
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%

okay objection all right
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
um HB 608 is being introduced to address
 
05:38:32.190 --> 05:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh three uh critical areas where New
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire election law and procedures uh
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
fall short constitutionally and
 
05:38:41.390 --> 05:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively in regards to absentee
 
05:38:45.468 --> 05:38:45.478 align:start position:0%
voters um New Hampshire passed House
 
05:38:45.478 --> 05:38:46.990 align:start position:0%
voters um New Hampshire passed House
Bill

05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:38:52.230 --> 05:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
1569 in 2024 which requires all voters
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
to present
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
identification um it was an oversight
 
05:38:59.430 --> 05:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
that this aspect of our election on
 
05:39:01.868 --> 05:39:01.878 align:start position:0%
unverified absentee voters was not
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
corrected when this legislation was
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
codified uh HB 608 will fix this
 
05:39:12.190 --> 05:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
um in 2020 before
 
05:39:15.390 --> 05:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
2020 uh with historical absentee voter
 
05:39:18.510 --> 05:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
rates hovering around 3% this issue went
 
05:39:20.390 --> 05:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
unchecked it didn't seem to be a big
 
05:39:24.310 --> 05:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
deal uh in 2020 even though we can't fix
 
05:39:26.468 --> 05:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2020 we certainly can
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
learn from it uh with the expansion of
 
05:39:32.468 --> 05:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
uh reasons to vote absentee under covid
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee voters ballooned
 
05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
to 32% imagine 32% of the ballots were
 
05:39:43.548 --> 05:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
cast with no ID postco in the 2024
 
05:39:46.030 --> 05:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
presidential election the Hampshire had
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
just under 100,000 absentee voters at
 
05:39:52.190 --> 05:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
12% more than four times the historical
 
05:39:55.948 --> 05:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
Norms preo this is a growing problem
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is not going away and as we as
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
legislators we need to uh fix this and
 
05:40:04.750 --> 05:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
HB 608 will take care of that uh that
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
list that you received uh on the prior
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
bill showing all the towns that were uh
 
05:40:13.868 --> 05:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
overvotes like Waterville Valley had a
 
05:40:18.190 --> 05:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
192% voter turnout um that's from the
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
actual work that uh we all did uh after
 
05:40:25.590 --> 05:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election and those numbers um
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
are shocking and we're trying to protect
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's votes here um you know this
 
05:40:33.990 --> 05:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
is um bipod is an issue and we're just
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
trying to protect everybody's votes
 
05:40:37.390 --> 05:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm going to give the
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
remainder of my time to Daniel
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
Richards chairman members of the
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you again for your time
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
I want to address this issue from a
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
different angle what we're dealing with
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
here is an unresolved conflict in 1979
 
05:40:54.350 --> 05:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
when the modifications to our election
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
laws were put in place they removed the
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
notary certificate so it had Bill
 
05:41:01.030 --> 05:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
Gardner convinced the legislature to rec
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
codify all our election laws which they
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
did and so the absentee affidavit
 
05:41:09.390 --> 05:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
requirement was simply omitted when they
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
when they uh amended the physical
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
disability clause and when they did so
 
05:41:16.510 --> 05:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
the state Secretary of State's office
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
has been calling the return envelope an
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
affidavit instrument there's a big
 
05:41:22.990 --> 05:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
difference between the current envelope
 
05:41:25.230 --> 05:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
which is self- attestation self-
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
attestation again would be permissible
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
if the legislature chose to make that be
 
05:41:34.190 --> 05:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
the rule the problem is you make the law
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State and the Attorney
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
General's office don't make law
 
05:41:40.110 --> 05:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
separation of powers but this is where
 
05:41:42.430 --> 05:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
the conflict lies what they did is they
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
removed the previous duty of the voter
 
05:41:46.990 --> 05:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
when this when the affidavit requirement
 
05:41:49.628 --> 05:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
was put in in 1942 also was the
 
05:41:51.708 --> 05:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement for the voter to
 
05:41:54.030 --> 05:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
repeat the in-person process the
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
in-person process is you show up you
 
05:41:58.230 --> 05:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
produce an ID you're given a ballot you
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
mark your ballot in the vicinity of the
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
election officials you deposit it in in
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
a box or a machine under a secure
 
05:42:07.390 --> 05:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
environment to your point sir about the
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
the verification right and so what they
 
05:42:11.468 --> 05:42:11.478 align:start position:0%
did is they made it equal so it would be
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
the same and so after marking the ballot
 
05:42:17.030 --> 05:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
then the voter would put the ballot
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
inside of his envelope with an
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
eyewitness that eyewitness would sign
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
the notary certificate so that when the
 
05:42:25.548 --> 05:42:25.558 align:start position:0%
moderator got the envelope and he looks
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
at it and says is the affidavit properly
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
executed he could see that it was or it
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't and another gentleman mentioned
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
the issue of um not being able to check
 
05:42:40.190 --> 05:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
these things well like I said earlier
 
05:42:44.830 --> 05:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
32% that's 260,000 absentee ballots were
 
05:42:47.310 --> 05:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
counted in the 2020 election none of
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
them were verified since
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
1979 we have not had any verification of
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
any absentee ballots except for those
 
05:42:58.510 --> 05:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
people who return to their polling
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
districts and turn them in in person
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
because if you do that today your
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
election staff is more than happy to
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
take that in and act as a notary under
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
under the previous law that was just
 
05:43:10.670 --> 05:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
repealed they went ahead and had that
 
05:43:13.390 --> 05:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
provision so you had five people notary
 
05:43:16.948 --> 05:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
JP moderator selectman and clerk all can
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
act in that capacity the local banking
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
center I my bank doesn't charge me to
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
notorized anything so again this issue
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
all has to do with the equal application
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the law we have a problem and it's a
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
loophole if you have the moderator who's
 
05:43:33.510 --> 05:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
required to make sure the affid was
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
properly executed and he's not doing his
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
job the step the follow statute says
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
he's got to dispose of that ballot
 
05:43:43.468 --> 05:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
65953 defective material right across
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
the face ballot defective for failure to
 
05:43:48.430 --> 05:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
execute a proper affidavit again if
 
05:43:51.030 --> 05:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to require attestation let
 
05:43:53.310 --> 05:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature make that change but not
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office because
 
05:43:56.430 --> 05:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing now thank you
 
05:43:57.628 --> 05:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
thank you your time has expired Mr
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
Richard um any questions questions i'
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
love to answer you question hearing none
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman members of
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Secretary of State
 
05:44:21.788 --> 05:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
David scandin and I understand it's been
 
05:44:24.750 --> 05:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
a really long day for you so I'll try
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
and be as brief as I can on this um what
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for if you look at the
 
05:44:34.430 --> 05:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself is responsibility of the
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
moderator when processing the absentee B
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
ballots to make sure certain things are
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
correct U when they do that that's RSA
 
05:44:45.628 --> 05:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
659 colon
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
50 uh and this deals with Roman numeral
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
1 B and so if you look at the statute
 
05:44:53.628 --> 05:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
completely it just says that the
 
05:44:55.868 --> 05:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
moderator is supposed to do this Duty
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
and it says if the name of the voter is
 
05:45:00.270 --> 05:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
on the checklist and the affidavit
 
05:45:04.110 --> 05:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
appears to be properly executed and the
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
signature uh on the affidavit appears to
 
05:45:09.548 --> 05:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
be executed by the same person then the
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
then the absentee ballot gets processed
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.628 --> 05:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
language when the Moder is looking at
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
this that the affidavit on the absentee
 
05:45:24.990 --> 05:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
ballot envelope is a fully executed
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
legal affidavit that is witnessed and
 
05:45:30.628 --> 05:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
signed by a notary election officer or
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
any other person authorized by law to
 
05:45:33.360 --> 05:45:34.708 align:start position:0%
any other person authorized by law to
administer

05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
administer
 
05:45:37.708 --> 05:45:37.718 align:start position:0%
Ro now if if that's the policy that the
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
legislature wants that's one thing and
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take an opinion on that
 
05:45:46.350 --> 05:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
today but what I am trying to point out
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
with this language is that this will
 
05:45:49.708 --> 05:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
cause Mass
 
05:45:53.948 --> 05:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
confusion because the the the language
 
05:45:56.468 --> 05:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
that we need to be looking at for what
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
is contained on the so-called affidavit
 
05:46:01.868 --> 05:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
envelope is in RSA
 
05:46:05.948 --> 05:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
657 col 7 and that language says that
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State State shall put
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
the following language on the affidavit
 
05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
envelope and there is no provision in
 
05:46:15.708 --> 05:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
the statute that says that there's
 
05:46:18.190 --> 05:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a place or an opportunity
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
on there for a notary or some other
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
person to take the oath of office to do
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
that so if that were added then this
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
language that is being proposed in this
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill might be appropriate but
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
um it's it at this point I don't believe
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:46:39.150 --> 05:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that I'd like to
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
point out too is that you know absentee
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
balloting really started uh taking
 
05:46:47.708 --> 05:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
place uh in the Constitution and
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
statutorily in the area of the
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
1940s and in 1943 in in the law book in
 
05:46:57.750 --> 05:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
the election laws of that time um there
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity for the voter to sign
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
the the statement that they were who
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
they say they are uh and as Mr Richard
 
05:47:10.350 --> 05:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
said have a witness watch
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
them uh uh not Mark the ballot but take
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
the marked ballot the done in private
 
05:47:20.590 --> 05:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
put it in the the uh envelope which
 
05:47:23.868 --> 05:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
contained the affidavit on it and then
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
sign a witness oath that you know they
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
did in fact observe the voter following
 
05:47:31.468 --> 05:47:31.478 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
process in
 
05:47:36.430 --> 05:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
1955 the law was changed to remove that
 
05:47:36.440 --> 05:47:38.030 align:start position:0%
1955 the law was changed to remove that
provision

05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:47:40.468 --> 05:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
and in that time that statement on the
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope was not called an
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
affidavit it was called a
 
05:47:47.548 --> 05:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
certificate and that language has
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
continued up until the legislature
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
really started addressing the a the
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
laws within the last 10 years or so
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
1979 was when the legislature recodified
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the election statutes but those
 
05:48:06.030 --> 05:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions that I'd mentioned before
 
05:48:07.390 --> 05:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
kind of carry
 
05:48:12.030 --> 05:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that and so uh today the the
 
05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
language is you know has changed
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
recently but it calls the affid the
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
envelope with the statement on it an
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope but I believe it
 
05:48:25.750 --> 05:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
still calls the statement that is on
 
05:48:29.708 --> 05:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
there a certificate bottom line is the
 
05:48:32.468 --> 05:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has directions on the
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
language that shall appear on the
 
05:48:37.788 --> 05:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit that's what we do and that's
 
05:48:40.430 --> 05:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
what the moderators are supposed to be
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh watching for when they process the
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and with that I would
 
05:48:46.510 --> 05:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
05:48:48.990 --> 05:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee repr Lane um what do you
 
05:48:57.468 --> 05:48:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.478 --> 05:48:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
affidavit

05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
well I think in this case the affidavit
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
is what the legislature calls it
 
05:49:07.030 --> 05:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
um but I mean that I'm sure sure that
 
05:49:10.750 --> 05:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
there is a legal definition of what a an
 
05:49:13.948 --> 05:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
affidavit constitutes and and I think uh
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Richard is well uh schooled in that
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
but I but I think the legislature can
 
05:49:23.190 --> 05:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
say something and mean something else
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.130 --> 05:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
that maybe I should rephrase
 
05:49:31.140 --> 05:49:33.910 align:start position:0%
that maybe I should rephrase
[Laughter]

05:49:33.910 --> 05:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
that but but but I I think I think in
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
this case it it was it was just uh uh um
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
Loosely throwing around words and what
 
05:49:48.510 --> 05:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
they actually mean um
 
05:49:51.468 --> 05:49:51.478 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it at that further
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee to take him
 
05:49:56.030 --> 05:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit off the hook we experienced
 
05:49:57.390 --> 05:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
that last year we went through the
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform a lot of
 
05:50:02.468 --> 05:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
conflicting definitions and a lot of
 
05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
terms used that were not defined so yeah
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
it we we amend things on and off and it
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's really hard to catch
 
05:50:14.110 --> 05:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
everything so thank you um further
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%

05:50:51.788 --> 05:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon chair Barry and members of the
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Linda Bundy and I'm
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
from antrum I oppose HB 608 requiring
 
05:51:00.750 --> 05:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
moderators to inspect absentee ballot
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
affidavits for full execution including
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
use of a notary election officer or any
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
person authorized by law to administer
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
Oaths currently absentee ballots must
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
have a signed affidavit from the voter
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
and anyone who assisted the voter in
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
completing their ballot by adding the
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
extra step of getting the ballots
 
05:51:24.468 --> 05:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
notorized or signed by an authorized
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
official HB 608 places an undue burden
 
05:51:30.990 --> 05:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
on absentee voters many of whom are
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
senior citizens or people with
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities obtaining
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
notorized authorized signature will
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
likely prevent a significant percentage
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
of these populations from voting I
 
05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
searched the New Hampshire attorney
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
general's website for absentee ballot
 
05:51:52.110 --> 05:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
fraud I didn't find fraud per se but
 
05:51:54.190 --> 05:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
there were letters concerning absentee
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not counted in the
 
05:51:58.990 --> 05:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
towns of Bedford marac and Nottingham in
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election there were no
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
instances of fraud by individual voters
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
I believe that HB 608 will prevent
 
05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
eligible voters from casting absentee
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
ballots and is unnecessary legislation I
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
ask that you vote inexpedient to
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
legislate on this Bill thank you for
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
your time thank you will you be taking
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions Miss Bundy nope ex I love it

K yeah I I have a thing I have a huge
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
pet peeve when committees run behind and
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
then I have to sit there for three hours
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
and it's like all I have to do is
 
05:53:00.070 --> 05:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill so I let
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives introduce it and then I
 
05:53:03.390 --> 05:53:03.400 align:start position:0%

05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the election law committee
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn cab and I'm here to introduce
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:53:17.830 --> 05:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
269 which is a very simple change which
 
05:53:17.840 --> 05:53:19.430 align:start position:0%
269 which is a very simple change which
is

05:53:19.430 --> 05:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
removing the word Saturday um from
 
05:53:27.468 --> 05:53:27.478 align:start position:0%
when for the last date to to correct the
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
voter checklist so to just give a little
 
05:53:32.310 --> 05:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
background on this back in 2016
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bates had a
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill to remove all the references to
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
Saturday and to only say it used to say
 
05:53:42.310 --> 05:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
that it had to be the Saturday 10 days
 
05:53:44.750 --> 05:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the election and then he made
 
05:53:48.510 --> 05:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
it some changes which went
 
05:53:52.590 --> 05:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
into 654 27 which made it say that they
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist were
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to designate a day six to 13 days
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
prior to the election and the real
 
05:53:59.868 --> 05:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is because we live in
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
New England and there's snowstorms so we
 
05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to pin down the supervisors
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the checklist to have to
 
05:54:10.670 --> 05:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
have a meeting during a big blizzard
 
05:54:12.110 --> 05:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
because they have to do it on Saturday
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't make sense that's not
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
helping the voters
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
and or anybody so this is just simply
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
making that one correction to that last
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
reference to Saturday that should not
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
have been in there and that's all this
 
05:54:26.750 --> 05:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill is doing and I'm happy to take any
 
05:54:28.270 --> 05:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
kab seeing none thank you going to
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
recess the public hearing on House Bill
 
05:54:37.468 --> 05:54:37.478 align:start position:0%
629 and reopen the public hearing on
 
05:54:43.390 --> 05:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.350 --> 05:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman and members
 
05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Dave
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
Nelson Derry Town moderator thank you
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony um I want to be
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
clear what it is that moderators need to
 
05:55:07.628 --> 05:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
actually inspect and verify with respect
 
05:55:10.510 --> 05:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
to the content of the affidavit
 
05:55:14.910 --> 05:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
so-called that as listed in this bill um
 
05:55:17.708 --> 05:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
we already know that moderators are not
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to do signature comparison
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
between the signature on the affidavit
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the application because of a New
 
05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decision that it
 
05:55:27.948 --> 05:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
holds that we don't not have we do not
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
have that technical skill um in cry
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
Crypt analysis to um compare signatures
 
05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
and so I would ask for some guidance
 
05:55:39.510 --> 05:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of determining that it had
 
05:55:41.230 --> 05:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
been notorized
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
um or witnessed by either a not election
 
05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
officer or any other person authorized
 
05:55:50.430 --> 05:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
by law to administer Oaths um if we
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't compare two signatures that are
 
05:55:57.070 --> 05:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
sensibly of um the applicant how are we
 
05:56:00.548 --> 05:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
to verify with any level of certainty
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
that those witnessing signatures whether
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
they be notary Justice of the Peace
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
Office of the Superior Court whatever
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
are actually who they say they are um
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
just concerns me that the moderators are
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
asked to again do something that is
 
05:56:16.670 --> 05:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
probably beyond our our skill set thank
 
05:56:18.468 --> 05:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
you will you be taking questions from
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
the committee um absolutely all right
 
05:56:21.628 --> 05:56:21.638 align:start position:0%

05:56:36.270 --> 05:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
goodwi one thank you uh Dan Hy Nash City
 
05:56:39.150 --> 05:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
Clerk and I oppose this bill I have uh
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
similar concerns that I mentioned
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
previously with the notary
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
um homebound residents are going to have
 
05:56:49.030 --> 05:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
a tough time getting getting the
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit notorized
 
05:56:55.150 --> 05:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
um and you know my office we charge $2
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
for a notary if someone comes in I
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
believe we' probably wave that if we're
 
05:57:01.868 --> 05:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
notorized absentee envelopes but there
 
05:57:05.230 --> 05:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
are fees associated with notaries um and
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
again especially if they're coming to
 
05:57:08.788 --> 05:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
someone's house and then my second
 
05:57:10.350 --> 05:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
concern which I don't believe has been
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned is um speaking with a few
 
05:57:14.628 --> 05:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
other clerks we have some concerns that
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
a notary might put their notary stamp
 
05:57:17.948 --> 05:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
right through the ballot the ballots
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
already in the envelope it's they sign
 
05:57:23.628 --> 05:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
it in front of the person and then they
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
stamp their seal and it presses down
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the ballot so uh those are the the
 
05:57:32.190 --> 05:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
two big concerns um uh that I have and
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
may be open to any questions questions
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
05:57:48.468 --> 05:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
Taylor good afternoon one final time
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
today uh Mackenzie tayor with the New
 
05:57:54.030 --> 05:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights and
 
05:57:57.548 --> 05:57:57.558 align:start position:0%
America votes um we oppose this bill um
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
echoing the points we've brought up
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
earlier about notarizing um and the
 
05:58:04.910 --> 05:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
number of or the number of uh the cost
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
and difficulty in having not a notary
 
05:58:09.390 --> 05:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
potentially come to a home for people
 
05:58:11.230 --> 05:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
who are voting absentee because they
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
aren't able to travel um and the cost
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
and kind of different steps there for
 
05:58:18.750 --> 05:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
something that is um someone's right to
 
05:58:20.948 --> 05:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
vote and to be able to vote absentee if
 
05:58:23.310 --> 05:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
they are unable to go in person uh the
 
05:58:24.990 --> 05:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
other concern I wanted to bring up with
 
05:58:26.590 --> 05:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically is because it is
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the envelopes themselves that go uh
 
05:58:32.670 --> 05:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
to the polls without pre-processing um
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
if those ballots or those inside
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
envelopes are only looked at on election
 
05:58:38.430 --> 05:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
day if folks make mistakes with a new
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
process with a pretty high burden of
 
05:58:43.468 --> 05:58:43.478 align:start position:0%
having something notorized um most of
 
05:58:45.390 --> 05:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
those folks because they have attested
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
that they can't vote on Election Day be
 
05:58:49.948 --> 05:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
unable to go to the polls un and fix
 
05:58:52.110 --> 05:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
their ballot um and be able to vote in
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
persons the number of ballots that could
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be rejected um because they
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh weren't you know there was a new
 
05:59:01.030 --> 05:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
process there was more difficulty and
 
05:59:02.670 --> 05:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
things weren't necessarily notorized um
 
05:59:03.990 --> 05:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the number of Voters who would be
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised for that reason um and
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
05:59:14.110 --> 05:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
thank you last up is Autumn rashik
 
05:59:18.230 --> 05:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
it eventually I mean poor uh poor Kaylee
 
05:59:24.990 --> 05:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
she's gone through many iterations of
 
05:59:25.000 --> 05:59:28.868 align:start position:0%
she's gone through many iterations of
name

05:59:28.868 --> 05:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
AB all right uh for the record my name
 
05:59:34.350 --> 05:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
is Autumn rashik Goodwin I'm the program
 
05:59:36.110 --> 05:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator for open democracy and I
 
05:59:38.190 --> 05:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester New Hampshire and I
 
05:59:43.150 --> 05:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
am testifying in opposition of HB 608 um
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
many of the points that I aimed to make
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
have already been made by other speakers
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
and since we're behind time I'll speed
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
it along uh so basically again
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
reiterating that this can put undue
 
05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
strain on absentee voters who largely
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
are members of the disability Community
 
06:00:05.390 --> 06:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
the elderly and having to find a notary
 
06:00:05.400 --> 06:00:06.750 align:start position:0%
the elderly and having to find a notary
to

06:00:06.750 --> 06:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that their ballots are counted
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
puts an extra step into their process
 
06:00:14.468 --> 06:00:14.478 align:start position:0%
for casting their ballot um and could
 
06:00:16.270 --> 06:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
lead to the disenfranchisement of those
 
06:00:16.280 --> 06:00:17.548 align:start position:0%
lead to the disenfranchisement of those
voters

06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
voters
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
potentially um so it is with that reason
 
06:00:23.430 --> 06:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
that I urge the committee to vote itl on
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
HB 608 will you be taking questions from
 
06:00:28.590 --> 06:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
the committee sure are there questions
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee no oh yes
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative wey uh thank you Mr chair
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
06:00:38.310 --> 06:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure the populations that you've
 
06:00:43.510 --> 06:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned are not immune from having to
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
verify their identity in other
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances is there any
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation you would have for the
 
06:00:51.150 --> 06:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
committee that we would be able to
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
verify the the identity of these people
 
06:00:57.670 --> 06:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
and in in a way you know that would have
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
an equal treatment of of
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
Voters I would have to look into that
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%

hello my name is Eileen moshimo and I
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
have just entered my 13th year as a
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the voter checklist in the
 
06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
town of
 
06:02:17.468 --> 06:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
wiam when then State Rep David Bates
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
joined me as a supervisor I relayed to
 
06:02:22.110 --> 06:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
him that some of the rsas were very
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
outdated one was the RSA that
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors were notified of a voter's
 
06:02:29.670 --> 06:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
death by the town clerk but only if the
 
06:02:32.708 --> 06:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
person died in my town the law was
 
06:02:35.150 --> 06:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
written long before the age of computers
 
06:02:37.030 --> 06:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
David submitted a bill for the Secretary
 
06:02:38.990 --> 06:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
of State to notify supervisors of
 
06:02:41.548 --> 06:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
matches between recorded death records
 
06:02:43.868 --> 06:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
and voter records anywhere in the state
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
we are now notified through the state
 
06:02:47.310 --> 06:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
voter registration system within days of
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
a voter's death anywhere in the state
 
06:02:51.910 --> 06:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
David also submitted a bill giving
 
06:02:54.270 --> 06:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
supervisors more flexibility in
 
06:02:56.628 --> 06:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
scheduling their last sessions prior to
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
elections prior to any state federal
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
primary Village district meeting or town
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
election we were required to hold a
 
06:03:09.110 --> 06:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
session between 11:30 11 a.m. and 11:30
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
a.m. on the Saturday between 6 and 13
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
days prior to the
 
06:03:16.430 --> 06:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
election David put in proposed
 
06:03:19.390 --> 06:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to take out the words 11:30
 
06:03:23.868 --> 06:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
a.m. to 11:30 uh 11: a.m. to 11:30 a.m.
 
06:03:26.708 --> 06:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
on the Saturday the bill was legislated
 
06:03:29.430 --> 06:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
and passed unfortunately it was not
 
06:03:31.868 --> 06:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
discovered until the next year that the
 
06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
word Saturday was not taken out in one
 
06:03:36.430 --> 06:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
of the five or six places that were
 
06:03:37.948 --> 06:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
located in the
 
06:03:40.830 --> 06:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
rsas the word Saturday remaining in the
 
06:03:42.990 --> 06:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
section of the law pertaining to town
 
06:03:45.230 --> 06:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
elections has C caused some major
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
inconveniences and safety issues none
 
06:03:50.110 --> 06:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
worse than March 4th
 
06:03:52.868 --> 06:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
2023 when the state was hit with a major
 
06:03:55.230 --> 06:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
snowstorm when snow was falling at a
 
06:03:58.030 --> 06:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
rate of 1 inch an hour some areas of New
 
06:04:01.230 --> 06:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had well over 18 to 24 in of
 
06:04:04.270 --> 06:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
snow in the days preceding the snowstorm
 
06:04:06.030 --> 06:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary state's office has sent
 
06:04:10.468 --> 06:04:10.478 align:start position:0%
out a memo requ uh requiring all
 
06:04:13.110 --> 06:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor or informing all supervisors
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the rsas required us to meet that
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
day no Exceptions there was no way to
 
06:04:22.270 --> 06:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
postpone to another day our town had to
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
have snowplow snowplow diverted from
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
cleaning the streets to Our Town Hall
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
Parking Lot in order for the town hall
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
parking lot to be cleared enough that we
 
06:04:34.110 --> 06:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
could hold our meeting in other areas of
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
the state supervisors had to choose
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
between personal safety or violating the
 
06:04:41.590 --> 06:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
law all this could have been avoided if
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
the word Saturday was not in the law
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
where it is right now I simply ask you
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
to pass the law to remove the word
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
Saturday keeping the word in the RSA
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't was an apparent oversight but
 
06:04:56.310 --> 06:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
keeping it in can continue to cause
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors great difficulties thank you
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay will you be taking questions from
 
06:05:01.200 --> 06:05:02.468 align:start position:0%
okay will you be taking questions from
the

06:05:02.468 --> 06:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:05.948 --> 06:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
committee okay hearing none um thank you
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:15.468 --> 06:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
thanks good afternoon again uh Tina
 
06:05:21.868 --> 06:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
Guilford Derry town clerk um for a lot
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that the previous speaker
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
spoke um is why I came up um in 2023 we
 
06:05:30.350 --> 06:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
also had to divert resources from
 
06:05:33.310 --> 06:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
cleaning our streets to keeping the Town
 
06:05:36.190 --> 06:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hall Parking Lot clear for for our
 
06:05:38.030 --> 06:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors and any members of the
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
public that may attend the
 
06:05:43.390 --> 06:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
session um I've also found that very
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
often the week before the election seems
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
to be when people really get interested
 
06:05:52.868 --> 06:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:05:56.230 --> 06:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
election and the Monday and Tuesday be
 
06:05:59.868 --> 06:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
you know before that week before often
 
06:06:01.990 --> 06:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be when they come in and they
 
06:06:03.910 --> 06:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
remember that they never registered to
 
06:06:07.350 --> 06:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
vote in our town or they never uh you
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
know and they you know and they remember
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
ooh I need to do this and and basically
 
06:06:15.270 --> 06:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
what happens is we end up making telling
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
them they either need to go on Election
 
06:06:20.030 --> 06:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
Day and register which
 
06:06:24.910 --> 06:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
causes you know one wonderful lines or
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know they have to register absentee
 
06:06:29.270 --> 06:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to be able to be
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
there uh so the flexibility would be
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
great so that our supervisors could have
 
06:06:38.030 --> 06:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
their session you know the week before
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
the election when people are actually
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
finally interested especially in the
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
town election CU they just don't seem to
 
06:06:45.600 --> 06:06:46.430 align:start position:0%
town election CU they just don't seem to
show

06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
show
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
up and I will take any questions
 
06:06:51.910 --> 06:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
06:06:54.350 --> 06:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um there was one person on the
 
06:06:55.868 --> 06:06:55.878 align:start position:0%

06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
speak that was deputy secretary of state

enabling selectman to add additional
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
polling places and requiring selectman
 
06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
to give no to voters 30 days before
 
06:07:38.830 --> 06:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
providing such additional polling
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
places thank you thanks for hearing um I
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
Christine Perez London da Rockingham 16
 
06:07:50.510 --> 06:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
so last November the country the state
 
06:07:52.750 --> 06:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
and our towns all had unprecedented
 
06:07:55.030 --> 06:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
turnout of residents who cast their
 
06:07:57.750 --> 06:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
right to vote in that election uh we
 
06:08:00.310 --> 06:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
were blessed here in New Hampshire that
 
06:08:03.110 --> 06:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
the weather was also unprecedented no
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
snow no rain that being said we had
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
lines in towns that required 2hour
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
weights and More in most cases if not
 
06:08:15.270 --> 06:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
all it was caused by too many people
 
06:08:17.590 --> 06:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
trying to cast their vote in one spot
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
one polling place this is a simple
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
change to the existing RSA
 
06:08:27.150 --> 06:08:27.160 align:start position:0%
658 uh semicon 10 presently it takes the
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
vote of the town to add or subtract
 
06:08:33.110 --> 06:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
polling places this simply allows that
 
06:08:35.548 --> 06:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
decision to be made by the Selectmen
 
06:08:36.750 --> 06:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
06:08:40.830 --> 06:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
May and not a shall but helps the voters
 
06:08:44.190 --> 06:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
in each town the people that we serve so
 
06:08:46.350 --> 06:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
for example for your town election if
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
you only needed one polling place that's
 
06:08:53.350 --> 06:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
not a problem but when we come up on an
 
06:08:56.590 --> 06:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
election every four years like we do
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
like we did this past November it might
 
06:09:02.350 --> 06:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
be in the best interest of the town to
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
create two polling places so that that
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
people are not in line for 2 and 1/2
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
hours then they can go back to their one
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
polling place I say this because I live
 
06:09:17.948 --> 06:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
in London area and our lines were 2 and
 
06:09:21.150 --> 06:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
1 half hours long they went down the
 
06:09:23.350 --> 06:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
down the parking lot up the parking lot
 
06:09:25.990 --> 06:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
around back to the other side and people
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
were waiting in line and I just think
 
06:09:32.230 --> 06:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
that this would be an easy fix that the
 
06:09:34.590 --> 06:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
towns may choose to do this type of
 
06:09:37.670 --> 06:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
thing with that I'll accept any qu
 
06:09:39.230 --> 06:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
questions you may have questions from
 
06:09:39.240 --> 06:09:40.350 align:start position:0%
questions you may have questions from
the

06:09:40.350 --> 06:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:09:42.670 --> 06:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
06:09:45.788 --> 06:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you for taking my question
 
06:09:48.750 --> 06:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I I don't I live in a city so we
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
have Wards and it's a little different
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
so and I know when we changed our Ward
 
06:10:00.350 --> 06:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
polling places two years ago it was and
 
06:10:02.628 --> 06:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
everybody got notice and everybody got a
 
06:10:05.590 --> 06:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
letter because and people showed up up
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
still at the wrong place right so I mean
 
06:10:14.468 --> 06:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
it sounds like 30 days is enough but
 
06:10:14.478 --> 06:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
it sounds like 30 days is enough but
um

06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
logistically what do we do with the
 
06:10:20.070 --> 06:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
people who inevitably are going to show
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
up at the wrong place particularly near
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
closing time so I'm just trying to
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
figure this out how that would all work
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
and the notice would work and and maybe
 
06:10:32.830 --> 06:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
you're not the right one to ask I don't
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
know well um thank you for your question
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
we know when the next election
 
06:10:41.070 --> 06:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
presidential election is we know when
 
06:10:42.868 --> 06:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
the next one is after that and after
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
that and after that um 30 days was an
 
06:10:48.468 --> 06:10:48.478 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number actually this
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislation was actually um um formed by
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
um secretary scandin who will speak next
 
06:10:59.628 --> 06:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure that he might be interested
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
I will ask him yes he might be
 
06:11:03.430 --> 06:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
interested in saying that we could do it
 
06:11:06.190 --> 06:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
a year in advance and mind people every
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
two weeks yeah okay thank you and he he
 
06:11:12.510 --> 06:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
is the only one signed up to speak so um
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
any other question question Nome thank
 
06:11:16.590 --> 06:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
you very much thanks for taking the
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
question uh in your testimony you
 
06:11:20.270 --> 06:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned the possibility for the big
 
06:11:22.510 --> 06:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
elections going to multiples and then
 
06:11:25.788 --> 06:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
going back does this change allow to go
 
06:11:28.468 --> 06:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
back and how would then the same notice
 
06:11:30.270 --> 06:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
requirements to go back yes and wouldn't
 
06:11:32.788 --> 06:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
that just add to
 
06:11:35.310 --> 06:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
confusion well I live in londondary and
 
06:11:39.310 --> 06:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 18,000 people we
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
have a news we're fortunate we have a
 
06:11:42.270 --> 06:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
newspaper that goes out every single
 
06:11:44.190 --> 06:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
week to every single residents in the
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
town um you know I think we need to
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
think about the the voters and the
 
06:11:53.390 --> 06:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
convenience of the voters I mean we had
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
elderly and I use the
 
06:11:59.788 --> 06:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
term um that waited in line for two 2
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
and a half hours there was no they did
 
06:12:05.628 --> 06:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
did allow um people with small children
 
06:12:09.390 --> 06:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
to go ahead but many of the PE my I live
 
06:12:11.948 --> 06:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
in a 55 community they wouldn't go ahead
 
06:12:14.190 --> 06:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
in line because they just felt that they
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
needed to be there I think this would
 
06:12:19.628 --> 06:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
help also I think people are going to I
 
06:12:22.750 --> 06:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
think people walked away from voting not
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
only because of the lines but because of
 
06:12:28.468 --> 06:12:28.478 align:start position:0%
the traffic to get there if you have to
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
go to work and you think you're going to
 
06:12:32.468 --> 06:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
show up at the polls at 6:00 a.m. to
 
06:12:36.270 --> 06:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
make it even to 8:00 or 9:00 being at
 
06:12:39.070 --> 06:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
work some people were not able to do
 
06:12:39.080 --> 06:12:43.468 align:start position:0%
work some people were not able to do
that

06:12:43.468 --> 06:12:43.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:45.788 --> 06:12:45.798 align:start position:0%
so all right uh further questions from
 
06:12:48.990 --> 06:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
the committee see n uh thank you for
 
06:12:51.868 --> 06:12:51.878 align:start position:0%
filing this um just this is a serious
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
problem and we are going to look heavily
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is a serious problem thank
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
you uh last up and the last card of the
 
06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
day iron perfect enough repres
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative godo he was a
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
representative at one point point at one
 
06:13:09.468 --> 06:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
point uh secretary scalin
 
06:13:12.910 --> 06:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
honorable well let's not go that
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
far thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
06:13:17.310 --> 06:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'll try and choose my
 
06:13:17.320 --> 06:13:19.468 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'll try and choose my
words

06:13:19.468 --> 06:13:19.478 align:start position:0%
words
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh carefully this um I would like to
 
06:13:25.230 --> 06:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
thank representative Perez for
 
06:13:28.628 --> 06:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
introducing this piece of legislation it
 
06:13:30.430 --> 06:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
is similar to one that was heard in the
 
06:13:33.310 --> 06:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
Senate today although significant
 
06:13:37.030 --> 06:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
variations but it addressed is the issue
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
of really high voter turnout uh which is
 
06:13:42.548 --> 06:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
a great thing and New Hampshire
 
06:13:45.190 --> 06:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
consistently turns out record numbers of
 
06:13:48.150 --> 06:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
Voters but because the state is growing
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the polling the number of polling
 
06:13:53.310 --> 06:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
places really hasn't increased uh we are
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
seeing lines that we would never have
 
06:13:59.628 --> 06:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
seen you know 20 years ago uh and in the
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
last election the lines were long uh you
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
know some were an hour some were two
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
hours and there were a few that were
 
06:14:09.868 --> 06:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
even longer than that and um that's not
 
06:14:11.788 --> 06:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
fair to the voters so there are these
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
tools that we can put in place to help
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
address those issues one is uh creating
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for towns to easily have
 
06:14:23.070 --> 06:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
additional polling places so that they
 
06:14:26.468 --> 06:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
can spread the voters out uh uh over
 
06:14:28.670 --> 06:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
different sites um I think it's
 
06:14:30.788 --> 06:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
important to note that this bill and the
 
06:14:33.628 --> 06:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
one this morning is not directed at a
 
06:14:35.390 --> 06:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
specific town or group of towns towns I
 
06:14:37.670 --> 06:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
can tell you that the largest towns in
 
06:14:39.150 --> 06:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
this state run
 
06:14:41.430 --> 06:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly uh efficient
 
06:14:44.310 --> 06:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
elections and um you you heard from them
 
06:14:46.670 --> 06:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
earlier today New Hampshire does have
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
the distinction of having the smallest
 
06:14:50.270 --> 06:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
polling places in the country and it
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
also has the largest and that's a neat
 
06:14:55.150 --> 06:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
distinction to have as long as you know
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
everything runs smoothly and and so you
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
know I want to make sure that if a
 
06:15:01.510 --> 06:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
community is up for it and they plan
 
06:15:03.788 --> 06:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
well enough that they can continue to do
 
06:15:05.948 --> 06:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
that but there are other towns in the
 
06:15:07.868 --> 06:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
state that struggle and so in addition
 
06:15:10.910 --> 06:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
to additional polling places you we can
 
06:15:13.030 --> 06:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
do more training we're always doing
 
06:15:15.070 --> 06:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
training but help moderators and
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
election officials identify the choke
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
points in a polling place so that things
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
can move technology will help out making
 
06:15:24.190 --> 06:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
sure that you we have enough ballot
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
counting devices in the towns that use
 
06:15:28.270 --> 06:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
them in towns that use e Pole books
 
06:15:30.190 --> 06:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have appropriate
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of those um but clearly this is
 
06:15:35.628 --> 06:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
an area that we have to look at
 
06:15:37.390 --> 06:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
for the future and with that I'd be
 
06:15:39.430 --> 06:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions other
 
06:15:43.390 --> 06:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent C
 
06:15:45.548 --> 06:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
I'll go the ranking Member First it's
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
okay take somebody else all right okay
 
06:15:51.230 --> 06:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
btis thank you for taking questions and
 
06:15:53.788 --> 06:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
it's similar I just want want to make
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
sure you're confident that this language
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
would be able for them then to pull back
 
06:16:02.030 --> 06:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
and go back to what they had for the
 
06:16:06.110 --> 06:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
non um not the small elections the local
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
elections those kind of things you're
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
that they'll be able to do that with
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.468 --> 06:16:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
it is that okay repres
 
06:16:27.788 --> 06:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:16:30.788 --> 06:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking my question um Can
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
the electronic Pole books be coordinated
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
from two different locations so if
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody shows up at the wrong location
 
06:16:39.310 --> 06:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
that they can still vote because within
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
a town the ballot should all be the
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
same they could probably be set up for
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I that's something that I think I
 
06:16:48.628 --> 06:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
would oppose and typically when an
 
06:16:51.190 --> 06:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
additional polling place is set up it is
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
set up
 
06:16:54.830 --> 06:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
for a distinct group of Voters that will
 
06:16:57.190 --> 06:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
be assigned that polling place and so I
 
06:16:58.628 --> 06:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
mean that does come to the other issue
 
06:17:01.270 --> 06:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
that you raised communication will be a
 
06:17:03.310 --> 06:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
really really important part of this
 
06:17:05.070 --> 06:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
getting the word out you know
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
fortunately with technology it's easier
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
to do that today than it was 20 years
 
06:17:08.638 --> 06:17:10.750 align:start position:0%
to do that today than it was 20 years
ago

06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:17:13.750 --> 06:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
but representative we yeah uh just a
 
06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question would this give the
 
06:17:18.110 --> 06:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist enough time
 
06:17:20.990 --> 06:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
to sort into multiple polling places if
 
06:17:23.590 --> 06:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's only 30
 
06:17:26.070 --> 06:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
days I I think it can be done because of
 
06:17:28.430 --> 06:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
the way the database is set up however I
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
I think 30 days is kind of tight I I
 
06:17:33.628 --> 06:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
would be okay you know making it 60 or
 
06:17:35.628 --> 06:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
90 we know when the big elections are
 
06:17:37.670 --> 06:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen so there's plenty of
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
time to gear up for
 
06:17:41.948 --> 06:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
it further
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions represent PR O'Brien I
 
06:17:46.230 --> 06:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
apologize if this has already been asked
 
06:17:49.230 --> 06:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
but with the electronic poll books if
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
you know in my community that's what's
 
06:17:53.310 --> 06:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
used maybe some other
 
06:17:55.350 --> 06:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
speakers other guests that are here
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
could speak to this but would there be
 
06:18:00.750 --> 06:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
communication between the two polling
 
06:18:03.990 --> 06:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
places with the electronic poll books so
 
06:18:05.708 --> 06:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
conceivably somebody could go to one
 
06:18:07.390 --> 06:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
polling place vote and then go to
 
06:18:10.190 --> 06:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
another polling place and no
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay each polling place that the poll
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
books would have the checklist for that
 
06:18:17.788 --> 06:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
06:18:22.190 --> 06:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
y further question from the committee um
 
06:18:23.548 --> 06:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
that's it all right well I I'll end with
 
06:18:26.910 --> 06:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
this one um does your office recognize
 
06:18:29.190 --> 06:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
that these lines are an issue you know I
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
think Bedford had one that was like an
 
06:18:33.190 --> 06:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
hour and a half um I know I waited in
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
wear like tiny little town of wear for
 
06:18:37.628 --> 06:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
almost an hour
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an issue and I'm hoping
 
06:18:41.548 --> 06:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
your office I guess what I'm looking for
 
06:18:43.150 --> 06:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
is the rhetorical question of does your
 
06:18:44.510 --> 06:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
office recognize this as an issue and
 
06:18:46.510 --> 06:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
that we need I believe we need to do
 
06:18:48.750 --> 06:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
something agree with that 100% the
 
06:18:51.548 --> 06:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
answer is yes okay all right thank you
 
06:18:53.830 --> 06:18:53.840 align:start position:0%

06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%

06:19:00.590 --> 06:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
person signed up uh in person on the
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
blue sheet that did not speak online it
 
06:19:05.868 --> 06:19:05.878 align:start position:0%

06:19:08.430 --> 06:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
