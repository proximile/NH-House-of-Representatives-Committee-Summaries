in election law when we start at 10 we
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
start at 10 but you know
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
speaks to your leadership pretty close
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
no um uh good morning everyone my name
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
is uh Ross Bay represent uh Hillsborough
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
39 South Manchester Ward's uh six eight
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
and nine I have about 30 000
 
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.969 align:start position:0%
and nine I have about 30 000
constituents

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I I bring that up uh because today I
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
bring forward a bill to remove the state
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
representative duties on the county
 
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.189 align:start position:0%
representative duties on the county
delegation

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh where this came out from
 
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh where this came out from
was

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
um a set last year I sat on the
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
um uh and one of the things that kept
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
coming up entirely is you can't make
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
State Rep districts cross county lines
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
um because we are all on our County
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
delegation duties
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
um and that kind of like spurred my
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts of like well why are we doing
 
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
thoughts of like well why are we doing
that

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
um it's not to change the maps it's like
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
why are we doing that and when I started
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
talking to other counties I found out
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
that there's actually for model Russ
 
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
probably won't admit this but there's
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
actually a lot of people don't even want
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
to do it there are counties that imprint
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
during my investigation who shall remain
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
nameless who actually have to call
 
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
around their members to make sure that
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
enough of us are there so they can have
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
a quorum to actually vote
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
um so you know it's one of those deals
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
of there's three divisions of government
 
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
there's local County and state New
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County government is
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
notoriously weak compared to how other
 
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
states run it um most other states
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
County government is actually extremely
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
powerful they do everything schools
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
um uh full policing that sort of deal as
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
you guys know in New Hampshire counties
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
are basically relegated to long-term
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
care the nursing homes the court systems
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the county jail or Sheriff
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so in kind of exploring all of this
 
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
it was a one of those intellectual
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
exercises that I wanted to have of why
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
are we doing this is it appropriate that
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
we're doing this and I'll talk about
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
that in just a second and should we
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
continue doing it so the reason I ask
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
the reason I raise the question is is it
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate so there's three branches of
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
government right state
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
County well it's for federal but we
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
don't deal with that uh state county and
 
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.129 align:start position:0%
don't deal with that uh state county and
local

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
we sit on both uh where state
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
representatives what we said on both uh
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
why don't we sit on the local why aren't
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
we also running the towns
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
we don't right it would be ludicrous if
 
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
we did right nobody would nobody here
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
would vote for that it's another Duty so
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
here we have this added Duty for this
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
branch of government that has very
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
little power
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and then on top of that we elect
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
these things called County Commissioners
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
so when I first kind of floated this
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
idea to people they said well who would
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
do the county delegation duties like
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
well what about the County Commissioners
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know the people we elect to you know
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
run the county
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to have this thought
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
exercise I I'm not uh I'm not sitting
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
here saying this must this must vote to
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
um there are some long-term concerns so
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
like let's take koas County they
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
currently have eight members of their
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
delegation if the demographic trends of
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
the state continue they will continue to
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
lose delegates or state representatives
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it will create a problem for them uh
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
probably won't create a problem for them
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
in 2030 but it might start creating a
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
problem for them in 2040. the trend line
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
continues they could be down uh in 30
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
years they could be down to two or three
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
state reps that are then running the
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
whole County so it's something that we
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to look at it today in terms
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
of a problem but looking down the road
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
there will be some issues and I know how
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
Concord works and I know when you're
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
doing something like this where it's a
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
fundamental shift you got to start that
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
conversation early so people are at
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
least thinking about it when it does
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
kind of when it does come time to make
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
that change so we're not just flying by
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
the seat of our pants so I'm sure there
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
will be some awesome questions about
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
this I hope and I'm more than happy to
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.269 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
yokella

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
yokella
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
the question so in um the uh
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
at the state at the local level there is
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the legislative branches the people
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
that elect the governing body like the
 
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.250 align:start position:0%
that elect the governing body like the
Selectmen

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
Selectmen
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
um and the governing body makes the
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
budget and then the the legislative body
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
actually votes for it
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
how do you see that
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
um happening at the county level if you
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminate the legislative
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
approval process of the budget of the
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
because you're voting in the the
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
governing body aka the Commissioners but
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
then there's they're creating the budget
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
and there's no kind of check
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the budget that they create yeah so
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
you can make that argument about state
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
government right we create a budget that
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
we pass in the state
 
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the we vote for County
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners let County Commissioners
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
do it the people vote right you're just
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're the districts are larger right
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
which is by the way another conversation
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that needs to take place if something
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
like this happens is most of these
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
Counties have three districts uh and by
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
the way there's a variety of how long
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
those terms are
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
um uh and how they elect those people so
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
like in Stratford County um there's no
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
districts they elect three County
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
Commissioners county-wide if I'm correct
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
um but in Hillsborough County we have
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
three districts that are elected
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
in districts and they serve two-year
 
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
terms in Rockingham County there's three
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
districts they serve four-year terms and
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
those terms are not all the same so
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
you'll have a two-year term and two
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
four-year terms so there needs to be
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
some uniformity in that
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
um it's definitely once again this is
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
the conversation that needs to take
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
place like would it be appropriate for
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
there to be you know like in other
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
states a uh like like a
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
um a person that's elected county-wide
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
is acts as a veto or almost like a mayor
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the county if you would
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
um it's just a question of how long are
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
we going to be able to keep doing this
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
how long is specifically kowas County
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to keep doing this
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
because what's their check there when
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
they go down to potentially two members
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
in 30 years what's going to be their
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
have you consulted with kowas County on
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
this matter I haven't spoken to them
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
directly um it's just one of those deals
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
of when exploring this I started to ask
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
like what happens next right like we
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
should do
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
um and I just know that the long-term
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
trends if the if the trends of the state
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
continue right where Southern New
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to grow
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
exponentially faster than Northern New
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this will become a problem for
 
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this will become a problem for
them

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um it may not be two in 30 years it
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
could be three and at that point they're
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
effectively County Commissioners right
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
because they'll have three districts and
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
there's three County Commissioners and
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
co-ops so I haven't spoke with them
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
directly but it will be as once again
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem now won't be a
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
problem in 2030 it probably won't be a
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
problem in 2040 but looking down the
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
road it will be a problem if we keep
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative chair 11.
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering if
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
during your research you spoke with
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
people who are legislators who didn't
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
realize that they were going to have a
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
delegation obligation for their to their
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
County as well adding to their workload
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
yeah um I I did um and thank you for
 
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because I missed
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
something in my opening remarks
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
um which is a lot of people don't
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
realize they have to go do this right um
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
and going back to it there are counties
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
where their chairmen have to call
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
through and beg people show up not
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
begging them to show up like how to vote
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
right like when we with votes on our
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
respective sides right we say please
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
show up and vote you know A or B uh
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
please show up so they can vote so
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think any I don't think
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
they'd ever whisper the words in public
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
right because no one wants to see like I
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to do my job but there are a
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
lot of them that a didn't know they had
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
to do that job and B don't want to do it
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
um conversely um there are people
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
amongst our 400 members who love it uh
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not one of them just to be honest
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but there are some that that
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely love it uh they like getting
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
the mileage and some counties do a per
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
diem reimbursement uh I I kind of look
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
at it as like every time I come to
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
Concord I'm losing money
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm also self-employed knowing a
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
business and so there's there's
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
definitely a variety of ways to look at
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
it um I would say anybody who's like
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
using that line of reasoning to keep
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
this around should probably
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
like reconsider um if anybody here is
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
doing this for the money please tell me
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
how you're making that work because I'd
 
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
love to know
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of getting more people
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
to run right we're always talking about
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
getting trying to get more people
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
younger people to run
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
um removing this what I view is kind of
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary Duty
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
um could open that up just a little more
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not under delusions that if you take
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
away this that all of a sudden you know
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
every 20 and 30 year old in the state's
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
gonna start running for State Rep but
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those things that you
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
can take away and make it a little
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
easier thank you for your answer
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
um so about the point about cost
 
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.230 align:start position:0%
um so about the point about cost
counties

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:52.820 align:start position:0%
declining population
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just wondering
 
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.230 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just wondering
uh

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
why we have to accept that that trend
 
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:04.700 align:start position:0%
line is going to continue why can't we
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
instead Institute policies to encourage
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
more movement to koas County so that
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
their population doesn't decline as much
 
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:18.139 align:start position:0%
and that they maintain a
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
similarly size delegation
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
I think kowas county has been working on
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
that for as long as co-host county has
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
been around so
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe that's directly
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
related to this bill
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know growing the North Country
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
something I'm sure that they want to do
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
but it's the reality of the situation is
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
is if the trend line continues
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's nothing indicating that it's
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to change kovid would have been
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
the greatest impetus for change where
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
people could move and work remotely and
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
they still are having that problem so
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's a this bill is not targeting co-ops
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
let me be very clear there's just
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
another piece of the puzzle of this the
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
point of this is why are state
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
representatives doing County work when
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative majority thank you Mr
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question on on the bill uh
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
page three lines 24 and 25 and if
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't have it it's it's with
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
regard to the oath that we take I I
 
00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:17.779 align:start position:0%
think I'm understanding then you you
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
suggested they're striking the line
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
which says that they shall That We Shall
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
Serve in that capacity
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
can I is it correct then to say that
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
they may if if they would like you're
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
not are you suggesting that they will
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
not serve or that they may serve my
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
intention is that they may not um that
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
they would not serve would not would not
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
serve okay um it needs to be one of the
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
things that does bother me about our
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
County government across the state in
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
general is that's not uniform this bill
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix that problem obviously uh
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know if I was going through I would
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
mandate that they probably have five
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner districts uh and
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
that they'd be elected every two years
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
like every other branch of government in
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
the state is a exception of Mayors
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the features of New
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh uh the democratically
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
elected Republican New Hampshire
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um is that we our voters have the
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change us out every
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
single two years
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
um you don't have that opportunity in
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners but once again
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's not in this bill uh but one of
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
the things I would like is it to be
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
uniform uh in the future for all but
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's not a that's a that's a you guys
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
problem and not not the spill problem
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me thank you Mr
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
representative Barry do you have an idea
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
of how long New Hampshire has had the
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
tradition of having us fulfill this role
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's been from the
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
beginning so once again like I don't I
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand how conquer works and I
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
understand changing things that have
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
been the way they always have been it's
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
like uh you know you get laughed at the
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
first time you do it but then people
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
start thinking about it and they're like
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute there's there is
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me the issue you're
 
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:00.500 align:start position:0%
saying you're having difficulty
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
retaining people to do the work or it's
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
just too challenging because they're
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
busy rather than advocating your
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
financial oversight would you instead
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
just say why don't we allow remote
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
participation via zoom and make it
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
easier for the legislator to actually
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
participate no I still find it
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
inappropriate on a on a purely divisions
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
of government level I still find it
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that people that are
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
elected for State office are managing
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
County government once again it will
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
nobody here would suggest for a minute
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
that state officers should be
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
managing municipal government it's the
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
same those are different divisions right
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so the absurdity of that should be
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
applied to the absurdity of us running
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things that troubles me about
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is Throughout the chapter we talk
 
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
about executive committees and uh
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and if you have a
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
three-person convention you're dividing
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
up all that work between the three
 
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.029 align:start position:0%
up all that work between the three
people

00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
people
correct

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
um so one of the reasons that the bill
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
has an implementation date of 2031 uh is
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh 2032 excuse me is to find those
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
problems and fix them because whenever
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
this changes have this change probably
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
won't happen this year I'm not
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
delusional this change will probably
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
happen in 10 or 20 years so the reason
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
I've put it into 2032 is to find those
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
problems and fix them that would give us
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
I would hope that in nine years we could
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know smoothly launch the ship
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Mary thank you guys this
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
is Lively I enjoyed it
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
next we will I only have one other pink
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
cards anybody else who's wishing to
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
speak make sure you have one uh
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I'm
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horrigan from
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
Stratford County district 10. and I am
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a long time member of the Stratford
 
00:19:23.169 --> 00:19:23.179 align:start position:0%
county executive committee in fact the
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
county duty is one of my favorite parts
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
of the job
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
although sometimes we'll have a
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
relatively short meeting that goes
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
smoothly and I'll have actually made
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
something approaching a living wage for
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
like going in a meeting for 45 minutes
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
in our hour at the courthouse and I do
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes feel a little bit like that's
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
probably repugnant to some members of
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
this body but even I think that's a
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
little weird but we also have other
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
County meetings that go on for hours and
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
hours and you know we're paid
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
essentially nothing for it um Stratford
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
County's County government medium-sized
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
County which probably helps some of the
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
issues and we've had uh you know fairly
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
good leadership from both parties and of
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
course as you know Mr chair you're an
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
active participant in County government
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
yourself and that's maybe not been the
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
mistake in some other counties they had
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
like a lot of problems in Belknap County
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
just be partially just because of a
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair and I mean that was who the people
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
that was who the representative chose
 
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.100 align:start position:0%
but he was took some questionable uh
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
questionable positions some of which
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
proved to be extremely unpopular so that
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
was and you know so he's not even in the
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
legislature anymore but um
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
most of the counties uh the county
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
commit delegations are fairly stable
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
body and there's veteran members who
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
serve for many terms and get to know the
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
County government
 
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
County government
um intimately

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
um intimately
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
um so I I think the county delegation
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
has a separate role from the County
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioners although the lines a
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
little bit blurred the County
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are uh are uh you know
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're the executive branch of
 
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
the County government and the county
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
delegation the legislative branch and I
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
think we should keep those uh I think
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
it's good to keep those separate um
 
00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:00.289 align:start position:0%
it's good to keep those separate um
the

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
the other the other issue is and
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Barry did of course I
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill very strange bills
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
weren't the angle behind it was because
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
there's uh so part of it is the county
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
commissions are three members which I
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
guess has some advantages in terms of
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
the coherence of the group it's
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're either unanimous or you're two
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
against one so it was pretty clear like
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
what the decision is um but that
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
probably is kind of a small group even
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
to do with the County Commissioners
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
already do and then if we're dumping
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
this much in the workload then that gets
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
even more unworkable and uh
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be a terrible idea
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
of that five Commissioners or seven and
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean if you have a separate bill to
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
do that I would be supportive of it I
 
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support any fundamental changes
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
with structure County government which I
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
think is I think is good um
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
the revenue also wrote the question of
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
coax County and I've often wondered
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
about that I could even imagine it would
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
be after our time but like when there's
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
they're only entitled to one member um
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of legislative
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
who might need a constitutional fix one
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
might be simply
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
to merge koas County with a neighboring
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
County probably Grafton would be the
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
most obvious choice although Grafton
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
county is already like a pretty large
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
area as it is and
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
um you could still keep the county as
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
you know as a sort of a paper entity for
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
the purposes of Statistics because you
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
know subdividing emerging counties Great
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
Soul college for all kinds of programs
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
because we have all kinds of data
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
especially the federal level that is
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
collected by County but that's
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
not really an argument in favor of this
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
bill you have to call us County
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
delegation gets to be so small that it's
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
hard to get them to get together to meet
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
um the social might be just to you know
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
merged to co-host and Grafton County
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
delegations and have that group
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
administer the whole whole area or
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
Carroll County as the case may be
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
many other states have done that have
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
emerged counties like in Massachusetts
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
effectively most of the counties you
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
know in Eastern Massachusetts exist only
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
on existently on paper or at least only
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
have certain departments done by county
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
and that can be done here here in New
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but um I almost think some of
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
our Hillsborough Rockingham are kind of
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
unwielding the other direction although
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
I've sometimes thought about subdividing
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
the counties in some way but there's no
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
support for that and that would you know
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
create more problems than it solved so I
 
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.310 align:start position:0%
create more problems than it solved so I
would

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
basically say you know there may be
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
issues with some County delegations but
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
fight from co-ops those aren't
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
structural problems so it's it's
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
if things don't go well in the county
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's probably just sort of the function
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
of uh you know what happens in any
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
political unit sometimes we do our work
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
smoothly and as we've done in crap uh
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
Stratford County throughout the entire
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
time I've served I'm in my eighth term
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
and some other counties not so well but
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating the county delegation
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
altogether is a good idea a mess for
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
the issue of municipalities I I just
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
sort of think Mission College have a
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat different legal status in
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
counties these counties are created by
 
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.510 align:start position:0%
counties these counties are created by
uh

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know the created by state government
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
the county delegations legislative
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
powers are limited a lot of things are
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
done at the state level so you know it's
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
within the counties the county can
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
simply uh if the county and the state of
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
course you know those are created in
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
statute by the uh by the law we can
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
certainly as I said marriage counties or
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
subdivided counties if we wanted to
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and the legislative districts I'm
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
this issue came up in uh 2012 for some
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason the 2010 redistricting My Town
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
manager and I guess his counterpart in
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
New Market somehow seemed to heard a
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
rumor that they're gonna they wanted to
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
merge us into one state legislative
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
district which
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
was problematic because we'd never done
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
it that way and we're crossing county
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
lines and as far as I can tell
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the law that actually
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
forbid State Rep districts from Crossing
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
county lines it's just it's a bad idea
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a little ambiguity about
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
which county delegation
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
the member would would belong to but
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
presumably he or she could would
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
probably go to the County's delegation
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
for their own Community even though some
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
of their constituents are on the other
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
side of the County Line and there are
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually some functions where the
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
Senators have a say appointing certain
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
officials and actually all the Senators
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
whose districts going to Stratford
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
County occasionally are invited to join
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
the County Convention for certain types
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
of appointments but
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
such as the peas trade ports so that's
 
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.850 align:start position:0%
such as the peas trade ports so that's
um

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
so I just say this is like aside from
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
possibly increasing the number of County
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and making it uniform
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um this bill is not needed and of course
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
the chaos with all the different
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh ways of redistricting uh County
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioners was created by the
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislature I think
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think strap I think the law for
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is a way to go on at
 
00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:47.870 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is a way to go on at
Large

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
Large
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
a multi-member at large district for the
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
whole County serving two years I think
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you I assume uh by
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
your discussion that you oppose the bill
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
oppose yes did I check off the right box
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're at six out uh six minutes and 40
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
seconds okay well they wrap it up there
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I said once before the
 
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.549 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I said once before the
representative

00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you all right thank
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
you thanks thanks

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
that at the 2022 state general election
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
and in each subsequent state general
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
election May
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
such offer and record as such officers
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham County shall be chosen in
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
the county by the voters for a four-year
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
term and provided that at the 2024 state
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
general election and at each subsequent
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
state general election any such officer
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
in Belknap County shall be chosen in the
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
county by the voters for a four-year
 
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.490 align:start position:0%
county by the voters for a four-year
term

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of straightforward it seems
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
every two years these positions are a
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan position and therefore they
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
are uh re
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
as it's currently set up they're
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
required to run every two years so as
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
they are elected to their position they
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
get a reprieve for about six months
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a year and then they attention are
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
being drawn back into getting reelected
 
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:21.889 align:start position:0%
being drawn back into getting reelected
um

00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
so therefore it seems like it would make
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
sense since it's a nonpartisan
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
non-political type jobs that they
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
perform that their terms should be every
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
four years which then the electors have
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
a choice of keeping them if they're
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
doing a good job are
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
picking someone else to do the job
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
that's basically it
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.630 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
um do you see the election as
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
um oversight and
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
and what would the reason for La uh
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
reducing oversight over
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
um these positions
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
um be uh warranted you know reduced even
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
more than the governor or state reps or
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
any other position
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
why do they need less oversight
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question a lot of
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
these positions that are are talked
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
about matter of fact all of them are run
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
by uh rsas and stuff their duties are
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
are set forth by state legislation they
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
don't set up the state legislation they
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
have to abide by what the legislative
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
body uh tells them how they should be
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
able to do their job so therefore they
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
are not making political decisions that
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
every two years can change as the people
 
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.010 align:start position:0%
every two years can change as the people
uh

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
are in disagreement with the political
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
views are are not they do not make those
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
political choices so that oversight is
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
basically how they're performing to the
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislative duties that are set forth by
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh the head representative Manchester
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Joe thank you
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
this is exclusively for Sullivan County
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
belnap sorry Belknap County
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
and by changing the RSA at the state
 
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
and by changing the RSA at the state
level

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this impact the other counties
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
and do you how how do you
 
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
justify or how can we say Car World just
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it's already been set
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
up in another County so that that does
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that reference of
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County so it's already been set
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
forth and and currently
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
being done
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
so it would not be set in precedence for
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
any of the other counties as it may lead
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
them to make different directions and
 
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
how their County elections are ran and
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
stuff as far as these positions I cannot
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
say but for the positions here in
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
Belknap County they would like to see it
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:46.970 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
would you consider those positions to be
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
more of a professional situation because
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
they all have staff that may be turned
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
over every two years and the continuity
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
of the work may change
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question and I
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
think you you've hit another Point uh
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
that these are
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
like you said staff positions and stuff
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
there staffed by professionals and it
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
would help and improve the continuity
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
with their staffs and stuff as they see
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
the turnover every two years it's hard
 
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
to see how office policies and and and
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
just as soon as you get to learn who is
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
the head of that department they have a
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of being changed out so you
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
would have that inconsistency going
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
through whereas if you gave them four
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
years it would would provide that
 
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.690 align:start position:0%
years it would would provide that
continuity

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
continuity
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh between the staff and
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
the director thank you
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:57.380 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you representative
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
simple question why four years
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
it seems like the uh a good term where a
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
lot of offices have been changed over
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
across they use that to Senators
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
themselves use the six years if you look
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal it's a six year and if
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
you look at the House of Representatives
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's two if you look at a lot of your uh
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh uh States and stuff
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
four years seems to be the right amount
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
of time for someone to prove they're
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
either worthy of doing the job or
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
and that way you don't say six years and
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
then you're tied up
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
with someone who you really want to get
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
changed out before
 
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.129 align:start position:0%
changed out before
okay

00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah during representative manipuri's
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
question uh it came up the question of
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
other counties um
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
doing similar things and I believe the
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
county happened with
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
um previously was actually Rockingham
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
County where we had a bill not Sullivan
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
County which were is just on our mind
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
due to having a lot of other bills about
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County but anyways
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
um so with the bill for Rockingham
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
County's officers to go to four years
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
last term we actually changed that
 
00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:33.619 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
apply to All Counties last term in our
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee but then the rest of the house
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
decided to pull that from the consent
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
calendar and switch it back to being
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
just Rockingham County so I'm kind of
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
wondering why didn't
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
um Belknap County involved itself in
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
last term when
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
we had a chance
 
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
to include them in the counties that
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:14.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is my first term as
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
from the previous bill they had
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned Belknap County had some
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
challenges that was going through with
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
their delegation and their
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
representatives and stuff and uh
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
the voters had spoke their uh opinion at
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
The Ballot Box and there were
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
Replacements put in place for the
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
representatives uh in Belknap County so
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest with you I don't
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you as why they did
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
not help support
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
what you that build
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
in the previous legislation
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so
 
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
historically in Belknap County
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
the offices that would be affected by
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill are the races for these County
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
positions typically contested or
 
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.870 align:start position:0%
positions typically contested or
uncontested

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
I do believe out of the four or five
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
that are being listed uh have not been
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
contested in years it has been this the
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
same people in place and the only
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
position that has really been contested
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
has been the sheriff's department uh are
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.030 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
I've seen several of these bills come
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
through that's earmarked
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
or one County or the other
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
being that
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
the legislature
um

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
votes for
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
everybody else's uh
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations I guess you'd call
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
them that why why just
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
why isn't it being converted to
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
the way County governments are on
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
in in one so they're having other other
 
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.050 align:start position:0%
in in one so they're having other other
counties

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
operate differently than
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know we're passing legislation for
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
Warren County rather than
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
um as I can't speak for the rest of the
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and how each of
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
those counties do want to run their
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
County governments uh
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
as observing what happened in Rockingham
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
County where the house
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
I guess Stripped Away and made it just
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
for Rockingham County
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
to re-fight that battle when you're
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
trying to just achieve something at your
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
local level uh
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
seems that it wouldn't pass again
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
so you would go ahead and and just
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
shortcom all of that and go straight for
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
the beef and and do Belknap County and
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
go from there if other states I mean
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
other counties wish to join in on it and
 
00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:37.790 align:start position:0%
other counties wish to join in on it and
stuff

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think there would be any uh
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
opposition to them joining the bill or
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
anything like that but at this point in
 
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.140 align:start position:0%
time to uh based on history
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
Belknap County would be standing alone
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative Galaga
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so kind of
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up to my previous
 
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.349 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up to my previous
question

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so he brought up
 
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
um so he brought up
um

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
the issues that
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
um Belknap County faced last term but
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
um if I remember correctly
 
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
um if I remember correctly
um

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
what wasn't it the case that
 
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.010 align:start position:0%
what wasn't it the case that
um

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
the county delegation was trying to
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
Short Circuit the process and
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
um like I I didn't think it was an issue
 
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.290 align:start position:0%
um like I I didn't think it was an issue
of

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
County of anything having to do with the
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
elections like they would they they'd
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
still be able to
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
do the same things
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
they did if the County Commissioners had
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what your question is
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you there's further questions
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%

dodging the speaker there thanks for
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.490 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
is there a problem with the text on line
 
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.230 align:start position:0%
is there a problem with the text on line
five

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
just for clarification I believe that's
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.859 --> 00:41:45.970 align:start position:0%
 
didn't

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:45.980 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be changed
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's not the subject of this bill the
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
subject of this bill is Belknap wants to
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
add their name to the list of
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
four term
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
kind of like Rockingham did
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher well so to kind
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:12.970 align:start position:0%
of follow up on

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:12.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles's question
 
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.690 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles's question
um

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
like wouldn't it be simpler to just
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
put the
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Bell nap directly after rocking him so
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
it says any such officer in Rockingham
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
or Belknap counties rather than
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
inserting an entirely separately
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
new sentence
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
for Belknap County
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I can't we
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
can't we compress things a little bit
 
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.890 align:start position:0%
can't we compress things a little bit
here

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
you could certainly compress things but
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think the change in the language
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
would change the outcome of the bill
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as it is stated now the
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
what balnap county is looking for is
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
just to set it up that way and this
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be the simplest way for us to
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
achieve that goal
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a little bit of
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question to my previous
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
question and so for these offices
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to primaries
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
were they all I assumed that they were
 
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
also uncontested in an additional
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
question is were there any of these
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
offices in which there was a single
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
candidate that ran on on both sides
 
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'll answer that question with the best
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge I don't
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
 
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.750 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
um

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney the County Treasurer
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds and the register
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
probate uh
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think they've had and mind you
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge anybody run
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
against them in a primary and in some
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
cases I've noticed on the ballot
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
themselves where they were on both sides
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
of the ballot because they are
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan race so it gives them the
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be there the Sheriff's
 
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.650 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be there the Sheriff's
Department

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
they did have Challengers or or whatnot
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
for that
so

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much seeing no more
 
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn the hearing over to
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative power to chair I have to
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:13.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
next I would like to call Sheriff Bill
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Wright to the witness stand to provide
 
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:32.569 align:start position:0%
Wright to the witness stand to provide
testimony

Madam chair and members of the committee

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
Bill Wright I've spent 25 years as a law
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer here in the state of
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'm currently the sheriff of Belknap
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
County and I'm in my second term I'm
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
here today in support of House Bill 357
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
I've worked for Belknap County Sheriff's
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
Office since July of 2005. I've been
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
employed by three separate sheriffs
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
where each one of those sheriffs had
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
served multiple terms and had to
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
as the sheriff of Belknap County I'm
 
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
expected to be a full-time employee
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm expected to answer to my
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
constituents uh every single day with
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
literally no days off so
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
knowing that I was elected into this
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
office as the sheriff
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
and knowing that I do answer to these
 
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.589 align:start position:0%
and knowing that I do answer to these
people

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
I knew that when I got into this
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
position I was going to start making
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
some change within my agency
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
some of the institutional changes that
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the constituents wanted to have happen
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
I knew that making those cultural
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
changes within the agency were going to
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
potentially uh cause an issue with my
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
current employees that were there that
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
were hired several sheriffs before me
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
and I also knew that with a change in
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
times we had to make these changes
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
within the agency
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that there's a two-year election
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
cycle for the Sheriff's Office
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
that that them changes were going to end
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
up causing a risk for me for potential
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh being ousted at some point
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
the same goes for like the County
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney the register of deeds
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
and uh the other County offices that are
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh listed in this bill
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
anytime that we took office we had to
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
start learning how to do our job in that
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
specific uh function being the sheriff
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
for Belknap county has been completely
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
different than when I was a deputy when
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
I was a sergeant and when I was being
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
mentored by the outgoing Sheriff before
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
I took office it's a completely
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
different animal it took me a
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time to learn how
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
to do my job who
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
who I report to how that all works uh
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
the different executive committee with
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
the delegation the delegation itself as
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
a whole body uh the commission local
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs being appointed to
 
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.250 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs being appointed to
different

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um commissions uh the governors like I
 
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
currently serve on I'm on the uh
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission for the Humane
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
treatment animals
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm also on the e911 commission those
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
take time to learn what to do and how to
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
do it in a in a two-year term
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
those days get eaten up pretty fast so
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
once I started learning how to do this
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
job well I was already on the campaign
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
Trail as soon as I got elected because
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
two years is not a long time
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
no I know that representative Boger had
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
said that uh you know we have a six
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
month to a year reprieve perhaps well I
 
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
can tell you as soon as I was elected
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
sheriff in my first term the process
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
started all over again for me
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we're out there meeting with
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
our constituents and again learning the
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
job in in trying to be as effective as
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
now as changes happen
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
within the agency
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
we're faced with making decisions some
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
decisions were great decisions other
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
ones not so much so again there's that
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
learning curve
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
well 18 months into the job uh that's
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
when again the I became contested I have
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
run three campaigns and I've won two of
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
them and they were all primaries I I
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
have not had to um
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
have a second person on the ballot I've
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
been on the bat on both sides of the
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
ballot for this position uh twice so far
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
as a relation to to
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
um all right correction I was contested
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
on One race uh during a primary I lost a
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
primary and I was booted off the off the
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
ballot the second time uh I had a uh a
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
Democrat opponent so I I did go into a
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
general election for that
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
um and I was successful and then this
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
last uh race was
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
um a primary race and then I was put on
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
the ballot on both sides for the general
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
two years is just not long enough for us
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
to do our job effectively
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
um even though that in the past uh it's
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
been tradition here in the state to have
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
two-year election Cycles I believe that
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
six years the question came up as to why
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
don't we want longer well six years
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
might be a little too long uh for us to
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
get too comfortable in our job is my
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
opinion so
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
I think a four-year term gives us the
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make the changes that we
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
need to make we learn our job we become
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
part of the process that that we're
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
doing similar to me being here
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
testifying to you now
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
it just builds a better continuity we're
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
required to develop policy after every
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
Sheriff gets done in Chief of Police we
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
we all have to redevelop our policies we
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
look at how things are going
 
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:11.690 align:start position:0%
look at how things are going
um

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I I went to the National
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Institute which was held last
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
April down in Quantico at the FBI
 
00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:19.790 align:start position:0%
April down in Quantico at the FBI
Academy

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
I was the only Sheriff out of 25 from
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
across the country that had a two-year
 
00:51:25.859 --> 00:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
across the country that had a two-year
term

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
the rest either had four six or eight
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
year terms
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
out of that I became kind of the group
 
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.670 align:start position:0%
out of that I became kind of the group
study

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
um about how I was going to Institute
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
change and that it was going to be
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
problematic for my agency create uh this
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
problem with continuity and uh and that
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
I would be contested they they actually
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
predicted that I was going to be highly
 
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
contested during my next race just
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
because of the changes and that was
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately what I would like to see
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
um in that I'm most concerned with is a
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
four-year term here in Belknap County
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
um just like Rockingham County had done
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
it last year the committee had decided
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
to separate all the counties and that it
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
should be up to those individual
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
counties to come forward and ask to be a
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
move to a different term and I'm asking
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
for this to be found ought to pass
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to recognize Representatives
 
00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:29.150 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to recognize Representatives
Davis

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
um as my colleague stated a few minutes
 
00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:37.730 align:start position:0%
um as my colleague stated a few minutes
ago

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
after previous testimony the the bill
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
for Rockingham County came before this
 
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.510 align:start position:0%
for Rockingham County came before this
committee

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh we as a matter of custom we tend to
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
not look favorably on bills that affect
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
specific counties or specific entities
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
because it raises matters of fairness
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
for other counties in the entire state
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh and consequently for the people who
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
vote for those positions in decisions in
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
the entire State
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the legislature in its wisdom
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
um decided that that was not a good
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
approach but now here we are back again
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
trying to solve what is being stated to
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
us as an issue of it's tough to learn
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
your job in two years and then campaign
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
again I get that
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
um but that is the way it is why Belknap
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
County and not Sullivan County or
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
Grafton County you know what can you
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
speak to the fairness of requesting this
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
for your position and your colleagues
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
positions but not other similar
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
positions Statewide
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes I was actually uh with the sheriff's
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
Association at the time when when the
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
previous Bill uh was put forward in that
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County was uh successful on
 
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.770 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County was uh successful on
that

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
and part of that reasoning was it became
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
it came before this committee here
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
um it started out as a Rockingham County
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
Bill and then uh all the other counties
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
had jumped on board with it and it got
 
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.589 align:start position:0%
had jumped on board with it and it got
presented

00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
presented
at

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
this committee was in favor at that time
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the problem is is that
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
once it went to the
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe it went to the Senate and
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
the senate had weighed in on it and
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
there was a problem with one of the
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
counties that there was some distension
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
or opposition to to that specific County
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
not wanting to move forward with with
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
that as a relation to that
 
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.930 align:start position:0%
that as a relation to that
um

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
As Time moved on there was no consensus
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
that was going to be reached so it was
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
determined that they were going to
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
separate uh all the other counties out
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
of it because again we were the
 
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.190 align:start position:0%
of it because again we were the
afterthought

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
afterthought
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
um to it originally so they returned the
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
language back to the original bill that
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
was submitted and that was the bill that
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
so if to answer your question about uh
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
do we think it's fair or what have you
 
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:08.900 align:start position:0%
uh all the sheriffs across this state
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
were in favor of being on this original
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
Bill to have the terms move to four
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
years there was not a single Sheriff
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
that was against that now I only speak
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the sheriffs because those
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
are the folks that I predominantly
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
associate with
 
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
um in this
 
00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:28.450 align:start position:0%
um in this
manner

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you sheriff
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have two-part
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
question one is you made a mention about
 
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.809 align:start position:0%
question one is you made a mention about
being

00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
a democrat or a republican you didn't
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
mention Republican by name but you said
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
you had a democratic opponent earlier we
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
heard this is a non-partisan position so
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
why did that question of whether you're
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
a democrat or a republican rise
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
the second part is if all sheriffs all
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
County Sheriffs think this is a good one
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
how come it's still just Rockingham I
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
mean Belknap County Why didn't
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
you put that in as all counties
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
so let me let me answer the second one
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
first so ultimately the representatives
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
that are in my County decided to put
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward this bill because they followed
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of what happened in
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
in the committee last time around where
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
the bill got separated in that it was it
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
was stated to have each County
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
individually uh make a presentation so
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
the representatives that are in my
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
County agreed that this would be a good
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
idea for us to
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
um to put it in as it's a legislative
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
session now so that's why you see
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
Belknap County and not the other
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
counties because we've already been down
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
that road of trying to get everybody
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and that did not make it
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
through so now we're doing what
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
Rockingham did and asking individual
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question or the
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
first one you you talked about the
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
ballot the separation of the ballot so
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
this is a non-partisan uh position I
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
don't I honestly don't care what's next
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
to the last name that they have when I'm
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
doing my police services but the state
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
law requires us to run on the ballot uh
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
in a primary so at that point we have to
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision where we sit in our
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
political realm if you will
 
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.010 align:start position:0%
political realm if you will
so

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.109 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
so saying that I I did not get primary
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
because there were specific questions
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
about primaries and all that uh during
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
previous testimony uh I wanted to signal
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
that I was not primary during one of my
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns but I was challenged during
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
the uh General
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
any other questions will witness
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
 
00:58:23.339 --> 00:58:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
question

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
um going back to what I previously uh
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
questioned the previous person about uh
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
kind of oversight by the electorate
 
00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:37.010 align:start position:0%
kind of oversight by the electorate
um

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
if uh if the job is being done
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
adequately or appropriately
 
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
adequately or appropriately
um

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
there may not be a frequent turnover but
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
in the cases where the job is not being
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
performed adequately
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
why do you believe that the that the
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
the county position should be filled for
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
four years in an adequate in an
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
unadequate position in a unadequate
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
situation when we have the current
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change that over in two
 
00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
years if if it's not being handled
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately or maybe they're
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
instituting policies that are not
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
so in the area of
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
the Sheriff's Office
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
when I took office I started institution
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
instituting cultural change it's
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
something that previous sheriffs did not
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
do so we were operating based on 30
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
years ago the way that it ran because of
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
fear of
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
issues that might arise with with
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
employees or with the union or whatever
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's inside uh the operations of our
 
00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:53.630 align:start position:0%
that's inside uh the operations of our
agency

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
I was a person that when I campaigned
 
00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.170 align:start position:0%
I was a person that when I campaigned
originally

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
I said I was going to make the changes
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
that were that were necessary to bring
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
us up to today's date in time uh in what
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
I have been trained in
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
to be better
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
as soon as I started implementing those
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
changes that's when
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
we started seeing the disruption and if
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
you will the employment
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
so in two years anybody can pretty much
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
fake it first for 18 months and then
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
they can go and support another
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
candidate and hide behind that sign and
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
say anything that goes forward now is a
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
retaliatory issue which creates a
 
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
situation that
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
um is not necessarily favorable to our
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
constituents or the or the county itself
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
so a four-year term you cannot you those
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
who uh were on my staff and perhaps I
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
maybe turned my staff over when I first
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
came into office
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
choose my own number two uh my number
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
threes and so on and so forth
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
I have four years to implement my
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
changes four years to prove to the
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
constituents uh in those that I report
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
to you that the changes were made that
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
were they were effective and that my
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
leadership was effective
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
a two-year term does not allow that
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
because again
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
um if I wanted to keep this the office
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
status quo then I could probably not
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
have had any disruption at all
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
but I was a person of change I was a
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
person of progress so making that
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
progress creates that disruption
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you that having to uh
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
fight the second term for a second term
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh was very distracting to the internal
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
operations of the agency
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
even though that I'm doing my stuff
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
outside and away from the office it
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
still detracts from this job itself a
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
four-year term will show a demonstrated
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
ability in in actual changes cultural
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
changes are being made so I was not
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
afraid to make those changes and uh and
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
there's other sheriffs that are in the
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
sheriff for taking my question
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure this one can be answered
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
but if a bad guy is going to trial
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
can you give me an average for how long
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
it takes for that whole process from the
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
time that bad guy for something really
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
bad has been arrested to the time that
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that case has been fully adjudicated
 
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.210 align:start position:0%
that case has been fully adjudicated
takes

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
sure because the Sheriff's Office deals
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
with warrants and uh we see the the
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
transition of the cases I could tell you
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
you know just yesterday we had it we
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
cleared an arrest warrant that was a
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
case was over two years old
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be kind of a
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
traditional uh process though if you add
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
situations like the last pandemic where
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
the courts were closed for almost an
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
you start you know everything starts
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
stacking up and everything gets kind of
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
pushed uh to the back burner and uh due
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
process is slowed so you can say that
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's at least two years as a normal
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know year and a half two years
 
01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes even longer for these cases to
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow-up to that question
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
if that occurs and you're no longer
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
Sheriff can you still get called back to
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
testify in that case
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
sure if it's a case that I've had
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
involvement in I can be subpoenaed at
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
any point I would come in as a person a
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
civilian being served
 
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
um you know a subpoena to go in and
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
um one more question in terms of
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
process that it takes for a sheriff's
 
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.109 align:start position:0%
process that it takes for a sheriff's
County

01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:55.430 align:start position:0%
County
um

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
typical cases that sheriff department in
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
accounting handles what's the length of
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
processing the kind of cases that you
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
get as at the sheriff's level
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
that can vary I mean we because we're
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional we have the ability
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
to investigate crimes that occur in
 
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.010 align:start position:0%
to investigate crimes that occur in
multi-jurisdictions

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictions
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
so depending on the case they they could
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
go I mean you know I had a case that was
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
solved within an hour uh yesterday and
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
then uh you know one of my detectors
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
worked on and then we've had other cases
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
that we've been working on for three
 
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.010 align:start position:0%
that we've been working on for three
years

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
um you know we like our agency has been
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
tied tied into uh investigating some of
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
the uh sexual abuse cases from years ago
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh from some different communities in in
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
those sometimes take a significant
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time so the cases can last a
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time it all
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and evidence and whatever we
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
can get to bring it to closure
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair so if and
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's a multi-jured restriction in
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
different towns and cities are involved
 
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.109 align:start position:0%
different towns and cities are involved
so

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
is it more complicated longer if it has
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
you have to work with the local police
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
departments for example if it's a
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County but you know then
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
have to work with the Nashua Police
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
Department so would that be longer if
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
you have to collaborate with other
 
01:05:31.319 --> 01:05:33.530 align:start position:0%
you have to collaborate with other
people

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
at the police department
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
it can take some time but again we so as
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
a sheriff's office we've always worked
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
very well with other jurisdictions
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
especially those that are contained
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
within our own jurisdiction so
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
um the timeliness is normally you know
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
again we want to turn over cases and get
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
them cleared as quick as possible uh
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
that's for the victims and and for the
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
court prosecutions and all that so
 
01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:57.289 align:start position:0%
court prosecutions and all that so
um

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
we don't really have those problems what
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
comes into a problem is the the
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
technicalities of the cases computer
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
crimes we're waiting for you know we got
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
a sense subpoena as a search warrant
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
south of California to get uh different
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
documentation and things from these uh
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
internet companies that can take some
 
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.410 align:start position:0%
internet companies that can take some
time

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
um different Court processes that happen
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
sometimes delay the cases themselves so
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
we don't really have too much delay when
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
it comes to Cooperative efforts with
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
local PDS
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
I have one final pink card uh Kate
 
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:54.730 align:start position:0%
I have one final pink card uh Kate
Horgan

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:54.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kade Horgan I
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
of counties
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
um and yes we heard the legislature loud
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
and clear last year it was said in the
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
floor debate if you want this change for
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
your counties make sure to get the
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
support of your delegation and bring the
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill in just for your county that is
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
what Belknap has done they have the
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
support of their delegation these are
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
administrative positions and as the
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
sheriff pointed out making changes often
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
takes more than two years especially in
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
your registered Deeds office who are if
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
they have not already they are in the
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
process of putting you all of your Deeds
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
that you are responsible for online so
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
that the public can access them that is
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
not something that can be done in two
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
years it is a multi-year project I'm
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but everyone
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
else has covered all of the other points
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make and I'll conclude my
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative uh yokella
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll I'll try and ask
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
um my question again and see if if
 
01:08:06.299 --> 01:08:06.910 align:start position:0%
um my question again and see if if
um

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
you have a different and can address it
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
a different way so every time I ask
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
about the oversight by the electorate
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
people are responding about how you know
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
their job is complicated or it would be
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
easier for their job but I'm trying to
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
um to assess the the value of of the
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
actual legislative
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
body that elects the people and being
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
able to oversize oversee
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
these changes that are being implemented
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
if if it's going according to plan they
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
might re-elect them but if they don't
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the uh the people be able
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
to say this is not the path that we need
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
to go down I want to vote you out of
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
office why is that not appropriate thank
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
ukella I would say it is not
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
reducing oversight they still have to
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
run they still have to get elected we're
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
just increasing the amount of time that
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
they have in the office and the voters
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham County who went through
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
this the last time there were no changes
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
in Sheriff Deeds register of probate
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
County attorney there were no changes
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
they already think that their people are
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
on the right path and I believe it was
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier the turnover in these
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
positions is very low so I don't think
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
it would change the oversight because
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.789 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:52.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill is sponsored by indiv
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
legislators from Belknap County and in
 
01:09:58.810 --> 01:09:58.820 align:start position:0%
your testimony you made the comment that
 
01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:01.820 align:start position:0%
Belknap county has support from their
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
delegation could you expound on that and
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
clarify what exactly do you mean by that
 
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
statement it is my understanding and I
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
would defer to the sponsor to confirm
 
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
this but that their delegation discussed
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
this bill and supports this bill but I
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
would defer to the representative from
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
so you know no more questions I have one
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
quick one for you for the benefit of
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
those of us who were not on this
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
committee last year could you give an
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
executive description or a version of
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
why the bill last year
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh to make all counties for this four
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
years why did that fail so this bill was
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
changed by the committee to impact All
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
Counties it went to the house floor and
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
it was actually on the consent calendar
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
it was I believe a unanimous or nearly
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote out of this committee
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh it was pulled from the consent
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
calendar and uh the testimony or the
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
floor debate specifically said not every
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
delegation got to weigh in on this bill
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
so therefore we want to make sure each
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
delegation has the opportunity to weigh
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
in on that bill I believe it was
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
specifically said if Rockingham wants to
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
do this and they have their delegation
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
support then yes let's pass that but
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
every other delegation needs the
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in to see if that
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense for their County
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
my question so it was on the floor that
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
it changed but as a committee it was
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous so bringing you the bill is
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
being brought to the committee it was
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
very clear last time when we voted on
 
01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:58.100 align:start position:0%
that to do a uniform across the counties
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
having said that having shown the action
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
why this time just one county is my
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question it
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
was stated to us very clearly
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative that we if we were going
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
to bring this back it needed to be done
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
um when you say it was stated to us
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
could you specify who specifically
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it was said in
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
the floor debate
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay see no more questions thank you
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Ms Horgan um could
 
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:44.540 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh I guess representative Boger could
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
municipal County
 
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee the record I am Ralph boam
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro district 14 town of Litchfield
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
I have a former Selectmen School Board
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
budget committee and 15 years here
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I understand the probably Amendment
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
coming on this which probably I look
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
forward I went around and around with
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
legislative services on this language
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I just gave up with him anyway
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
current law states that state funds
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to lobby for legislation
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
in 2006 when I was on Election law
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
commission committee we amended RSA 15-5
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
to state that the towns and school
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
districts must keep funds for lobbying
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
agencies and several accounts that do
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
not use State funds I doubt that anyone
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
is doing this
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
also lobbying agencies such as a
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and a School Board
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
Association do not represent the
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and they actually Lobby against
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
lobbying for the town and School Board
 
01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
lobbying for the town and School Board
Administrations

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
Administrations
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
a good example of this at the municipal
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
Association lobbied against the bill
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
that would have made it clear that the
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
default budget was never supposed to be
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
higher than the proposed operating
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
budget this house
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the house passed us
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
last year but the municipal Association
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
lobbied successfully in the Senate to
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
kill the bill like I said the and the
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is paying these associations
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
this bill will make it transparent to
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer that they are funding
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
lobbying for their town and School
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
District administration with local funds
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
only let's have some transparency and
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
let the people decide thank you
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do we have
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
so when I look at the the architecture
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill in in the language
 
01:17:58.570 --> 01:17:58.580 align:start position:0%
I see that your um
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
referencing RSA 15 colon 5 and also
 
01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
referencing RSA 15 colon 5 and also
um

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're putting in a new section
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
so my question is is
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
why did you choose to
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
um make these amendments to to do what
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do in in this bill and and
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
do it within those sections of Statute
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
budget preparation
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
and that would be RSA 32 colon 5.
 
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
and that would be RSA 32 colon 5.
because

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
the 15-5 specifically is there for
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying purposes can't you not use
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
State funds for lobbying for example a a
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
state agency cannot come in and Lobby
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
for a bill
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
um about using State money so that's why
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
I put in that bill and I remember in the
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
testimony in 2006 when I was on Election
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
law the Pacific reason for putting in
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
for the separate accounts for Town and
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
School District can make but
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
specifically for taking care of the
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and the School
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
Board Association because people had
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
problems with it then also so again it's
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
the school districts and towns get State
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
money we go and make sure that the
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
people know for any lobbyists including
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
a city might hire their own lobbyists
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that only local money can be used so
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's why I use 15.5 because that's
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
where the current law is about State
 
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
money for lobbying
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
but if you
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
think it could be somewhere else I mean
 
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.050 align:start position:0%
think it could be somewhere else I mean
yeah

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative your
 
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.510 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative your
fella

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
fella
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.689 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
question

01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:59.699 --> 01:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.350 align:start position:0%
um
why

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
is why did you make it just a one-time
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
vote and and uh
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the town to to Grant lobbyists
 
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.790 align:start position:0%
of the town to to Grant lobbyists
lobbying

01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.630 align:start position:0%
lobbying
um

01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
well the money well more make it
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
transparent but it could be maybe make
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
it put it in the budget staying it's got
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be all the time I would be full in
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
favor of that also you know but uh you
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
know if you want to change the law doing
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
that I'll be
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's okay with me if I just want to
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
also to make it transparent to you no
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
local fund only your tax dollars is
 
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
going for this agency
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative and it
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
may be a follow-up to representative
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
ukulla's question I I understand that
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
with this language there would have to
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
be a warrant article maybe inclusive of
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
all the agencies or maybe separate
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
Warren articles for each agency it seems
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
that that could be that there could be
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
discussion but my question is really the
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
budget then would also have to include
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
the funding for each one of those
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts and would these then if
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the budget is approved but the warrant
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
article fails that means then the
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
funding fails correct correct and and
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
the budget has all those line items in
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
the budget for funding your Municipal
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
Association what not but I only see one
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
one article for foot lobbying purposes I
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
mean the school districts would have one
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
the municipality in the town will have
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
one I mean if the city like Nashville
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
wants to hire their own Lobby that's
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
done in the city government not in town
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's only going to be maybe
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
one extra but then like representing
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
Powell said maybe we should be let's put
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
in law and 32 column five I mean that
 
01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:01.460 align:start position:0%
would be okay with me also like
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
so let's say this goes into effect and
 
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
so let's say this goes into effect and
um

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
um
some

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
some towns
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
vote to approve warrant articles to
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
um fund these associations and then
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
other towns don't do so so
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
if that happens with the associations
 
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
if that happens with the associations
then

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
are be supposed to be
 
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.649 align:start position:0%
are be supposed to be
um representing

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
um representing
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
the interests of all towns are just the
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
ones that have paid decided to
 
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:42.260 align:start position:0%
um pay pay them
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much just the ones that pay them
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
for the sample I know in the uh in in
 
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:50.540 align:start position:0%
both agencies not all towns or cities
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
contribute and the school district there
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
are a number of school districts that do
 
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.229 align:start position:0%
are a number of school districts that do
not

01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to the School Board
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Association so I mean so what the point
 
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
is also if some people say some towns a
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
lot of towns say no then maybe even
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association School District
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
School Board Association will change
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
their policies
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
but that's one way of looking at it but
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean only they only represent
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
those municipalities that contribute to
 
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you define for
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
me lobbyist
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
well in this and this thing is lobbying
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
for a particular bill in other words I'm
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
for this bill I'm you know for what we
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
have the people but the orange tags
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing they are lobbying state agencies
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
cannot Lobby because they get State
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
money so for example I'm I was on the
 
01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
education for years and was always a
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
point when we asked the the doe
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Education what do you
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
think about this bill their answer was
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
always we can't say that
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
that'd be lobbying so that's lobbying
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
and misassociation I guess you don't
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
have really any I don't know state
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
agencies that can come and Lobby I mean
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
maybe the school board associate I mean
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association but they're
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
paid lobbyists and that's what I'm
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
talking paid lobbyists people that are
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
although

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would you consider a
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
if I mean
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah if they're pushing a particular
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
Bill if they're answering questions no
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
but if they're actually pushing a bill
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
then yeah they're lobbying
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and who decides whether they're
 
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
answering the questions yes thank you
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I apologize
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
who decides whether the person in front
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
of you is answering a question or
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
lobbying I mean you all I mean the point
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
is it's I mean like we we've I've been
 
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
on other sitting and in other committees
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
and I know some committees are kind of
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
lacks on letting their agencies really
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
lobby but I mean that's that's an issue
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
and in some cases but really State money
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for lobbying for obvious
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
purposes you know I mean we're paying
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and different
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
department heads
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
to do their job and their job is what we
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
decide as legislation not what they are
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
pushing they can answer questions but
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
they can't really shouldn't be really
 
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
they can't really shouldn't be really
pushing

01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
for a bill
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of a follow-up I'm sorry
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
I hope that works uh on representative
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
Davis's question so would you consider
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
like training on right to know or
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
training on hot the duties of a school
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
board member or training on how to do
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal work is that lobbying no
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
let's say doing what they're being paid
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
for by the school district and the
 
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
municipal for that training I mean
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
they're not coming here lobbying is
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
coming here
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay and saying we need this bill passed
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
so we can do this that's the lobbying by
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
doing the job that the school districts
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
and misflow stations is being paying for
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
them to do that's not representative
 
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
them to do that's not representative

for your testimony today is it not true
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
that a lobbyist must be registered uh
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
and that they advocate for a fee
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and in first case in this
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm over here I'm sorry okay
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
um you have mentioned several times that
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are always or it seems to me
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
always lobbying for a bill
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh what if a town
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't like a bill
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
who can come and Lobby against that bill
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
well when I was on the school board I
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
I've come here
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
when I was in the legislature also and
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
and talked on a bill
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know but
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
I'm I wasn't paid to be
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not paid to be a lobbyist but I was
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
paying for what my my school board
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
wanted me to talk about or as a private
 
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.930 align:start position:0%
wanted me to talk about or as a private
citizen

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
I mean that's no problem I'm not don't
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
have an orange tag I mean so I mean a
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
lot of cases I've had the private
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
citizen I've come
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
to to speak against or for a bill
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative color
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.890 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:07.550 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.890 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:28:08.890 --> 01:28:08.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are defined and who is
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
registered and what they can and cannot
 
01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
registered and what they can and cannot
do

01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
um in RSA 15 colon 1.
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
would would you be encouraging the
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
representatives to refer back to that
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
section or of law for what is a lobbyist
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
or what is not or or should we be taking
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
is basically giving what the rest of 15
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
is I mean so 15 5 is what what was the
 
01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
section that specifically says State
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
funds cannot be used
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
I mean that's
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
for lobbying and that's my my point
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative bench putty thank you Mr
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
tooth thank you representative for
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is it's a
 
01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.610 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is it's a
very

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
distinction between lobbyists and
 
01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:10.100 align:start position:0%
lobbying for a bill we have had
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
departments come and testify against or
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a bill would you consider that yes
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
as a lobbying debt breaking the law as
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
far as I can read 15 colon one through
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
five there they are there being paid by
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
to do a job
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
and if they come here in law before
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
against the bill in their position
 
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
that is against the law
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
now I have no problem with somebody
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
coming and and has a private citizen for
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
a bill but by lobbying for the
 
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.350 align:start position:0%
a bill but by lobbying for the
Department

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
no that's why I said in the Department
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
of Education whenever we've asked their
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
attorney or other members of the doe on
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
on what they think about a bill they
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
always say we can't say you make the
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
laws and we abide by them
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr follow up thank you but as
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
a committee members we do ask for input
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
from specific departments that comes to
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
my mind right now is the Secretary of
 
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
States where we needed a response and
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
they had to say whether the support or
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
not or how would it impact would that be
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
considered lobbying I've I've run it
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
across that in the election law and I
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
think some of the comments a very
 
01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
borderline on being
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
being lobbying and they should say you
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
know they should the question to be
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
asked what do you think I mean but they
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to your testimony and I'm
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to ask you again
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
who draws the line between what is
 
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.050 align:start position:0%
who draws the line between what is
considered

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
by you and other supporters of this bill
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
as lobbying for or against a bill
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
and who is exercising their right of
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
free speech it seems to me that anyone
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
anyone who has anything to do with a
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
formal State body
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
who is arguing for or against a piece of
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
legislation or a policy would be
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
considered a lobbyist
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
under the terms of this well the point
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
is like I mean
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 15 I think makes it pretty clear if
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
you're gaining State money you cannot
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
Lobby that that's pretty clear I mean
 
01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
Lobby that that's pretty clear I mean
um

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
so like if I'm getting if I'm getting a
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
salary from the state
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
I I shouldn't be loud and I don't think
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's for us as legislators to
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to wrap this up this
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
right individual up really quick uh
 
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh represent a brown
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
quickly please
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
question so if we asked uh some from the
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
Eternal generals officer Department of
 
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.950 align:start position:0%
Eternal generals officer Department of
Education

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
what difficulties would this cause or is
 
01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
this uh legal or what would be involved
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
with implementing this
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay I think if you ask like if
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's legal on and they can existing law
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
or maybe State no the existing law says
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
you can't do that then that that's fine
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
but they can't be pushing for anything
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up quickly
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative so so as long as they
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't give their opinion they're not
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.870 align:start position:0%
don't give their opinion they're not
lobbying

01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you asking questions that's fine
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
testimony we are going to move on we are
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
getting behind uh gonna call nature
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and H Grace for the
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we are opposed to
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the committee had a number of good
 
01:33:20.159 --> 01:33:21.169 align:start position:0%
um the committee had a number of good
questions

01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to start out by saying
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
that uh I have a couple handouts for you
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh we have a letter and I am also
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
handing a letter on behalf of Lori Radke
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator for Hollis who
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it today but wish to
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
provide the the committee with some
 
01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
provide the the committee with some
information

01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
a number of committee members had uh
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
questions about who draws the line
 
01:33:49.199 --> 01:33:50.450 align:start position:0%
questions about who draws the line
between

01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
um free speech and lobbying and how
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
exactly this relates to
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
state agencies and the kind of
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
information they provide as some do come
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
in and uh support or oppose legislation
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and I agree that this is an
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult line to draw as
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from me later today there
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
are a number of bills coming before you
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
today that we do not have a position on
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
but just wish to provide some technical
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
information on I'm cautious so I count
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
that as lobbying time but I understand
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's a difference of opinion there
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
um there are three main points I want to
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
make uh today before you
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so I want to draw your attention to
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
lines seven and eight where it refers to
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
each agency
 
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and that towns and and essentially
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
this seems to state that towns can't use
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
one worn article to list all
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that would lobby with
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
money received
 
01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
and it's really unclear what the scope
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
of this is going to be
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
um being cautious I'd say that this is
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
going to end up cluttering the warrant
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
you could easily have a dozen or more
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
worn articles because you're talking
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
about building officials Public Works
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
Association Health officer Association
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
assessors Etc
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
um there are a ton of local I guess I
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
should say small organizations that
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
work with local officials in different
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
capacities and it's unclear where the
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
cutoff is for lobbying
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
um it's not really clear whether it's
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be inclusive of all those
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
organizations or other ones and just to
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
illustrate uh one RSA that you can look
 
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:26.990 align:start position:0%
illustrate uh one RSA that you can look
up

01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
where um just to show you how small an
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're talking about here
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 31 colon 8 which relates to the
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
assessors and town clerks their
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
Association is 20 bucks a year
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
um so you're having a separate one
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
article for 20 bucks
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
um there is a bill Senate Bill 88 that
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
might change that
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
um but it seems the intent here is to
 
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:53.540 align:start position:0%
Target dues and membership organizations
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
which offer more than just lobbying
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
services and that's my my second Point
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
here which is that
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
um really these organizations are the
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
way that Municipal officials
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in specialized areas
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
receive the training education they need
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do their jobs
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
I certainly am not a town clerk I don't
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
know all the aspects of what they do I'm
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
not an assessor I don't know what they
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
do I'm not a building official and
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
certainly I try as much as I can to help
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
out with them but when you're talking
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
about you know the intricate nature of
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
the building code and amendments the
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
building code potential amendments the
 
01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.350 align:start position:0%
building code potential amendments the
ramifications

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's not something that you know I
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
would have a specialty and that's
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
something that somebody who's familiar
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
with that has a specialty and that's why
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
they have these organizations so they
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
provide the specialized Education and
 
01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.410 align:start position:0%
provide the specialized Education and
Training

01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
Training
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and they often provide access to
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
state and federal resources that would
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
not otherwise be accessible to
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
to those officials so for example every
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
year I get to go over to the Wastewater
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
manager school at DES and provide
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
information to people training to become
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
Wastewater managers so that you can all
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
have public sewer systems and provide
 
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
them information about the right to know
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
law because as local officials they have
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
to know what that is
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
understand what it is and if they get a
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
night a right to no law request
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
understand how to respond to it
 
01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.910 align:start position:0%
understand how to respond to it
appropriately

01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes the training and training
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
and educational resources provided by
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
these special organizations are not
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
provided by any other entity
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
so you know for nhma's sake we've
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
inherited some trainings that aren't put
 
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
on by state agencies anymore we put on
 
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
Specialized trainings for land use
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
officials who put on Specialized
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
trainings for
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
um Trustees of trust funds for Cemetery
 
01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.890 align:start position:0%
um Trustees of trust funds for Cemetery
trustees

01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
trustees
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
um for Library trustees some of that
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
used to be done by the state it's not
 
01:37:53.159 --> 01:37:54.229 align:start position:0%
used to be done by the state it's not
anymore

01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
some of some training is done in
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the state and some we
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
just do entirely separately I counted it
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
up and I don't remember exactly the
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
number but when I introduced myself to
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
the committee a few weeks ago I said it
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
was somewhere around 80 I think
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
trainings we did
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
last year with our basically four staff
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
members doing those
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's a lot more than just here
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
because we do that we do provide legal
 
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
advice to cities and towns that call
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and obviously I come here and talk to
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
all of you about legislation
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
and currently the cost to be a uh a
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
member of any of these organizations is
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
included in the budget it's typically
 
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
under a line called do's and
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
subscriptions or dues and memberships uh
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
it depends on your specific Town um how
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to name that but if you do
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
have a sub account
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
information the municipal budget law
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
under 32 colon 5 Roman one does require
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that information be available for
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
public inspection at the budget hearing
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a definition of what a
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
sub-account means under 32 colon 3. so
 
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
voters can already see what they're
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
looking what money is going out of the
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
town they can already determine
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
a town meeting where they think it's
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their towns to be
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
members of their organizations
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
um or you know officials to be members
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
of those organizations
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
and they can determine whether to
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
authorize or remove that expenditure um
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
they you know if it's something that the
 
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
governing body put in if you're an SP2
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
Town deliberative session certainly make
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
that motion to remove that line and
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
prevent that expenditure from occurring
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
or on the floor of a town meeting a
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting and of course
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
you could have a separate War article
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
that would trigger no means no so you
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
could put in a warn article that says
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know don't fund whatever the
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
organization is and that has certainly
 
01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.510 align:start position:0%
organization is and that has certainly
happened

01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
um in the past there have been
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
um municipalities that have decided for
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
example not to be members of nhma
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
Merrimack is one of those Salem is one
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
of those they weren't members for a
 
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.709 align:start position:0%
of those they weren't members for a
while

01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take any questions the
 
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions uh
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative ukella thank you thank
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
you seem to be
 
01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:15.970 align:start position:0%
you seem to be
um

01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:15.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
implying that
 
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
um the trainings and the lobbies
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts go hand in hand is
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
there any reason that these efforts
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
couldn't be split out and paid for
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
separately and not
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
um not uh
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
tied together in in the way that you're
 
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.750 align:start position:0%
tied together in in the way that you're
describing

01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
describing
 
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.610 align:start position:0%
describing
so

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
I guess that goes
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the question of you
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
know what was the role of people who
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
come here
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and in part to provide information
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
um state agencies certainly required to
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
to do that but they may have some sort
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
of best practice they want to share or
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
some sort of policy that they think
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
would be easier to implement and
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
therefore would have a position on it
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's often developed through the
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
course of those trainings because you
 
01:41:08.090 --> 01:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
know when you get a bunch of people
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
together in a room who have a specialty
 
01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.570 align:start position:0%
together in a room who have a specialty
they

01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
can talk about whatever the issue is and
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
run through different scenarios and what
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
might be possible what might not be
 
01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:21.179 align:start position:0%
possible and that's that's uh frequently
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
what happens uh especially with
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the really specialized organizations
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to point something else
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
out which is that
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
I understand the intent is to prevent
 
01:41:38.169 --> 01:41:38.179 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts but from
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
local officials really but
 
01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:42.590 align:start position:0%
local officials really but
um

01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
towns also and and local officials
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
structure this differently so I think
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
one of the organizations you will not
 
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:50.699 align:start position:0%
see sign in support sign in opposition
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
unless I've I've not done my homework
 
01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
correctly is the fire chiefs Association
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that's because they don't take money
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
directly from the town
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
um they end up each individual chief
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
decides to join that organization or not
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they have a lobbyist here that's uh
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe you're answering his
 
01:42:12.609 --> 01:42:12.619 align:start position:0%
questions anymore
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
Grace for taking my question
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
um the lobbying effort we we're talking
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
about here seems to be I'm going to use
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
the word reactive
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that the lobbying would be in
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
response to something
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
um but the lobbying that uh the the
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
efforts from nhma are a response to a
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
process can you explain that process and
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
how it could be affected by this bill
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely so uh every election year
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
um we at nhma ask local officials to
 
01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be part of one of three
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
committees that looks at what our
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
existing policies are for what we
 
01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
advocate for at the legislature
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
these committees uh typically end up
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
being between 15 and 20 people sign up
 
01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
and usually between 12 and 15 actually
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
show up so they're not big committees
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
they they look at what our policies are
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
they make suggestions about how to
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
change those those suggestions then get
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
compiled mailed out to all of our all of
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
our members which is currently all 234
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and those members get a
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
chance to look at them in advance
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
decide if they support them if they
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
don't support them if they want any
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
changes and we have a policy conference
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's I would say and now I guess to
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
what happens uh on the the floor of the
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
house and so we try to get as many uh of
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns together who are
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
our members and they decide what they
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
want us to come advocate for so you know
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
this year we saw some changes with what
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
we do for housing in response to the
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
fact that there doesn't seem to be
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
enough housing and so we were told to go
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
advocate for
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
um four bills that would allow more
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this is a
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the representatives
 
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
question that you um just answered so
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
you explained that you have this process
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
with committees that local locally
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
elected officials or appointed officials
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
are part of these committees in a board
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
of directors perhaps to to get
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
information with regards to New
 
01:44:44.169 --> 01:44:44.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal associations
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
positions and what you're going to
 
01:44:50.689 --> 01:44:50.699 align:start position:0%
provide input with regard to legislation
 
01:44:55.450 --> 01:44:55.460 align:start position:0%
and and in committee so my question is
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
these um local local officials do they
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
in turn turn to the taxpayer and and get
 
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
information from the taxpayer in terms
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
of what type of input is brought forward
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
with regards to the process that you
 
01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.010 align:start position:0%
with regards to the process that you
explained

01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
so there's no like legislative body vote
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
at the local level they would typically
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
it would be the governing body so the
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
select board or the city council that
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
would that would weigh in on these
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
obviously they are always concerned
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
about what their property tax rate is so
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
that is something that
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly comes into consideration
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
when they tell us what we should
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
um we we really need to get a move on if
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a question that has not
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
been asked and answered representative
 
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.890 align:start position:0%
been asked and answered representative
Gilman

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:45:59.330 --> 01:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
um just just to follow up on
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative Powers thing uh if I'm us
 
01:46:07.609 --> 01:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's anecdotal so if I'm not elected as
 
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
a select board member and also a state
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative and my slip board decides
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh to vote on whether to support or
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
oppose a bill
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
if I bring that decision back to the
 
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:28.189 align:start position:0%
 
possible

01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
I will say that there is
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
um the AG's office and Secretary of
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
State's office did produce a guidance
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
document a few years ago about what it
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
means to be a lobbyist I'm not entirely
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand that guidance
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
document so I always try to be as
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
conservative as possible that's fine
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood last uh question
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
for rep Mr Grace thank you Mr chairman
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Grace thank you for taking my
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
question is it not true that nhma
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
provides advisory only legal advice to
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
towns and if so can that advice be used
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
adversely against any taxpayer
 
01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
adversely against any taxpayer
so

01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
nhma provides General legal advice so if
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
you had a you know you had a question
 
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.750 align:start position:0%
you had a you know you had a question
about

01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
how the right to know law works or
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
something you could as a local official
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
you could call and we would provide you
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that advice
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
um generally we get called in response
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
to specific questions that local
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
officials have it may be the case that
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's in response to a citizen inquiry
 
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
and we have some municipalities that
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
just call us in response to that some
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
don't whether they release that
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
information to the public or not is is
 
01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:51.659 align:start position:0%
not up to us and whether there's sort of
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
uh subsidiary effects they go to Town
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
Council and talk to them about the
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
advice we have is is not up to us either
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
because each town has their own their
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
own lawyer that would go to court for
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
them we don't go to court for towns okay
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Grace
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
um we have four more thank you
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
individuals who wish to testify I'm
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to ask and uh I'm going to ask by
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
chairman power to use their stopwatch
 
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
here most of you have all said you need
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
two or three minutes we're going to hold
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
you to less than three minutes if it's
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
already been said don't repeat it if
 
01:48:27.169 --> 01:48:27.179 align:start position:0%
it's uh if you get questions I'd ask you
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
to respond in your questions briefly and
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
concisely and specifically we're running
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
behind we need to get caught up here so
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Eric power I am a resident
 
01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
of Brookline New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
representing the sdga organization which
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
is the school district governance
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
um just for backgrounds I've served on a
 
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board I've headed DPW
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
study committee budget.com Bud com study
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm currently on the
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
planning board in Brookline
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I've had a lot of good interactions
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association and
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
the School Board Association from those
 
01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.689 align:start position:0%
the School Board Association from those
roles

01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
roles
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
but I realized that they provide they do
 
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of good services but they
 
01:49:26.209 --> 01:49:26.219 align:start position:0%
also do lobbying and there's a
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
distinction there and what they're doing
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
this year I've actually put petitions
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
into two of our school districts or
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline Co-op and our Brookline
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
School District to try to zero out that
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
line item I've received um
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of resistance from that saying
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
whether deciding whether that's legal or
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
not so we're going to see where that
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
goes that's in this year's town meeting
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I've also worked a lot in the defense
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
industry on government contracts
 
01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
whenever there's money being used for
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
lobbying it always has to be separated
 
01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:54.229 align:start position:0%
lobbying it always has to be separated
out

01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's considered what they call a
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
non-allowable cost
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's important because we just
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
can't use the money and mix it together
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
I also serve in the Air Force for 30
 
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
years in the National Guard and I also
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
joined the National Guard Association
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
but I paid the dues myself I decided
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
they do lobbying but it was my money it
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't being paid by the Air Force
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
so that's an important piece
 
01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the solution to this
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
would be to put a uh this the intent of
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
this bill in RSA 32-5
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
and it would clearly state that an
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
operating budget for a municipality
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
which would also include is School
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
District cannot allow any uh money
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
that's lobbying under RSA 15 1.
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
but if the governing body with the
 
01:50:46.129 --> 01:50:46.139 align:start position:0%
school board or the select board decided
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to have these services
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
for lobbying from an organization and it
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
could be multiple organizations it would
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
have to be in a special Warren article
 
01:50:56.570 --> 01:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
so it would have to be pulled out of the
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
budget so there would be an operating
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
budget and if they chose if they decided
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
to do have lobbying money and they could
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
put all the organizations that the town
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
has or all the organizations the school
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
district has in one article they could
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
they could do that and let the voters
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
decide if they want those services for
 
01:51:11.159 --> 01:51:12.590 align:start position:0%
decide if they want those services for
lobbying

01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a very clean way
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
this would require however for nhma and
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
School Board Association and others to
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
tell the towns and school districts
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
here's the money we use for services and
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
here's the money that we're using for
 
01:51:30.890 --> 01:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
lobbying which is not a bad thing to do
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I'd also say just from my own
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
experience on the various roles that
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
I've had over the years and also the
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
position of the school district
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
governance Association that very
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
frequently the lobbyists are going
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
against the wills of the parents and the
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and they're more for the
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
administration of the school and the the
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
town employees and town administrators
 
01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important for the for
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to be able to have this a
 
01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
separate Warren article and I'd be glad
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you thank
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are the questions
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative troll Evan
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:52:13.729 --> 01:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
power coming to testify before us today
 
01:52:13.739 --> 01:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
power coming to testify before us today
um

01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
are you in favor or opposed to the bill
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
because you didn't state it at the
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of your and I listened very
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
carefully to what you said I want to be
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
sure that I get you correctly
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm we are in favor of this bill with
 
01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:30.659 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tre Levin she
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
brings up a good point uh when you do
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
come up and testify initially say
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
whether you're foreign against uh
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
question if I heard correctly you said
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
you put in a petition to zero out the
 
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
line for the appropriation in the budget
 
01:52:52.689 --> 01:52:52.699 align:start position:0%
and I just want to be clear that the the
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
advocacy for this if I understand it
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
correctly is to specifically denote that
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
there is an expenditure for so in your
 
01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.629 align:start position:0%
there is an expenditure for so in your
town

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting are those funds
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
co-mingled somehow or is it specific in
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
your town
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
so there is a budget line item in the
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
town budget there's a budget line item
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
in a School District budget for the for
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
the school district associate the
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the the School Board Association or
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
it is including the lobbying money but
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
it also includes all the other services
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
so what you're forced to do as a
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayer we might and I've seen the
 
01:53:33.609 --> 01:53:33.619 align:start position:0%
benefit of it we have to decide between
 
01:53:36.649 --> 01:53:36.659 align:start position:0%
taking everything they have to offer or
 
01:53:36.659 --> 01:53:37.729 align:start position:0%
taking everything they have to offer or
nothing

01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have to we so if we can have to say
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
we might want some of your Educational
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
Services which which are great but we
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't want the lobbying part that's the
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking to do here and
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
this is what this law would do to
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
separate those two things out and then
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
let the voters decide it's not
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
preventing it it's just a separate
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
I understand that you support the bill
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that you support it
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the amendment what would that
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
Amendment be
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment would be an addition to
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
RSA 32-5 where you would basically State
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
something along the lines that a
 
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget cannot contain any
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
funds that would be used for lobbying
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 15 1
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
and that a governing body may may add a
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
separate special worn article for the
 
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
purposes of lobbying funds to be
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
presented to the voters
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
a simple two sentence Amendment
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned in your previous
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
testimony that frequently and I'm
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing here so
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
bear with me uh you mentioned that
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
frequently the advice of so-called
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
lobbyists went against the will of the
 
01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:00.890 align:start position:0%
lobbyists went against the will of the
voters

01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
can you expound on that
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
well you mean you look at what's parents
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights for example
 
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll testify against it they
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
testify against updates to collective
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements both in the town
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
and um in the school districts
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
so it's it's the general consensus and
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
you heard it from representative Bohm
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the the positions that they take
 
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
are almost always I could go through
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
bill after Bill after Bill and you know
 
01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
their position is always opposite almost
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
always opposite of what I and others
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
like me that are taxpayers and parents
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
believe that's the best way to concisely
 
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
do it you could have a whole hour about
 
01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:47.149 align:start position:0%
do it you could have a whole hour about
that

01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
so theoretically if the those same
 
01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
organizations took positions against
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
those policies that you specified
 
01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
what would be your approach in that
 
01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
what would be your approach in that
scenario

01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the question
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
would you still be considered lobbyists
 
01:56:15.169 --> 01:56:15.179 align:start position:0%
that need warrant articles for approval
 
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
if they supported
 
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
the legislation or the policies that you
 
01:56:22.609 --> 01:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
are saying go go against the will of the
 
01:56:22.619 --> 01:56:23.629 align:start position:0%
are saying go go against the will of the
voters

01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
I think you have to look at everything
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
my question is to go back in your
 
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
testimony you said you
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
got the membership as a Marine
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
for individual you didn't do it as
 
01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.310 align:start position:0%
for individual you didn't do it as
um

01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:57.890 --> 01:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
for your organization
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
correct so you were trying to
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
Lobby or get Lobby for your personal
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
gain a personal representation not for
 
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.330 align:start position:0%
gain a personal representation not for
marine

01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
marine
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
National Guard so
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
how did you draw the line I I'm still
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out you know who draws
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
the line and how do you draw that line
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
so the point I was trying to make there
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
is I joined the National Guard
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
Association National Guard Association
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
has many services but they also do
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
lobbying both at the federal and state
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
level the point is is that the money
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
that they get is not coming from
 
01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.229 align:start position:0%
that they get is not coming from
taxpayers

01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's not coming from tax paying funds
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's coming from individuals that decide
 
01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
voluntarily to support those
 
01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
organizations just like the previous
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
speaker spoke about the fire chiefs
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
Association that doesn't they're not
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
using our our the funds raised locally
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
by taxpayers to pay for that those Fire
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
Chiefs are paying out of their own funds
 
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
their own personal funds because that's
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
important to them that's the way it
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be taxpayers as a group should
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
decide if they want to have the lobbying
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
or if they don't and it could be done on
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
an annual basis
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
um so just to follow up on
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative stavis's question she was
 
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
asking about a statement
 
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:29.510 align:start position:0%
asking about a statement
um

01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
you made saying that these associations
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
go against the will of Voters however
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
the way I remember it was you saying
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
they went against the will of taxpayers
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
can you clarify which one of those you
 
01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:45.109 align:start position:0%
can you clarify which one of those you
said

01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:58:47.629 --> 01:58:47.639 align:start position:0%
I believe I said that it was taxpayers
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
and parents okay and many of those folks
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
are also voters are there voters who are
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
not taxpayers or parents representative
 
01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:56.510 align:start position:0%
not taxpayers or parents representative
follow-up

01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
you may follow up are are there voters
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
who are not taxpayers or parents who
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
deserve to have their interests
 
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
that is a that is true that those could
 
01:59:14.930 --> 01:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
also be cases and they get a vote at the

talking about individually having a say
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't this body be all of New
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to and we listen to
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist pro and con and don't have
 
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
to take their opinions isn't that what
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're here representing
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
my my position on this is that the
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislative body in a town or School
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
District should decide if they want to
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
support lobbying activities with the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
monies raised out of their taxes that
 
02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
that's a decision that's local decision
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
that should be done annually that's what
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would achieve and that's how
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
their voice would be heard
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%

02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%

committee my name is bear Christina I'm
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association we
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I will try and be um as quick as
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
possible uh Mr chair
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um we do reiterate um some of the uh
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
points that have been made by the New
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
um a couple asked other aspects relative
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
um while this is targeted at nhma and
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
Association as I'm reading the language
 
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
it says for each agency that does
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
lobbying and another speaker spoke of
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
how um you know our services are bundled
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
we provide services to school boards the
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
same way that the municipal Association
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
provides services to municipalities we
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
have a staff attorney that answers phone
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
calls uh an email is from
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
superintendents and school board members
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
we provide hours and hours and hours of
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
training every year for school boards
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
um but there are other agencies and
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
entities and companies that school
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
districts pay money to that turn around
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
and Lobby so I don't know how that can
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
be bifurcated Xfinity lobbies school
 
02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
districts pay for cable bills waste
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
disposal lobbies they pick up the trash
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's State money if I'm not
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
mistaken probably local money because
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
your adequacy is not paying for your
 
02:02:03.850 --> 02:02:03.860 align:start position:0%
trash removal
 
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
construction companies Waste Management
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
Comcast eversource Unitil so are we
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
going to be putting separate warrant
 
02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:14.060 align:start position:0%
articles on on the school district
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
warrant for every entity that every
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
school district pays money to that turns
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
around and then comes back and lobbies
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
within this building it's it's a little
 
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
bit of it's a little bit absurd the
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
other aspect to representative boam
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
um going against the interest of
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers on the contrary I think nhsba
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
saves taxpayers lots of money every
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
single year through dues they're able to
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
pay my salary my staff attorney's salary
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
so we can provide the those trainings
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
for free we don't provide it we don't we
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't charge any additional money
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
outside of our regular dues for school
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
board training we travel all over the
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
state and do dozens and dozens and
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
dozens of these a year
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
if they if we didn't exist and we're not
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
able to provide that sort of training
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
school districts would be hiring
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at three or four hundred
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour and that would be ripped
 
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
they did it it would we save money by
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
them being able to pull their money to
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
an association like nhsba so we can
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
provide those resources the last aspect
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill itself in a
 
02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:16.139 align:start position:0%
possible proposal that the previous
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
speaker brought up it's impossible to
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
know in any given legislative session
 
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
how much nhsba spends on lobbying in
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
part that's due to the number of bills
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
nhsba is tracking 220 bills this year
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
probably gonna have our reports are
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
going to be higher than they would be if
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
there were only 100 bills so bifurcating
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
the money every single year you know
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
this money is for lobbying this money is
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the the other services it it it it'd
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
be it's impractical and it's impossible
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
one year I might spend five thousand
 
02:03:49.129 --> 02:03:49.139 align:start position:0%
dollars five thousand dollars to my
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
salary might be used for lobbying
 
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
another year it might be ten thousand
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
dollars it depends on the number of
 
02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
bills and how active nhsba is and how
 
02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.139 align:start position:0%
many bills there are that are impacting
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
local school districts so the proposal
 
02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:03.179 align:start position:0%
we you know we disagree with the the
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
initial bill we oppose the initial bill
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
and the other proposals don't don't make
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
any sense either
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I think those are most of the points
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make
 
02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:14.750 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make
um

02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
they are indeed you are at three minutes
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
and 30. I'm happy to answer any
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your Indulgence
 
02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.490 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your Indulgence
representative

02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
attorney Christina for taking my
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
question so in your opening statement
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
you made the comment that this bill
 
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
specifically targets both New Hampshire
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association in the New
 
02:04:36.250 --> 02:04:36.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association
 
02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
reading the text of this bill
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that could you provide
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
evidence as to that statement yeah thank
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative of my my evidence would
 
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
be representative boam's opening
 
02:04:50.530 --> 02:04:50.540 align:start position:0%
statement he was introducing the bill
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the primary target was nhsba in the
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
02:05:00.609 --> 02:05:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair a
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
quick question you did allude to the
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
fact that on a in a given year it could
 
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
be five or ten thousand even if you go
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
to the granular level each day is it
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
practical for you to say I spent two
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
hours on the phone lobbying for this
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
three hours for education is that
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
possible thank you thank you very much
 
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
for the question we try and do that as
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
best as we possibly as best as we
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
probably possibly can we're open and
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
transparent with the amount of lobbying
 
02:05:36.169 --> 02:05:36.179 align:start position:0%
that we do we file all the all the
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
required quarterly reports register
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
um as um I believe Mr Gray has said
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
um the definition of lobbying is also
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
very challenging I've been sitting in
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
this room for two hours for an hour and
 
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
a half I was checking my email and doing
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
other work was I lobbying by being here
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know we try and be overly
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
cautious with those reports so you know
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to hide anything about it
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative you Keller thank you
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:06.290 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
um

02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
it if the uh legislature is it is it
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
true that your your testimony is that if
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature said that dues
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
paid by the um town can own cannot
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
include lobbying
 
02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and the lobbying efforts would have
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
um voted on separately for the amount
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
that that was requested by those
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
agencies to do lobbying are you saying
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:38.589 align:start position:0%
that that is
um

02:06:38.589 --> 02:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
impossible for you guys to be able to
 
02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
adhere to that law if we passed it sure
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the for the
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
question I hope I understood your
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
question correctly my statement would be
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
that if if you were at to ask us to sort
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
of bifurcate the money so let's say your
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
school district pays three thousand
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
dollars to nhsba I'm just using this as
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
an example I'd say 2500 of that is for
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
our general Services legal policy
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
training Etc 500 is for the quote
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
unquote lobbying I don't that that 500
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be different every single
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
year I don't know how much I Lobby in
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
any given year until I fill out my my
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
year-end reports meanwhile we've got
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
annual meetings in March with a certain
 
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
number designated on the warrant for how
 
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
much of that money is going to nhsba's
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
lobbying you know I have no idea what my
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
my March April and May lobbying reports
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
are going to look like until we get
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
through them so I have I don't know how
 
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
we can bifurcate the money
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
um without knowing what mine and anybody
 
02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:39.179 align:start position:0%
else's lobbying expenses is going to
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
look like at the end of the year I can't
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
bifurcate that out until
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
I I just don't I don't I don't know how
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
we would be able to do that
 
02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.129 align:start position:0%
we would be able to do that
representative

02:07:48.129 --> 02:07:48.139 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so from a
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
practical perspective let's say 25 of
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
the towns did a warrant article and said
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
we don't want you to lobby for us
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
anymore but the rest of the towns in the
 
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
states said no we're good with that how
 
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
would that change your lobbying efforts
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much I mean we'd
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to sort of
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
restructure our dues and just to be
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
clear to the lobbying efforts um are are
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
not the same as nhma but we have it what
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
we call our delegate assembly every
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
school board that's a member it's like
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
an annual meeting it's our annual
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
meeting essentially and school boards
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
submit what would be akin to a
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant article they
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
submitted nhsba opposes X Y and Z and
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
hsba supports X Y and Z our board of
 
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
directors then gives it a yes recommend
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
no recommend that carries absolutely no
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
weight at all and then we put it out to
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the body we put it out to the devil gets
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
that show up and they vote on our
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman's been to them I'd
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
been a number of them
 
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
um when he was still on his school board
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
15 or so years ago so it's it's not me
 
02:08:53.089 --> 02:08:53.099 align:start position:0%
thinking this is a good idea it's not my
 
02:08:54.770 --> 02:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
board of directors thinking yes on this
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill no on this bill the positions that
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
we take here at the uh at the at the
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislature are are dictated by our
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
members telling us what we want to do
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
and one point on that a statement was
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
made that nhsba opposed you're no longer
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
answering uh representative Brown's
 
02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
questions and I I'll reiterate a grant
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
again please if you're answering a
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
question try to keep it as concise as uh
 
02:09:18.609 --> 02:09:18.619 align:start position:0%
possible we don't need to hear
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
repetition uh representative stavis
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
um this this bill seeks to put in the
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
hands of the voters
 
02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
of a given town this decision and I'm
 
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%

02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
school board not on the planning board
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%

02:09:50.930 --> 02:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
does the average citizen have about
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
whether to say yay or nay on this one
 
02:09:59.209 --> 02:09:59.219 align:start position:0%

one final question I have for you then
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
we have to move on to the next um
 
02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
we have to move on to the next um
speaker

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned it a few times about
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
dues and uh structured how are they
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
structured sure um it's an uh it's a
 
02:10:55.729 --> 02:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
good question are bylaws have a um uh a
 
02:10:55.739 --> 02:10:56.990 align:start position:0%
good question are bylaws have a um uh a
provision

02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:10:59.330 --> 02:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
um that the dues are based on the amount
 
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
of local money raised in that particular
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
District excluding Capital costs and
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
excluding any federal funds
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I will say um my board of directors
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I have had conversations about
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
amending that I would also like to say
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
we have not raised dues in probably 12
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
or 13 years because we brought a tight
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
ship specifically how are they
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
calculated so there's there's a there's
 
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
a I I could probably be easier for me to
 
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
send it to your representative or Mr
 
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
chair there's a calculation formula
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
based on the amount of local money
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
raised that would be fine if you send us
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
an example of that that would be sure
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh we are going to move
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
on to the next speaker uh next testifier
 
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%

Nashua city clerk representing New
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerks
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
Association and we are opposed to this
 
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
bill currently our association collects
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars annually as an
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
association dues for each town in city
 
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
across the state all of our funds
 
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
whether from association dues or raise
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
as a result of Raffles other sales in
 
02:12:23.450 --> 02:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
our conference proceeds they go into one
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
account so be hard for us to separate
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
our current funds that we have to to pay
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
our lobbyists and we need to open
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
additional accounts to store these funds
 
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes one of the big
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
concerns we have with this bill
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that it says it takes effect within
 
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
60 days of passage which wouldn't be
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
enough time for towns most towns that
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a March
 
02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
election to get this question on the
 
02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
ballot for this year so it would pose a
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
problem until we can sort through what
 
02:13:00.609 --> 02:13:00.619 align:start position:0%
money we we raise from association dues
 
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
and what money we raise from
 
02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:04.669 align:start position:0%
and what money we raise from
um

02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:07.609 --> 02:13:07.619 align:start position:0%
other other proceeds
 
02:13:07.619 --> 02:13:08.209 align:start position:0%
other other proceeds
um

02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
until that until towns and cities could
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
actually get this on the ballot to
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
separate those funds
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
um we as an association try to follow
 
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
bills that directly affect the functions
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
of our job but we can't always attend
 
02:13:21.599 --> 02:13:22.669 align:start position:0%
of our job but we can't always attend
hearings

02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
and that's where we rely on our
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to give us uh reports so
 
02:13:29.569 --> 02:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
we rely on the information that they
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
send us so we can stay informed a lot of
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
bills that we follow and track they
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
directly affect us so we're opposed to
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
this bill and we agree with the uh the
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
letter that the nhma handed out to you
 
02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:45.060 align:start position:0%

02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be hard or difficult to
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
separate the amounts
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
would you be able to comply with the law
 
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
if we if we changed it so that dues are
 
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
if lobbying monies are not allowed to be
 
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
included in dues would you be able to
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
comply with that we'd be able to comply
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
we'd have to create an additional
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
account yes
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
um on the 60 days it would be tough
 
02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
60 days from Passage thank you seeing no
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr chair and honorable
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal County and
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
County government committee my name is
 
02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
Donna ma Burkett
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
I'm a former member of this illustrious
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
committee while serving the towns of New
 
02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%
Boston and Mount Vernon and I am
 
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
currently I currently serve as the chair
 
02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
of the New Boston select board
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention to my
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding HB 51 and in the
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
interest of your valuable time I will
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
keep it brief
 
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote in expedient to
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislate on HB 51.
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
HB 51 serves to remove the authority of
 
02:15:47.089 --> 02:15:47.099 align:start position:0%
local governing and legislative bodies
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
to determine the municipality's
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
expenditures on predominantly of
 
02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
predominantly local tax revenue
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
as a select board member I'm required to
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
manage the Prudential Affairs of the
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
Town including the development of a
 
02:16:04.129 --> 02:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
budget that serves the needs of our
 
02:16:04.139 --> 02:16:06.050 align:start position:0%
budget that serves the needs of our
community

02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
as citizens of our town have the
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
privilege and responsibility of
 
02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing and voting to approve or
 
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.810 align:start position:0%
reviewing and voting to approve or
reject

02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
reject
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
line items in our budget
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
so to consider a mandate
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
by legislators
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
on what and what cannot be paid for by
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
predominantly local tax dollar seems in
 
02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:28.189 align:start position:0%
predominantly local tax dollar seems in
overreach

02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
most of the members of this committee
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
are elected officials or serve their
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in other capacities
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
I would venture a guess that you and the
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
staff of your municipality have availed
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
themselves to the thousands of hours of
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
training and depth of expertise provided
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
by organizations
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
such as the New Hampshire cities and
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
town clerks Association
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
the building officials Association the
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
association of assessing officials
 
02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire School Board
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
Association just to name a few
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
unless we forget the New Hampshire
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association
 
02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
whose Financial legal and operations
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
expertise is available to assist local
 
02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.490 align:start position:0%
expertise is available to assist local
officials

02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
and others with valuable information and
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
training that cannot be obtained by any
 
02:17:21.889 --> 02:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
other organization or individual
 
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
while there may be some legislators who
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
do not agree with all the positions
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
taken by such advocacy groups HB 51
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
mandates the funding for such
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
memberships be identified specifically
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
in a warrant article for every city and
 
02:17:36.599 --> 02:17:37.610 align:start position:0%
in a warrant article for every city and
town

02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
but recall
 
02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
that citizens currently have the ability
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
to sponsor petitioned warrant articles
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
for consideration by local voters
 
02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
HP 51 is an overreach of the New
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature to mandate
 
02:17:58.969 --> 02:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of a specific warrant
 
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
article for municipal governing and
 
02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies to address
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
the Mandate undermines the current
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
process of local decisions of spending
 
02:18:11.089 --> 02:18:11.099 align:start position:0%
and policy that assures that each
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
municipality maintains the its unique
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
Community character
 
02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:19.139 align:start position:0%

02:18:39.950 --> 02:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
their policies and believes that their
 
02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
money their tax money should not be
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
um going towards that policy
 
02:18:47.399 --> 02:18:48.169 align:start position:0%
um going towards that policy
um

02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
under current law there's in in the fact
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
that they don't break down
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
um their efforts for training versus
 
02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:57.589 align:start position:0%
um their efforts for training versus
lobbying

02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:00.740 align:start position:0%
is there any way for the local
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
Warren article as you suggested to
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
defund the the
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um lobbying efforts while still allowing
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
them to uh Retreat
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
access the training that Municipal and
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
County government
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
um uh or Municipal Association currently
 
02:19:22.979 --> 02:19:24.469 align:start position:0%
um uh or Municipal Association currently
offers

02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
offers
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
and if not would this bill now allow or
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
Empower that voter to be able to have
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
that opportunity thank you the building
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
its current state does not allow that so
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
I I would have I'm only I'm answering a
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
question related to the current status
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill and what it says so to
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
answer your specific question about
 
02:19:45.599 --> 02:19:47.209 align:start position:0%
answer your specific question about
splitting

02:19:47.209 --> 02:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
splitting
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I would have to leave that to the
 
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
organizations to make that decision if
 
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
one citizen decided to do a petition
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
Warren article it would have to be
 
02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:55.010 align:start position:0%
Warren article it would have to be
addressed

02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's about all I could answer
 
02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
that's that's about all I could answer
that

02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.790 align:start position:0%
that
representative

02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you had stated in
 
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that um
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
State Statute allows a line item veto of
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
any particular budget item so
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
historically with regards to the the
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
town of New Boston have serving on you
 
02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:28.460 align:start position:0%
serving on the select board could you
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
provide us with examples in the past
 
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
say like five seven years where there
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
have been in fact an attempt to zero out
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
a particular line item in the budget and
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
did it pass thank you I apologize to
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
have to tell you that I really have only
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
been involved in this particular
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
position this is my second of three
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
years so during my tenure that has not
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
happened however during
 
02:20:59.690 --> 02:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
um budget meetings those questions
 
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
certainly do come up in terms of talking
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
about what the purpose of it is the
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
money spent but we've not had anybody uh
 
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
request that uh budget line item be
 
02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti thank you Mr
 
02:21:18.010 --> 02:21:18.020 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
honorable member cat for taking my
 
02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:22.010 align:start position:0%
honorable member cat for taking my
question

02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:25.309 --> 02:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned about advocacy and
 
02:21:28.929 --> 02:21:28.939 align:start position:0%
lobbying going kind of two sides of coin
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
in that sense so would this how would
 
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
in way of splitting it's almost seems
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
like a splitting hair so is that is it
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
the correct analogy or no
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm sorry I'm not sure I
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
understand your question sorry can I
 
02:21:58.490 --> 02:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
restate my question yes uh if you can
 
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
state it concisely and clearly please
 
02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:04.190 align:start position:0%
state it concisely and clearly please
okay

02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you alluded to the
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
term advocacy and lobbying so there are
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
some issues that you might approach the
 
02:22:19.690 --> 02:22:19.700 align:start position:0%
uh specific Association to lobby for
 
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
that on behalf of the voters the
 
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:25.370 align:start position:0%
that on behalf of the voters the
taxpayers

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
in some uh instances it could be an
 
02:22:31.490 --> 02:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
advocacy would you reach out to your
 
02:22:36.050 --> 02:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
local uh elected officials to advocate
 
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
um if I was acting in an official
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
capacity yes I would have a conversation
 
02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
with all of the leaders of all of the
 
02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
with all of the leaders of all of the
Departments

02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
Departments
 
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:53.210 align:start position:0%
Departments
um

02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we were all in the
 
02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.309 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we were all in the
same

02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:22:55.319 --> 02:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
same
page

02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
but you know I I think what we're
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
looking at here is the possibility of
 
02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
having well it actually isn't really a
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
possibility you look at all of the
 
02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
select boards uh and other elected
 
02:23:10.929 --> 02:23:10.939 align:start position:0%
officials who many have full-time jobs
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
they will not be sitting here
 
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
they will not be sitting here
um

02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:16.849 --> 02:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
talking about what their issues are
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
because they they actually ask someone
 
02:23:21.889 --> 02:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
else to do that for them
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but I can assure you that if there
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
are issues that we would disagree with
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
as a board that we felt was not good for
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
our citizens and that's what we're
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
elected to do
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
um then we would certainly let
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
um those organizations know that we are
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to what they're doing
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's our job
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:23:47.570 --> 02:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no more hands and I have no
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%

02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that this bill does
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
not eliminate the provision for a
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
special meeting it simply changes the
 
02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
current requirement of 50 registered
 
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.250 align:start position:0%
current requirement of 50 registered
voters

02:25:58.250 --> 02:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
and changing the number 50 to 10 percent
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the Town registered voters to bring
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
forward a petition the bill includes how
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
that 10 number is uh
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
is arrived at
 
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
it also keeps in place the requirement
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the signatures of at least 25
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
registered voters to move a
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
petition-worn article onto the March
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
town meeting ballot so that they're
 
02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
still relatively easy access to the
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
ballot uh occurring for any anybody in
 
02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
town who wants to petition
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
if I may I want to take a moment to
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%

you mentioned a number of you mentioned
 
02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
that this bill is a basically a
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
constituent request and you had listed
 
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
out a number of towns which I wasn't
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
able to to write down but my question is
 
02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:36.110 align:start position:0%
able to to write down but my question is
um

02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
with regards to those particular towns
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
that you cited how many special meetings
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
have these towns been petitioned to to
 
02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:45.110 align:start position:0%
have these towns been petitioned to to
have

02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:57.020 align:start position:0%
are there any others with questions
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to make it more difficult to
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
have a special town meeting
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
and is that and is that a good thing or
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
a bad thing
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
if it is so
 
02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
the it's really
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
the the thrust of this bill
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
was more focused on helping our town
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
officials conduct uh the election in
 
02:28:35.929 --> 02:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
March in a much more efficient way what
 
02:28:38.929 --> 02:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
happens is if there's if there's a
 
02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
special meeting requested and anytime
 
02:28:43.849 --> 02:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
outside of the period in the run-up to
 
02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
the uh March Town meetings
 
02:28:50.330 --> 02:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
you will hear some specifics on what it
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
costs Greenland to do this uh in terms
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
of real dollars and time and treasure
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
and energy and resources and that's
 
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
really what this is all about it's about
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
the uh distraction of of town P Town

I will defer that question if you don't
 
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
mind to the next speaker uh Mr Paul
 
02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
Sanderson who has some very specific
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
taking an additional question so um the
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
language of this bill it it's increasing
 
02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
the threshold to have with regards to
 
02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:09.410 align:start position:0%
the threshold to have with regards to
the

02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of signatures it's raising it to
 
02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:13.700 align:start position:0%
ten percent
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
where did this number come from
 
02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:22.220 align:start position:0%
to me it seems high
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh the that was a conversation that I
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
had with uh
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh Marge Morgan Our Town Clerk and
 
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
others uh in the town about where uh we
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
felt that would be a reasonable number
 
02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh there are
 
02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh there are
20

02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
completely sure
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
specifically how many registered voters
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
there are in Greenland it's around uh 25
 
02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.710 align:start position:0%
there are in Greenland it's around uh 25
2800

02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
2800
 
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
maybe 3 000. so uh it would give you
 
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
some idea of how many signatures we
 
02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
would need for a special meeting
 
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise you only need 25 for a special
 
02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
for a petition Warren article during the
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
town the March uh deliberative session
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
and town meeting it doesn't change that
 
02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
so if you really wanted to put an item
 
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
on the ballot you'd only need to get 25
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
signatures for the March meeting
 
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman and so
 
02:31:23.809 --> 02:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
with regards to the the language in this
 
02:31:29.090 --> 02:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill on lines 14 through 16. there the
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
pres current language is struck out so
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
it it makes two different categories in
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
towns with less than a thousand
 
02:31:40.370 --> 02:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
inhabitants there's one criteria and um
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
in towns with greater than ten thousand
 
02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
inhabitants there's uh the specification
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
of five percent so
 
02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:50.990 align:start position:0%
of five percent so
um

02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
why was were these two categories uh
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
struck in the language and therefore
 
02:32:01.090 --> 02:32:01.100 align:start position:0%
with the amended language
 
02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
regardless of how large or small a
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
particular municipality is
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's this requirement in the language
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill that
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
any municipality has the ten percent
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
could you ex speak to why this
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
distinction was is eliminated in The
 
02:32:21.050 --> 02:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question that's
 
02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question that's
uh

02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
when I presented this to uh OLS and
 
02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
asked them about what we wanted to try
 
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here uh that was the
 
02:32:37.849 --> 02:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
recommendation they made on drafting the
 
02:32:41.929 --> 02:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
bill to go this route and I uh just
 
02:32:44.450 --> 02:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
agreed to that in terms of what I used
 
02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
their experience in this to help move
 
02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:32:58.920 --> 02:32:59.809 align:start position:0%
my question
um

02:32:59.809 --> 02:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
I was wondering
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
is this the only way
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
that a special election can be called in
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
a town and kind of a follow-up if I may
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
add it to that at the same time no we do
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:18.830 align:start position:0%
uh
I

02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not an elections expert
 
02:33:21.479 --> 02:33:23.210 align:start position:0%
I'm not an elections expert
uh

02:33:23.210 --> 02:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
I that question may may be able to be
 
02:33:29.450 --> 02:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
answered by representative the gentleman
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
behind you is shaking his head no so I'm
 
02:33:32.330 --> 02:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
assuming he'll be able to answer yeah
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I didn't want to turn away from
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
you to uh yeah thank you my follow-up
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
was can a board of five call for a
 
02:33:42.530 --> 02:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
special meeting of a town that's why I
 
02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
was like the select board
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
again I will defer that question to uh
 
02:33:49.370 --> 02:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Sanderson thank you any further
 
02:33:51.050 --> 02:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:33:53.809 --> 02:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you so much
 
02:33:58.610 --> 02:33:58.620 align:start position:0%

first term in the house in 2012 and I
 
02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate your work it's complex and
 
02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
time consuming and I appreciate that

thank you very good uh next we do have I
 
02:34:10.010 --> 02:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
believe the gentleman standing sitting
 
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
behind you Paul Sanderson is that
 
02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:16.490 align:start position:0%
behind you Paul Sanderson is that
correct

02:34:16.490 --> 02:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:17.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Paul Sanderson I'm
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
currently serving as the Town
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
Administrator in the town of Greenland
 
02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
but I previously served on the select
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
board planning board Zoning Board of
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
adjustment and budget Committee in our
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
town over a period of the last 30 years
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
as well as serving as the moderator of
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the school district and moderator at the
 
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:38.060 align:start position:0%
town of various meetings
 
02:34:40.969 --> 02:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
during that period of time I also served
 
02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
for 10 years as a staff attorney at New
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association where I
 
02:34:47.210 --> 02:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
would be answering questions such as you
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
posed on a daily basis
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
so if I may start with some of the
 
02:34:53.290 --> 02:34:53.300 align:start position:0%
questions that you have already asked
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
the first question you asked is are
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
special meetings something that occurs
 
02:34:59.210 --> 02:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
every year no the answer is that they
 
02:35:00.889 --> 02:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
are relatively rare
 
02:35:02.929 --> 02:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
in answering the second question is this
 
02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
the only way that a special meeting can
 
02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
be called it's the way that the citizens
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
can seek uh that for a special meeting
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be called however the board of
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in a particular Town also have
 
02:35:15.730 --> 02:35:15.740 align:start position:0%
the ability to call a special meeting
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the consideration of questions but
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
there are significant statutory limits
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
that are imposed upon selectment because
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
usually it's about appropriating money
 
02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
or resending a particular appropriation
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I would refer you to RSA 31 colon 5
 
02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
which requires a finding by the superior
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
court that an emergency exists and that
 
02:35:40.969 --> 02:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
becomes the predicate towards calling a
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
special meeting unless for whatever
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
reason you would hope that one half of
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
the voters in your town would actually
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
be present in voting on the particular
 
02:35:49.969 --> 02:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
question something which is almost
 
02:35:52.429 --> 02:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
impossible to achieve
 
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh and so I believe those are the
 
02:35:56.690 --> 02:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
primary questions that have been asked
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
so far and I'm here really to support
 
02:36:01.370 --> 02:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
this legislation because it begins to
 
02:36:03.650 --> 02:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
provide a level of protection to towns
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
such as mine against uh special meetings
 
02:36:08.929 --> 02:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
that are called just to deal with a
 
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
particular question
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh in our case we had uh citizens in the
 
02:36:15.770 --> 02:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
community uh
 
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
seek a special meeting in order to ban
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
the use of voting machines it was an
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
election question that started in August
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
of 21 and by the time we had dealt with
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
that through the deliberative session
 
02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
and conducting an official ballot
 
02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
because we are an sb2 formatted town the
 
02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
entire amount of money that we spent is
 
02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 26 and 30 thousand
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
dollars to complete that particular
 
02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
dollars to complete that particular
process

02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony I've also tried
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
to point out to you that there is no
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
limitation in current law for the number
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
of times that citizens can do this
 
02:36:49.969 --> 02:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
during a particular year
 
02:36:51.889 --> 02:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
so that we could go from special meeting
 
02:36:54.410 --> 02:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
to special meeting to special meeting
 
02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
because there is very little in the way
 
02:36:58.849 --> 02:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
of legal standard that is contained in
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that would allow the board
 
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen to stop the process even if
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
the article seems on its face to be
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
particularly illegal
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
let me give you a hypothetical in that
 
02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
situation let's suppose that we conclude
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
our annual town meeting where a question
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
has come up about purchasing a fire
 
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
truck and the answer is in the negative
 
02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
and now we have people who really wanted
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
to have that fire truck uh petition to
 
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
by this application process to have a
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
special time meeting to consider the uh
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
purchase of a fire truck you would say
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
oh my well that can't be done because
 
02:37:37.250 --> 02:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
that would obviously be a new
 
02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that would violate RSA
 
02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
31.5 the answer to that is no the
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
selectman would not be able to stop the
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
process because in a deliberative
 
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
session the language of that particular
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
warrant article is amendable and could
 
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
remove that particular appropriation and
 
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
instead put in other forms of directives
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
before it was taken to the official
 
02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:58.070 align:start position:0%
before it was taken to the official
ballot

02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:38:01.610 --> 02:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
selectman right now under RSA 39 3 have
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
a difficult task because it in the in
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
the event they refuse to call that
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
special meeting they could be brought to
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
a circuit court and found guilty of a
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
violation fined personally and have
 
02:38:14.090 --> 02:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
money extracted for the benefit of the
 
02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:15.290 align:start position:0%
money extracted for the benefit of the
town

02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's in RSA 3913 and so that is why we
 
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
asked for representative malloy's help
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
to try to bring this issue forward to
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
show the vulnerability the towns have in
 
02:38:27.889 --> 02:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
this particular statute
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
and to ask for some form of Standards or
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
relief to make it more difficult for
 
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
those negative aspects to occur there
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
had been a question as well as to
 
02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
whether this can happen in cities the
 
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
answer is no this particular statute
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
applies only to towns so it applies to
 
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
towns that have a regular Town format
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
regular town meeting format or an sb2
 
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
format in the sb2 format the fiscal
 
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be larger due to the
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
bifurcation of the meetings between a
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and the need to
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
conduct an official ballot proceeding as
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to a town meeting where things
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
could be handled orally by either a
 
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
Voice vote or a written ballot conducted
 
02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
at one meeting
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh with that in mind I'd be happy to
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:17.389 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much for your
 
02:39:23.809 --> 02:39:23.819 align:start position:0%
testimony we have one final uh
 
02:39:28.370 --> 02:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Alice passer and I live in
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
Greenland thank you for the opportunity
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of this bill I was
 
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
involved in the effort to defeat this uh
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
special Warren article uh because it was
 
02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
harmful for our town and our town
 
02:39:51.469 --> 02:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
officials it so happens that this
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
special election that caused us to have
 
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
a vote with one question on it fell on
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Saturday before Christmas
 
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
we were happy that we defeated it on a
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
nine to one vote but I think the point
 
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
of this this bill is
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we we experienced uh how
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
costly this was and how few people in
 
02:40:19.969 --> 02:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
our town supported it we'd like to raise
 
02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
the the threshold whereby a special
 
02:40:25.490 --> 02:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
election could be triggered in a town
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
like ours because it was very very
 
02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:30.620 align:start position:0%
costly I could certainly imagine
 
02:40:33.490 --> 02:40:33.500 align:start position:0%
citizens having issues with our town
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
whereby a special election would be
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
warranted but
 
02:40:41.570 --> 02:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to see more more people in
 
02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
the town buy into this with the the 10
 
02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
percent uh 10 percent of signatures
 
02:40:49.730 --> 02:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
required in order to protect our town
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
from from you know time and and money
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
that was spent on on on this effort or
 
02:40:59.330 --> 02:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
to see somehow
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously this is not
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
changing for um for things added to our
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
town elections it will still be a low
 
02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
threshold of signatures uh for for a
 
02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
petitioned Warren article to be added to
 
02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
our town elections but we'd like to see
 
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
the trigger for a special election
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
changed thank you very much
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for

um been petitioned to to conduct this is
 
02:42:02.690 --> 02:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:10.849 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:10.859 align:start position:0%

02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
did you have a quota that you know this
 
02:43:26.570 --> 02:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
this States 10 of the registered voters
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to apply for the special meeting it
 
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
says nothing about how many people have
 
02:43:35.090 --> 02:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
I mean you could you could go with
 
02:43:40.969 --> 02:43:40.979 align:start position:0%
10 people excuse me representative I'm
 
02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm testifying go ahead
 
02:43:48.370 --> 02:43:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
was there a question I don't think so
 
02:43:55.070 --> 02:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
there was oh there was if you have
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
another question go ahead
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
well you know I I was just asking if
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
there was enough if you if you feel that
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's worth
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
having that the meeting to
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
with so few people
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
are they being represented
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
well it's my understanding
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
um if you know there was 10 of the
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
signatures to trigger a special meeting
 
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
and and then a special election uh
 
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully the people in the town would
 
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
be interested and show up for the
 
02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
special meeting
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.770 --> 02:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:44:35.690 --> 02:44:35.700 align:start position:0%

02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
and we will now open up the hearing on
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
HB 313 relative to the reduction from
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
the default budget per official budget
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative yokella you are up
 
02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.750 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you members

02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:37.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:39.309 --> 02:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
default budgets and this bill stemmed
 
02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:44.889 align:start position:0%
default budgets and this bill stemmed
from

02:45:44.889 --> 02:45:44.899 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
my attendance on my local municipal
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
budget committee and the fact that our
 
02:45:55.439 --> 02:45:56.630 align:start position:0%
budget committee and the fact that our
recent

02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
recent
 
02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:57.410 align:start position:0%
recent
um

02:45:57.410 --> 02:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:00.260 align:start position:0%
budget came
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
in significantly under the well a
 
02:46:06.770 --> 02:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand plus the proposed
 
02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
budget and so I asked the um
 
02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
the person that prepared the budget what
 
02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
was the main reason for the cause of the
 
02:46:20.650 --> 02:46:20.660 align:start position:0%
default budget being significantly under
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget and they said that
 
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
it was because of turnover
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
because under the current RSA if you
 
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
have for example an employee that is
 
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
hired for a hundred thousand dollars and
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
they leave the position and you hire a
 
02:46:42.010 --> 02:46:42.020 align:start position:0%
new person for fifty thousand dollars
 
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand dollars stays in
 
02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
the default budget even though the
 
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and everyone knows that
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
you only need fifty thousand dollars for
 
02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
but there's no way under our current law
 
02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
but there's no way under our current law
to

02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
um remove that extra fifty thousand
 
02:47:01.690 --> 02:47:01.700 align:start position:0%
dollars from the default budget
 
02:47:03.889 --> 02:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
artificially inflating that default
 
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:07.429 align:start position:0%
budget and
um

02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
so what I tried to do was to make it
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
clear that um so if the if the position
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
was completely eliminated and we got a
 
02:47:19.610 --> 02:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
new position
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
for that uh that would not be the whole
 
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
amount for the hundred thousand dollars
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
would be removed from the default budget
 
02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
and so that isn't really a a good
 
02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:32.030 align:start position:0%
and so that isn't really a a good
solution

02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
um to to essentially eliminate and
 
02:47:37.849 --> 02:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
recreate a new position
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
um and so this proposed language
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I have added to the default budget
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
language saying that any salary and
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
benefit reductions as part of position
 
02:47:51.889 --> 02:47:51.899 align:start position:0%
turnover which occur before the public
 
02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
meeting so you actually know that the
 
02:47:56.929 --> 02:47:56.939 align:start position:0%
person is hired it's not just that
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
you're you know someone left and the the
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
position is out for
 
02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're trying to hire
 
02:48:07.969 --> 02:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
someone you may need that flexibility of
 
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to hire the fifty thousand
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
dollar person or a seventy thousand
 
02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
dollar person or a hundred thousand
 
02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
dollar person
 
02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm just trying to limit it to
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the situations where you know you've
 
02:48:20.510 --> 02:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
already hired they've the so the
 
02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
contract is signed before the public
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearing that the new
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
um salary for that position and benefits
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
is at that quote fifty thousand dollar
 
02:48:32.929 --> 02:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
level like I just said in the example
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
um it's in the new budget at the fifty
 
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I think that it should
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
be reflected as as fifty thousand
 
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
dollars in the default budget in that
 
02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:43.070 align:start position:0%
dollars in the default budget in that
case

02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
some some places May
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
um have the interpretation that that
 
02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
this is already
 
02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:53.050 align:start position:0%
this is already
um

02:48:53.050 --> 02:48:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
required that this change is already
 
02:48:57.170 --> 02:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
required but
 
02:48:57.180 --> 02:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
required but
um

02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
based on the budget budget trainings or
 
02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
for default budget that I went to and
 
02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the law just doesn't specifically
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
state that you would need to reduce it
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
by that and so I'm just trying to
 
02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
clarify that and make sure that
 
02:49:16.250 --> 02:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
that these default budgets are are
 
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
appropriate for what is needed for the
 
02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
town to run so thank you for the
 
02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:21.290 align:start position:0%
town to run so thank you for the
question

02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this bill
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
my question pertains to the the amended
 
02:49:35.809 --> 02:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
language on line 13. and specifically
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the adjective Municipal
 
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
in relation to budget committee
 
02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
so under RSA 3214
 
02:49:49.730 --> 02:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
it specifies an official budget
 
02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
committee and we also some
 
02:49:53.929 --> 02:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
municipalities have advisory budget
 
02:49:56.450 --> 02:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
committees or Finance committees which
 
02:49:58.210 --> 02:49:58.220 align:start position:0%
has no statutory
 
02:50:02.809 --> 02:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
Authority and that's under 32 colon 24.
 
02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
so my question is well why
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
are you what is meant by Municipal
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
budget Committee in in
 
02:50:14.450 --> 02:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
do you want to have this ability
 
02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:15.170 align:start position:0%
do you want to have this ability
um

02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:17.690 --> 02:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
for either a budget committee or a
 
02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee and additionally
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
in municipalities that do not have
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
either then that budget belongs to the
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
governing body which would be the select
 
02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
board or the school board so would you
 
02:50:36.889 --> 02:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
also would it be better to include that
 
02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
provisional language if
 
02:50:41.290 --> 02:50:41.300 align:start position:0%
none of those
 
02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
finance budget committees exist thank
 
02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:46.690 align:start position:0%
finance budget committees exist thank
you

02:50:46.690 --> 02:50:46.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
um for allowing me to address the
 
02:50:58.370 --> 02:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment is not my
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that is a
 
02:51:04.610 --> 02:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
another person's amendment that um that
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think should be considered on its own
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
merits whether or not it should be
 
02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
merits whether or not it should be
adopted

02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
um it is that the member is here and
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
will testify to that uh Amendment
 
02:51:19.610 --> 02:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
02:51:21.889 --> 02:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
um the lack of clarity in default
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
budgets is pervasive and
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the member uh has their own story
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
about their own time on their budget
 
02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
committee and the the struggles that
 
02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
they had and wanted a vehicle for being
 
02:51:40.809 --> 02:51:40.819 align:start position:0%
able to amend this this statute and
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
since my my bill is on the statute
 
02:51:47.330 --> 02:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
already they uh it's a germane Amendment
 
02:51:48.770 --> 02:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
um they were able to offer it and they
 
02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to
 
02:51:55.309 --> 02:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
their Amendment and we can choose to
 
02:52:02.590 --> 02:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:52:09.230 --> 02:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
I just
 
02:52:12.050 --> 02:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
um it's I think one of the last things
 
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
you said about the bill when we talk
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the line previous to the one in
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
bold so I guess that would be line seven
 
02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
where it talks about salaries and
 
02:52:20.570 --> 02:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
benefits positions that have been
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
eliminated I'm curious if you could
 
02:52:27.610 --> 02:52:27.620 align:start position:0%
restate for me or or how your language
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
enhances that or is it different because
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not I'm not quite sure what
 
02:52:33.769 --> 02:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
the difference is between eliminated and
 
02:52:33.779 --> 02:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
the difference is between eliminated and
turnover

02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
02:52:38.279 --> 02:52:40.010 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
um

02:52:40.010 --> 02:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
so eliminated is is
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
um completely gone from the budget like
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
Struck from the budget you have you know
 
02:52:50.809 --> 02:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
employee maintenance manager and no now
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
you just have maintenance employee and
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating the manager position
 
02:52:57.889 --> 02:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hire a different
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
position that would be eliminating but
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you had a manager and then the
 
02:53:04.490 --> 02:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
manager left and you're just hiring on
 
02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
another manager that's turnover and so
 
02:53:10.370 --> 02:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
so right now under current law If you
 
02:53:12.050 --> 02:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you know the maintenance manager
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
position and just strike it entirely
 
02:53:17.090 --> 02:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
that will be removed from the default
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
budget but if you happen to have
 
02:53:22.250 --> 02:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
currently have a d uh you know a
 
02:53:25.730 --> 02:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
maintenance manager that's hired at 75
 
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
000 and then you have turnover in your
 
02:53:30.290 --> 02:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
new higher your new uh maintenance
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
manager is only at fifty thousand there
 
02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
would that would not be currently
 
02:53:36.349 --> 02:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
reflected in the default budget and I'm
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
just trying to have that be able to be
 
02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:39.950 align:start position:0%
just trying to have that be able to be
reflected

02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
reflected
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:51.889 --> 02:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:53:54.889 --> 02:53:54.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question and you should you're
 
02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be commended to try to do anything to
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
make any clarity as you said into about
 
02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
a default budget I think I understated
 
02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:06.779 align:start position:0%
it when you said that there was it was
 
02:54:09.769 --> 02:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity would uh
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh well you know you you don't have the
 
02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
the Amendments so we have to talk about
 
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bill uh
 
02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
I would say that the only question I
 
02:54:24.170 --> 02:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
have is uh
 
02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
have is uh
is

02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line 10 is that
 
02:54:34.849 --> 02:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh is that a change in the uh in the
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendment too it says shall we
 
02:54:41.090 --> 02:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
Appropriations not likely to recur which
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
opens Pandora's Box means it can be
 
02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
anything representative that is current
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
language is that is that in in the
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment strike it
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is that is the amendment that is
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
not my language and so I I suggest that
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
you ask those the questions regarding
 
02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
um not likely to occur and all that for
 
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
the member that's that wants to amend
 
02:55:06.889 --> 02:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
the discount thank you I will do that
 
02:55:11.929 --> 02:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.969 --> 02:55:13.979 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:55:15.769 --> 02:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
02:55:17.929 --> 02:55:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative Yokel I'd like to
 
02:55:20.570 --> 02:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
apologize for my confusion I have too
 
02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
many sheets in front of me and I have
 
02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
notes and I went to the wrong sheet so I
 
02:55:29.210 --> 02:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
apologize for speaking to the amendment
 
02:55:31.730 --> 02:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
which we're not dealing with right now
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative majority you had to
 
02:55:36.170 --> 02:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
follow it thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking a
 
02:55:39.050 --> 02:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up so this is just for my clarity
 
02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
again so the position
 
02:55:45.889 --> 02:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
turnover if that position is unfilled
 
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
it still can REM it it's in transition
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
it has been posted at maybe a less than
 
02:55:55.370 --> 02:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
what it had originally been filled we're
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
still good to leave it as such correct
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah under my under this language
 
02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
the the turnover has to occur before the
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing the actual like if you
 
02:56:11.210 --> 02:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
post because just because you posted at
 
02:56:12.889 --> 02:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars even though it
 
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
was previously 75 doesn't mean you're
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to be able to fill it and so maybe
 
02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
you're gonna need to repost it at 75
 
02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
once no one applies for it right so
 
02:56:22.490 --> 02:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
we'll want to leave that flexibility
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
open while there's still kind of you're
 
02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
in this limbo zone of not having
 
02:56:28.730 --> 02:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
employment but once you've filled that
 
02:56:30.650 --> 02:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
and signed on the dotted line that
 
02:56:32.929 --> 02:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
turnover has occurred before the public
 
02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
hearing so thank you any further
 
02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
hearing so thank you any further
questions

02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative yokella next week call
 
02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
02:57:07.969 --> 02:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak here today uh my
 
02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
name is representative sellers I
 
02:57:12.170 --> 02:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton 18 which is at uh
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
flutorial including all 10 towns in
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
southern Grafton
 
02:57:21.290 --> 02:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
I won't list the towns but in any case
 
02:57:24.769 --> 02:57:24.779 align:start position:0%
um I support this
 
02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 313
 
02:57:31.010 --> 02:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
and as I noticed that it was going in
 
02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
and as I noticed that it was going in
for

02:57:32.150 --> 02:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh as a House Bill I said oh this is a
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
good time to maybe help get some clarity
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
to the RSA 4013 9 lowercase b
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm trying to do here is
 
02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
bring some clarity and understanding
 
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
because I've been on the town budget
 
02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
committee and also the school board
 
02:57:57.530 --> 02:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
budget committee and I've seen how the
 
02:57:58.969 --> 02:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
budget committees work and experienced
 
02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
them firsthand for at least six years
 
02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:02.530 align:start position:0%
them firsthand for at least six years
now

02:58:02.530 --> 02:58:02.540 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to do is two things
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
here one is to turn allow the budget
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
committee if there is a budget committee
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
to determine what a one-time expense is
 
02:58:17.809 --> 02:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:58:17.819 --> 02:58:19.309 align:start position:0%
all right
the

02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
second part of this or might be reversed
 
02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
but the second part is
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
defining which year from last year to
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
next year's but because believe it or
 
02:58:33.170 --> 02:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
not there's confusion
 
02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
there's actually confusion and what you
 
02:58:39.410 --> 02:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
have is we we get it in uh from the SAU
 
02:58:41.809 --> 02:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
that the uh well that's not going to
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
happen next year but it might happen in
 
02:58:46.490 --> 02:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
a year from now or two years from now so
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
we get that type of language from the
 
02:58:48.479 --> 02:58:50.630 align:start position:0%
we get that type of language from the
SAU

02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
02:58:53.090 --> 02:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that just by putting this uh
 
02:58:54.650 --> 02:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
additional language in will actually
 
02:58:58.490 --> 02:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
help some to clear up this RSA because
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually kind of vague when it
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
comes to one-time expenses we have for
 
02:59:05.210 --> 02:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
an example
 
02:59:08.210 --> 02:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
um they put in a floor buffer a ten
 
02:59:09.889 --> 02:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar floor buffer which is
 
02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
going to be replaced once every 10 years
 
02:59:13.849 --> 02:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
and they know it's going to be replaced
 
02:59:15.769 --> 02:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
once in every 10 years but it's in the
 
02:59:18.230 --> 02:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
budget and they leave that ten thousand
 
02:59:21.530 --> 02:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
dollar flow buffer in there you have
 
02:59:24.889 --> 02:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
um risers for the for the choir or the
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
of course I say quiet excuse me of
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
course but in kitties in that case there
 
02:59:31.490 --> 02:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know that's another 20 to 25 000
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
budget item which they know is going to
 
02:59:36.290 --> 02:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
last again for another 15 to 25 years
 
02:59:39.670 --> 02:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
but it's left in the budget because this
 
02:59:43.610 --> 02:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
RSA is vague and what happens we end up
 
02:59:46.490 --> 02:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
going back and forth and what they do is
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
get their Council involved which ends up
 
02:59:52.130 --> 02:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
costing the school district
 
02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
actually more money at that point so I'm
 
02:59:55.969 --> 02:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
not going to go on from there I just
 
02:59:58.250 --> 02:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
want to Simply bring this forward if
 
03:00:00.170 --> 03:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
this is the exact language that's used
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
going forward fantastic if you find that
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
a it needs to be cleared up even a
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more awesome I just want to
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
bring It Forward I'll take any questions
 
03:00:11.570 --> 03:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sellers are
 
03:00:13.550 --> 03:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
 
03:00:13.560 --> 03:00:16.010 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
Guthrie

03:00:16.010 --> 03:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
Guthrie
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:00:23.929 --> 03:00:23.939 align:start position:0%
question uh is this a method of having
 
03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
more eyes and more confusion in trying
 
03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
to determine which items should go in or
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
out of the default budget
 
03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question the
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
the only eyes that are on this at this
 
03:00:43.849 --> 03:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
point here would be the elected budget
 
03:00:46.490 --> 03:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
committee or the select board slash
 
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
either School Board which would be
 
03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
looking at these one-time expenditures
 
03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
so they are listed in the uh as
 
03:00:56.990 --> 03:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures as far as breakouts and how
 
03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
much they are so it's just their job as
 
03:01:02.809 --> 03:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
elected officials they're supposed to be
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
looking at these but the problem is is
 
03:01:07.969 --> 03:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
determining is oh that's not a one-time
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
expense this one is and then you end up
 
03:01:12.349 --> 03:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
getting counsel in there and then you
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
end up spending more money for the
 
03:01:16.250 --> 03:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
district so we're trying to we're trying
 
03:01:19.010 --> 03:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
to just get it to whatever the budget
 
03:01:21.290 --> 03:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee says or the select board if
 
03:01:22.730 --> 03:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
there is no budget committee or School
 
03:01:26.750 --> 03:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
Board their their word is final
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr fewman follow up uh and
 
03:01:31.969 --> 03:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
just question pretty much the same
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
question but I guess is this just too
 
03:01:37.969 --> 03:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
many cooks I mean this is a very
 
03:01:41.809 --> 03:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
vague area on the Senate Bill 2 was
 
03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
awful that we even put it in but we have
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
it now that we have it isn't it better
 
03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
to have somebody do it as an
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
administrative item and then in the in
 
03:01:54.769 --> 03:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
the uh deliberative session uh that's
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
the time to take a look if anybody wants
 
03:02:00.530 --> 03:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
to take a look at how the default was
 
03:02:02.570 --> 03:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
was determined
 
03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
I guess that is a possibility in the
 
03:02:07.010 --> 03:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
deliberative session on asb2 absolutely
 
03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
and of course that Tom meeting and every
 
03:02:11.570 --> 03:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
time you go to town meeting it's it's a
 
03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
bottom line budget so always keep that
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
in mind and and still this would still
 
03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
be a bottom line budget so even though
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
you might want a saying this is a
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
actually I take that back the default
 
03:02:26.090 --> 03:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
budget cannot be changed this is the
 
03:02:28.610 --> 03:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
default budget so when you go in sb2 you
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
can only talk about the proposed budget
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
I can appreciate that so it just seemed
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
to me that we have too many cooks
 
03:02:39.710 --> 03:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
already looking at uh regular questions
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answers
 
03:02:45.410 --> 03:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much
 
03:02:47.570 --> 03:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you all uh
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:01.010 --> 03:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and the rest
 
03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Scott gross
 
03:03:04.490 --> 03:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
I am the business administrator for
 
03:03:07.210 --> 03:03:07.220 align:start position:0%
sau19 which is Goffstown and New Boston
 
03:03:11.450 --> 03:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to oppose the bill the way
 
03:03:14.210 --> 03:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
it's written and offer some hopefully
 
03:03:16.130 --> 03:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
some clarification for you as someone
 
03:03:17.929 --> 03:03:17.939 align:start position:0%
who is in the trenches who has to
 
03:03:20.690 --> 03:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
prepare uh the default budget I did
 
03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
bring goffstown's default budget with me
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
um essentially I'm here to discuss just
 
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
some of the mechanics of preparing the
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
default budget and budgets in general we
 
03:03:35.690 --> 03:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
start our process in July but a lot of
 
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
the heavy lifting starts in September so
 
03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that I had and I'm
 
03:03:42.650 --> 03:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
so glad that representative vocella uh
 
03:03:45.230 --> 03:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
articulated what what the premise is the
 
03:03:48.290 --> 03:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
rationale behind the bill all I was
 
03:03:51.230 --> 03:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
seeking was to give us a better timeline
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
so whenever you do budgets or financials
 
03:03:57.290 --> 03:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
you have to do a snapshot in time our
 
03:03:59.210 --> 03:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time is typically in
 
03:04:02.929 --> 03:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
September so contrary to when some folks
 
03:04:05.929 --> 03:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
were saying that
 
03:04:07.969 --> 03:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
you want to go all the way up to the
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
public hearing for us it's probably
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
about 90 days before that public hearing
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
where we take that snapshot in time and
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
in that snapshot in time if we had staff
 
03:04:18.650 --> 03:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
turnover we're taking the current
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
incumbent in that role let's say on
 
03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
September 1st or 15th whatever it may be
 
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the number that we use now I
 
03:04:28.969 --> 03:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
recognize that the default budget is
 
03:04:31.250 --> 03:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
contentious that it is interpreted
 
03:04:33.290 --> 03:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
differently from municipality to
 
03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
municipality from school to school
 
03:04:36.650 --> 03:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
district I tend to take a more
 
03:04:38.690 --> 03:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
conservative approach to the default
 
03:04:40.130 --> 03:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
budget having served on budget
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
committees select boards and school
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
boards I served on all of those I tend
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
to take a more conservative approach but
 
03:04:48.889 --> 03:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
what I would would say is that we need
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
we need more of a snapshot the whole
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
rolling trying to it's so hard to do
 
03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
these budgets I I'm responsible for over
 
03:04:59.330 --> 03:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
70 million dollars of budgets and to
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
worry about I have to worry you go all
 
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
the way to say a public hearing date
 
03:05:05.090 --> 03:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
which was recently a couple of weeks ago
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
to then adjust all these numbers and
 
03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
then get it on the warrant and it is
 
03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
just really challenging so I would offer
 
03:05:16.910 --> 03:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
a friendly suggestion to maybe perhaps
 
03:05:19.490 --> 03:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
say 90 days prior to your public hearing
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
is you take that snapshot in time the
 
03:05:23.570 --> 03:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
other one thing that I thought was
 
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
interesting was that to me the default
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
budget needs to be fair and I was a
 
03:05:30.889 --> 03:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
little taken aback by any salary and
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
benefit reductions as part of the
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
position it should be changes sometimes
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's a positive where you have to
 
03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
adjust your your default budget so um so
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know with that I just again mine was
 
03:05:45.710 --> 03:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
more of the mechanics of somebody who
 
03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
has to do it day in and day out and
 
03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
speaking with my peers who are fellow
 
03:05:52.010 --> 03:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
business administrators
 
03:05:52.020 --> 03:05:52.670 align:start position:0%
business administrators
um

03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:55.250 --> 03:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
it the timelines are just so so
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
challenging and we're under the gun to
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
get to meet all these deadlines and
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements so unless there
 
03:06:03.050 --> 03:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
are any questions that that was really
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
my point today
 
03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative and sure thank you Mr
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
question which I hope is a quick one I'm
 
03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the select board in my town
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
the select board sets the default budget
 
03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
it does the school board set their
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question in uh in
 
03:06:28.130 --> 03:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
my town uh which is Goffstown they do I
 
03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
would also
 
03:06:29.460 --> 03:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
would also
um

03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:34.490 --> 03:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
state that in this other Amendment where
 
03:06:37.010 --> 03:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
the other Amendment says
 
03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:37.550 align:start position:0%
the other Amendment says
um

03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to make your adjustments as
 
03:06:42.230 --> 03:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
determined by the municipal budget
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee that's a bit of a
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
contradiction to RSA 40 colon 14b in my
 
03:06:51.170 --> 03:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
town there was a an article to have the
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
budget committee set the default budget
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it was it was defeated and I I think
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that's another one that there's a
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
lot of conflict there because if the
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
municipality or School District wants
 
03:07:05.929 --> 03:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
the budget committee to set the default
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
budget then they're going to vote to do
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
that what this does is it kind of parses
 
03:07:12.170 --> 03:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
that out and it allows them to determine
 
03:07:15.050 --> 03:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
what's a one-time expenditure and what's
 
03:07:17.389 --> 03:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
not and as an example you know this is
 
03:07:20.330 --> 03:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
mine so for Goffstown and I'll give you
 
03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
a good example we did a Windows we did
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
some windows replacement that was a
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
one-time expenditure and I put reduced
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
based upon one-time expenditure there
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
was another one we had to do a ten
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar cistern inspection at
 
03:07:35.809 --> 03:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
our Middle School took it off uh because
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
it was not going to be reoccurring so so
 
03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
utilities I take a conservative approach
 
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
if the price of propane or electricity
 
03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
goes up that's new spending for me I
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
know others may be different but and I
 
03:07:50.809 --> 03:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
know I recognize the fact that it is
 
03:07:52.370 --> 03:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
vague but
 
03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
I take more conservative approach and um
 
03:07:57.889 --> 03:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
I I think that in this case
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
um long-winded answer I think the Local
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
School Board of municipality My Town set
 
03:08:05.210 --> 03:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
that default budget but we do have to
 
03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
share it and we share it at public
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
hearing by the way not at deliberative
 
03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
the statute says that you have to share
 
03:08:14.030 --> 03:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
your um your your default budget at
 
03:08:15.410 --> 03:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
public hearing and that's another thing
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
is that I set this thing and the board
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
votes on it typically in December of
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
every year so that we can then you know
 
03:08:24.050 --> 03:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
give it to the give it to the um the
 
03:08:25.730 --> 03:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
voters put it on our website so it's
 
03:08:27.769 --> 03:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
very transparent public trust is so
 
03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
important and this is all about our
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
integrity with the numbers and if you
 
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
don't have that public trust people
 
03:08:36.290 --> 03:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
don't support you on your budgets
 
03:08:39.050 --> 03:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
slipping and saying my name
 
03:08:46.490 --> 03:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question what
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of your budget is personnel
 
03:08:52.490 --> 03:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
which could be fluctuating
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
um for me and say let's say Goffstown
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
and New Boston it's about 75 give or
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
take but it in school districts that's
 
03:09:03.230 --> 03:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
typically the case it's 70 80 percent is
 
03:09:05.929 --> 03:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
highly salary and benefits on the
 
03:09:07.730 --> 03:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
municipal side so when I was on the
 
03:09:09.769 --> 03:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen select board now they
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
call it
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
um it was far less because you have much
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
greater Capital costs you know your
 
03:09:16.730 --> 03:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
roads Bridges
 
03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
um probably more like 50 60 percent is
 
03:09:22.490 --> 03:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
so um again it varies from town to town
 
03:09:24.590 --> 03:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it varies based upon town or School
 
03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:28.870 align:start position:0%
and it varies based upon town or School
District

03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
03:09:33.410 --> 03:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
um as I said before I live in a city so
 
03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is Greek To Me
 
03:09:40.740 --> 03:09:42.490 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is Greek To Me
um

03:09:42.490 --> 03:09:42.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:46.130 --> 03:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
but I'm struck by the professionalism
 
03:09:48.650 --> 03:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
with which you bring
 
03:09:52.010 --> 03:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
to your budget process and I'm thinking
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
that this is a level of professionalism
 
03:09:56.990 --> 03:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that all towns should rightfully
 
03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
expect of their budget officers and
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
other professionals that they hire in
 
03:10:04.910 --> 03:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
this field I'm less convinced that it's
 
03:10:08.090 --> 03:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
the job of the State Legislature
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
to get into the business of policing how
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
professional that process is
 
03:10:17.090 --> 03:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative is there a question in
 
03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:18.050 align:start position:0%
representative is there a question in
there

03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:10:20.929 --> 03:10:20.939 align:start position:0%
a good question Mr chair I hear no
 
03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions would you would you say that
 
03:10:27.889 --> 03:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
this is more of a a matter of
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
how different professionals carry out
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
their jobs in all of New Hampshire's
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
towns as opposed to what's written in
 
03:10:40.250 --> 03:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
state law about how budgets are created
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
it does but I believe it's a difficult
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
question to answer
 
03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I believe that everyone has different
 
03:10:52.969 --> 03:10:52.979 align:start position:0%
opinions on things and uh opinions
 
03:10:54.769 --> 03:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
that's why there are lawyers
 
03:10:56.750 --> 03:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
because they interpret statute and what
 
03:10:58.250 --> 03:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
what they mean
 
03:11:00.530 --> 03:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
um that being said I do agree with you
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
that business officials business
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
administrators like myself
 
03:11:09.070 --> 03:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
um do take this very seriously and
 
03:11:09.080 --> 03:11:10.190 align:start position:0%
um do take this very seriously and
[Music]

03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's also discussed in public session
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
just so that folks understand the
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
default budget again I can't speak for
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
my peers but I present the default
 
03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
budget so I prepare it for my school
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
board I don't sign this is by penalty of
 
03:11:29.450 --> 03:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
perjury I don't sign it my school board
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
does I have to explain and we go through
 
03:11:34.610 --> 03:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
it I might give them 20 to
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
20 items that are basically in my
 
03:11:40.490 --> 03:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
opinion this is a default item in my
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
opinion this is new spending and
 
03:11:44.809 --> 03:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes I would say ninety percent of
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
the time if not more they agree with my
 
03:11:48.650 --> 03:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
my assessment but at the end of the day
 
03:11:51.710 --> 03:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's the governing body who then signs
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
this and there have been times where
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
um they have said no I I don't think
 
03:11:58.969 --> 03:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
that is new spending we believe it's
 
03:12:02.929 --> 03:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
default and they take a vote and I
 
03:12:05.330 --> 03:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
change it on the form I mean it it's
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
happened but it's happened rarely thank
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Galler
 
03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:11.090 align:start position:0%

03:12:19.150 --> 03:12:19.160 align:start position:0%

03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
go a bit more into the um amendment that
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative sellers proposed to this
 
03:12:34.429 --> 03:12:34.439 align:start position:0%

Amendment

03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.690 --> 03:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm speaking
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
answering it's this one
 
03:12:49.859 --> 03:12:52.330 align:start position:0%
answering it's this one
yeah

03:12:52.330 --> 03:12:52.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:12:55.969 --> 03:12:55.979 align:start position:0%
2023.0059h yeah I I believe I believe
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
from sitting in the audience that the
 
03:12:59.330 --> 03:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
intentions of the representative
 
03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill the amendments are
 
03:13:02.090 --> 03:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
kind of noble ones they're trying to
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
clarify it I just don't know if it if
 
03:13:06.830 --> 03:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
the second one or even the first one
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
actually does that
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that being said you know if this
 
03:13:13.250 --> 03:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee uh does believe that an
 
03:13:14.809 --> 03:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
amendment is needed for this particular
 
03:13:17.570 --> 03:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
statute all I'm asking is that you make
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
two considerations uh consider a
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
timeline please do not go all the way to
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that is just a an
 
03:13:27.230 --> 03:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
Abomination it would be so challenging
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:13:31.490 --> 03:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um make it 90 days 120 days to set that
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and and also factor in that
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
default budgets go up and down so it's
 
03:13:37.490 --> 03:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
not just reductions it could be just be
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
changes so that those are the two things
 
03:13:41.809 --> 03:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:41.819 --> 03:13:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:13:43.490 --> 03:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
03:13:49.730 --> 03:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
question have you ever had a budget uh
 
03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
refused that you had in by your town so
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
that they had to use your default budget
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
I have been in this world no place okay
 
03:14:04.969 --> 03:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
that would be yes in Goffstown no in my
 
03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
four and a half years of doing this job
 
03:14:09.769 --> 03:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%

very much last uh pink card I have
nature

03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:20.210 --> 03:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Grace for the
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we do oppose
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
this bill but I do want to thank the the
 
03:14:27.769 --> 03:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor for reaching out and
 
03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
speaking with us
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
um this is incredibly complex area of of
 
03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:33.050 align:start position:0%
um this is incredibly complex area of of
law

03:14:33.050 --> 03:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:14:35.690 --> 03:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
um I do want to address two things uh
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
very briefly
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
um won the proposed amendment
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
um representative Guthrie asked a
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
question about that
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
basically that just illustrates the
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
Perpetual struggle between the budget
 
03:14:52.490 --> 03:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
committee and governing body
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
um that's that's just my opinion of it
 
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and secondly there was a discussion
 
03:15:01.010 --> 03:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
about the term reductions in line 10 I
 
03:15:03.170 --> 03:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
mean whether that should be changes and
 
03:15:04.670 --> 03:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
we at the municipal Association get in
 
03:15:07.130 --> 03:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
trouble quite frequently because we have
 
03:15:09.889 --> 03:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
to explain to uh Municipal officials
 
03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
that inflationary costs
 
03:15:14.769 --> 03:15:14.779 align:start position:0%
um including
 
03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
raises that are on separate warrant
 
03:15:19.490 --> 03:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
articles do not qualify as a reoccurring
 
03:15:21.230 --> 03:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
costs and therefore could not be
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
included in the default budget so those
 
03:15:26.450 --> 03:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
those amounts should not go up
 
03:15:28.370 --> 03:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so I I know that representative
 
03:15:31.010 --> 03:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
yokella is not here but we had a very
 
03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
extensive discussion about that term so
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure that I made the
 
03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
committee aware of that
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
and that's how I had
 
03:15:39.230 --> 03:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:41.570 --> 03:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
Graves for taking my question so it my
 
03:15:49.130 --> 03:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
question I'm not going to restate my
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
misplaced question of the Prime sponsor
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
but it pertains to line 13 and the use
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the word Municipal budget committee
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
um do you see any concerns with that
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
language and if so what would you
 
03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:03.910 align:start position:0%
language and if so what would you
suggest

03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
might be a change to clarify to make it
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
more clear what's going on there and
 
03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:09.530 align:start position:0%
more clear what's going on there and
what

03:16:09.530 --> 03:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
so intention is at at the risk of
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
getting myself in trouble it might be
 
03:16:18.050 --> 03:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a study committee on
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
the term default budget to clarify this
 
03:16:22.490 --> 03:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph
 
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
um but as far as the as far as line 13
 
03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:27.410 align:start position:0%
um but as far as the as far as line 13
goes

03:16:27.410 --> 03:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
goes
 
03:16:27.420 --> 03:16:28.130 align:start position:0%
goes
um

03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:30.889 --> 03:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
the default budgets determined by the
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
select board or the governing body in in
 
03:16:33.479 --> 03:16:35.570 align:start position:0%
select board or the governing body in in
municipalities

03:16:35.570 --> 03:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
um so the issue here would be that
 
03:16:41.210 --> 03:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
struggle between the the budget
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
committee and the select board
 
03:16:45.849 --> 03:16:45.859 align:start position:0%
where the budget committee would now be
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
determining what may be a reoccurring
 
03:16:51.469 --> 03:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
expense rather than it being the select
 
03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
board so
 
03:16:57.070 --> 03:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's the conflict
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%

ready here we go so there's the
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
background for this bill this may seem
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
like it's going off topic but you'll
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
understand as I go along
 
03:42:01.130 --> 03:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
I am the chair of the Osby Board of
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
Selectmen Ossipee has repeatedly granted
 
03:42:05.690 --> 03:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions to the Ossipee
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
Masonic Lodge for decades against the
 
03:42:10.490 --> 03:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
advice of the assessor this practice is
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
illegal the Masonic Lodge does not
 
03:42:15.650 --> 03:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
qualify for an exemption the assessor in
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
the meeting stated that the Selectmen
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
could Grant a good cause abatement
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
a motion was made to Grant the property
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
tax exemption I voted against it the
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
other two board members voted for it
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
this was in a public meeting
 
03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
some residents then filed the grievings
 
03:42:33.710 --> 03:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of tax and land appeals
 
03:42:36.170 --> 03:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
better known as btla and that hearing
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
was scheduled
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
the hearing occurred on January 24 2022
 
03:42:42.889 --> 03:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
after this hearing the Department of
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue dra issued a report by Philip
 
03:42:48.530 --> 03:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
Bodwell dra assessor which defined good
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
cause to mean assessment and valuation
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
errors or hardship
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
the report also stated that good cause
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
abatements are discouraged and not
 
03:42:58.610 --> 03:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
recommended to be used to circumvent
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
another law meaning if an organization
 
03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
does not qualify for a property tax
 
03:43:03.540 --> 03:43:04.729 align:start position:0%
does not qualify for a property tax
exemption

03:43:04.729 --> 03:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
you should not then issue an abatement
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
the property tax exemption issued to the
 
03:43:13.250 --> 03:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
Masonic Lodge was overturned by the btla
 
03:43:15.410 --> 03:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
and an order was issued for the Masonic
 
03:43:17.809 --> 03:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
laws to pay back taxes
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
even though dra defined good cause to
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
mean assessment or evaluation errors or
 
03:43:25.849 --> 03:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
hardship this is still ambiguous and not
 
03:43:28.250 --> 03:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
clearly defined this is why my bill
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
changes good cause to administrative or
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
clerical errors and poverty as
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
determined by federal guidelines on
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
December 31st in the calendar year
 
03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
preceding April 1st
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
I also Define that this law cannot be
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
used to circumvent RSA 72 this pertains
 
03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
to exemptions this still gives the
 
03:43:49.130 --> 03:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
municipality the flexibility but clearly
 
03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
defines the law this makes government
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
efficient transparent and accountable
 
03:43:56.330 --> 03:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
the only reason this illegal Masonic
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
exemption came to the public meeting is
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
because I insisted not be done in a
 
03:44:03.010 --> 03:44:03.020 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting on the RSA
 
03:44:06.530 --> 03:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
91a32c reputational risks such as Tax
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
Matters this is where unfortunately
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
these discussions occur outside of the
 
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
public view this is corruption clear and
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
simple there are two core cases that
 
03:44:18.410 --> 03:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
show how clearly good cause abatements
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
were abused and overturned town of
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
Seabrook docket number
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
26624-120s and the city of Berlin docket
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
nhma opposes this bill simply because it
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
diminishes in their view the authority
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities they represent a
 
03:44:39.530 --> 03:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
bill should either be opposed or
 
03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
supported based on the merits of this
 
03:44:44.210 --> 03:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
bill not who pays membership dues if you
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
believe in accountability transparency
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
and a government free of corruption and
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
nepotism this bill if it becomes law
 
03:44:53.450 --> 03:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
brings us one step closer to fulfilling
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
this obligation I just want to add also
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
I emailed the whole committee because I
 
03:44:59.570 --> 03:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
didn't want to print out 100 sheets of
 
03:45:02.030 --> 03:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
paper I have them here for for viewing
 
03:45:03.889 --> 03:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
is the town of Seabrook case showing how
 
03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
good cause abatements again ambiguous
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
and not clearly defined was abused the
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
Berlin case here that was index clearly
 
03:45:13.130 --> 03:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
showing how good cause abatements were
 
03:45:14.690 --> 03:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
abused and I also have the Bodwell
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
report which lays out the Ossipee case
 
03:45:20.090 --> 03:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
and how they Define good cause
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
abatements so in this packet you'll see
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
the original bill was just for
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
administrative or clerical errors
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
my mind is always thinking and trying to
 
03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
figure ways to improve this to cover you
 
03:45:34.250 --> 03:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
know more various ways to Grant the
 
03:45:36.610 --> 03:45:36.620 align:start position:0%
abatement so I I included in the second
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
abatement excuse me the second
 
03:45:39.420 --> 03:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
abatement excuse me the second
um

03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment sounds sounds kind of
 
03:45:45.650 --> 03:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
oxymoron there but
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I added
 
03:45:49.250 --> 03:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
to include administrative or clerical
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
errors and poverty as determined by
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines on December 31st in
 
03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
the calendar year preceding April 1st I
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
got a call from the New Hampshire Timber
 
03:46:00.650 --> 03:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
Owners Association uh Mr stock stock I
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
believe who's here to testify he had a
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
concern if this was going to exclude uh
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
an abatement on a Timber cut that was
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
assessed at say ten thousand came in
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
determined to be eight thousand would
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
that fall under the definition of
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
administrative if you look up the
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
definition of administrative it would
 
03:46:21.410 --> 03:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
fall under it but for clarity I added
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the bill I'm going to read the whole
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
thing administrative or clerical errors
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
assessment or valuation errors and
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
poverty as determined by federal
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines on December 31st and the
 
03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
calendar year preceding April 1st
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
this makes it clear makes it accountable
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's no ambiguity there's no back
 
03:46:39.889 --> 03:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
room deals you're not giving an
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
abatement to Uncle Henry because he
 
03:46:43.490 --> 03:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
can't pay his taxes we are
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
representatives of the taxpayer and this
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
provides efficiency and transparency for
 
03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:51.229 align:start position:0%
provides efficiency and transparency for
everyone

03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.929 --> 03:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do we have a
 
03:46:53.939 --> 03:46:54.969 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do we have a
question

03:46:54.969 --> 03:46:54.979 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
03:46:59.450 --> 03:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:47:05.690 --> 03:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
um under your latest Amendment the zero
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
one five five H uh who decides there is
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
a valuation error
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
so as you know Selectmen are responsible
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
for almost everything in a municipality
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of this is above our pay
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
grade we hire contract assessors in this
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
case we use Granite Hill Municipal
 
03:47:23.819 --> 03:47:24.550 align:start position:0%
case we use Granite Hill Municipal
Services

03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
he covers 12 municipalities through a
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
contract Service so he's about a large
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
company that is his determination to to
 
03:47:34.429 --> 03:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
bring all the rules and regulation that
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
the state sets for in assessments to
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
then advise the board how to vote so
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's up to him to make that
 
03:47:40.739 --> 03:47:43.790 align:start position:0%
it's up to him to make that
determination

03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.690 --> 03:47:46.700 align:start position:0%
further questions representative priests
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:47:51.650 --> 03:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question how many other
 
03:47:55.969 --> 03:47:55.979 align:start position:0%
communities have abused this privilege
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
under the state statutes besides
 
03:48:01.370 --> 03:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and Berlin so like I said these
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
are the only two that I could discover
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
but in my testimony these discussions
 
03:48:08.929 --> 03:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
occur in non-public so the public is not
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
privy to these discussions meaning they
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
do not see when these abatements go down
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's the underlying problem here so if
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
there's clearly defined if you remove
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
good cause when there are if they just
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
choose to do it in a non-public I don't
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
do them in non-public anymore I got away
 
03:48:24.050 --> 03:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
from it so this is not just the people
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
need to see our business so but if a
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
board has a right under that under the
 
03:48:30.290 --> 03:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
RSA that I decided to choose to do these
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
abatement discussions or Tax Matters for
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
reputational risk in a non-public it's
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
going to be defined as to how they can
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
grant that abatement and the public is
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
then protected
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:48:46.250 --> 03:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry representative
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't see you raising your hand
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sure thank you Mr chair
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes I am so the guy
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you contract with who tells you
 
03:49:10.370 --> 03:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
what the tax should be
 
03:49:10.380 --> 03:49:11.750 align:start position:0%
what the tax should be
correct

03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:49:13.610 --> 03:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
he is capable of making mistakes
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
clerical errors absolutely a human being
 
03:49:20.809 --> 03:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
and so would independent contractors
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
hired by the select board be subject to
 
03:49:29.450 --> 03:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
this new this amended law and if so
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
should they not be so outlined so
 
03:49:35.809 --> 03:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
abatement to ultimately approved by the
 
03:49:38.330 --> 03:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
board they're presented by the assessor
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the governing body which is the board
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen so when he makes his
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation the board has to either
 
03:49:47.690 --> 03:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
vote Yes or no so he cannot Grant it
 
03:49:50.210 --> 03:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
without the approval of the board takes
 
03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
a vote of the board
 
03:49:56.210 --> 03:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
follow up I don't believe that was my
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
question my question is
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
can an independent contractor be capable
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
of making a clerical error as is defined
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
in this law and if so should it not be
 
03:50:10.849 --> 03:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
stated in this law that this also
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:50:19.010 --> 03:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
I think it does by default because
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're governed by the rules set up for
 
03:50:23.570 --> 03:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
assessing practices by the ASB the
 
03:50:25.090 --> 03:50:25.100 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board
 
03:50:28.429 --> 03:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
again they can't if they make an error
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you an example they
 
03:50:32.450 --> 03:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
evaluate we get them all the time he
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
evaluates a house at 390 000. he put he
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
added at two extra bedrooms which turns
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
out on an internal site visit it wasn't
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
there the value now is 370 he recommends
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
the board to Grant the abatement because
 
03:50:47.690 --> 03:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
there's an error in the process yes
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's an error and it's able to be
 
03:50:51.469 --> 03:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
granted by the board of Selectmen who
 
03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
again ultimately has the say on it
 
03:50:57.229 --> 03:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie thank you Mr
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
03:51:02.450 --> 03:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
and I have to apologize I came they came
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
in late okay the chairman didn't give us
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
would this uh stop the selectman from uh
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
negotiating when somebody uh is selling
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
their home or
 
03:51:20.290 --> 03:51:20.300 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
way back in taxes to obey taxes
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
would they no longer be able to
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
negotiate with somebody who is destitute
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
and this is what happens
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the cases I'm a selecting
 
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
about it sure it's a destined to kind of
 
03:51:39.290 --> 03:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
a operation sure how would we handle
 
03:51:42.050 --> 03:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
somebody like that right historically
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've done it right so
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
when you say someone's back in taxes No
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
One by under the law this is another
 
03:51:51.410 --> 03:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
issue that came around in oshopee where
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
the board was granting illegal tax
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
payment plans Beyond a three-year period
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to do that if you are
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
a selectman and doing that I advise that
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
you stop because it's not legal once
 
03:52:02.809 --> 03:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
there's three years of unpaid taxes
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
you're required by law to then deed that
 
03:52:06.410 --> 03:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
property that's in the low odds black
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
and white no ambiguity there in the case
 
03:52:10.969 --> 03:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
of what you're saying that someone's
 
03:52:13.309 --> 03:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
destitute of hardship I did put poverty
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
in there and to follow the federal
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines and I do have that
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
printout and I did email to the whole
 
03:52:22.610 --> 03:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
committee showing exactly what they if I
 
03:52:25.309 --> 03:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
can find it in my pile here
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
showing exactly what the federal poverty
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines are which is what used by the
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I forget dhh
 
03:52:33.889 --> 03:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
on that DHHS somewhere in the state
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
utilizes this so that would give you
 
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
latitude to be able to Grant an
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
abatement for the poverty situation and
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
it goes from 100 to 300 above and that
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be up to the discretion of the
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen so so it gives you a
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
lot of latitude as to give that
 
03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
abatement just trying to find out how
 
03:52:52.130 --> 03:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
much you're taking away from us that's
 
03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
all thank you thank you I am I've been
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing this for quite a while and I in my
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
opinion it takes nothing away but it
 
03:52:59.929 --> 03:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
brings accountability thank you very
 
03:53:01.490 --> 03:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
much no problem thank you representative
 
03:53:01.500 --> 03:53:03.290 align:start position:0%
much no problem thank you representative
majority

03:53:03.290 --> 03:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
majority
 
03:53:04.849 --> 03:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:53:06.650 --> 03:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm curious
 
03:53:08.570 --> 03:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
you've offered several amendments you've
 
03:53:10.250 --> 03:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
clearly done your homework on this and I
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm concerned about as
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman stated the word
 
03:53:17.090 --> 03:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
error and I'm wondering if you had
 
03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
um let me just read it real quick to
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.090 --> 03:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
I I think by adding originally it was
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
assessment excuse me administrative or
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
clerical errors and then I added
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
assessment or valuation errors and
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
errors abroad is Broad it could be a
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
human error it could be
 
03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
um it usually it is human error when
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
they do an assessment it's it's up to
 
03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
the assessor to make a determination he
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
does his data entry and he goes back and
 
03:53:47.929 --> 03:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
determines the valuation makes his
 
03:53:49.729 --> 03:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
computer entry so that would cover a
 
03:53:51.650 --> 03:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
data entry in a computer or a field
 
03:53:55.250 --> 03:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
assessment error so I think it's covered
 
03:53:58.010 --> 03:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
seeing no more hands raised thank you
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
very much representative Smith thank you
 
03:54:20.210 --> 03:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon uh and thank you for
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify I'm Jason
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
stock I'm the executive director of the
 
03:54:29.809 --> 03:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
03:54:29.819 --> 03:54:31.130 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland Owners
Association

03:54:31.130 --> 03:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
and we I'm signed in and opposed in
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
um as you heard from the sponsor I I did
 
03:54:41.330 --> 03:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
give him a call and with respect to
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes and how Timber taxes are
 
03:54:45.530 --> 03:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
assessed because there is there are some
 
03:54:46.969 --> 03:54:46.979 align:start position:0%
judgment calls
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
when you have Timber attacks and when we
 
03:54:50.809 --> 03:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
read the bill
 
03:54:53.450 --> 03:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and said all right what is an
 
03:54:56.090 --> 03:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
administrative or clerical error to us
 
03:54:59.090 --> 03:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
that sounded more of a kind of a a I'll
 
03:55:01.130 --> 03:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
call it a mechanical error in in the
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
calculation a typographical error and we
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
said you know how would this affect my
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
ability as a Timberland owner if I have
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
a Timber Harvest on in town I um in the
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
particular piece of property was very
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to assess or the quality
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't of the Timber wasn't that great
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
the town who gets a assessment range
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue just
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
pegged me at the high end of the range
 
03:55:32.450 --> 03:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
because that's not a clerical error
 
03:55:34.130 --> 03:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
would that have would that in fact
 
03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
impact my ability to seek an abatement
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
and have that conversation with the
 
03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
select board to say hey wait a minute I
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
had to build two miles of road to to get
 
03:55:46.370 --> 03:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
to the back 40. this uh this Timber was
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:55:51.050 --> 03:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
storm damaged etc etc let's talk about
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
this this assessment
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
and and I am appreciative the the again
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
this was a conversation that happened
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
literally about an hour and a half to
 
03:56:04.510 --> 03:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
two hours ago I raised those concerns
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
and and the sponsor brought forth uh
 
03:56:13.490 --> 03:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment 155 H you've discussed this
 
03:56:13.500 --> 03:56:14.929 align:start position:0%
Amendment 155 H you've discussed this
already

03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
um regarding the any errors in
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
assessment or or valuation and so I
 
03:56:22.370 --> 03:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
think you know having looked at this
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
sitting here in the audience and having
 
03:56:25.610 --> 03:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
looked at this and reviewed it I think
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
that would take care of our kind of our
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
concern that if I am valued
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriately based on what's actually
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
on the ground I think that would cover
 
03:56:34.319 --> 03:56:35.689 align:start position:0%
on the ground I think that would cover
it

03:56:35.689 --> 03:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know in as much as our
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
concern is addressed in this this
 
03:56:42.889 --> 03:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
amendment it sounds like there are other
 
03:56:44.570 --> 03:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
broader questions and I'm not going to
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
speak to those but I just that's why I
 
03:56:48.889 --> 03:56:48.899 align:start position:0%
felt compelled to sign in and I
 
03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm just going to
 
03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
ask you the question
 
03:56:53.819 --> 03:56:55.010 align:start position:0%
ask you the question
um

03:56:55.010 --> 03:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing is because of the
 
03:57:00.250 --> 03:57:00.260 align:start position:0%
change in 155h the assessment evaluation
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
errors uh rectifies your concerns and
 
03:57:05.929 --> 03:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
then you would you would therefore be in
 
03:57:08.330 --> 03:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
support of the bill we would correct
 
03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
this this addresses Our concern we would
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
not we we would we could we're fine with
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
the bill with that Amendment like I said
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the other broader
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that thank you folks are
 
03:57:24.050 --> 03:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
vetting for the questions representative
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:57:31.250 --> 03:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
my question you are one group that this
 
03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
assessment or the evaluation could
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
affect and you were able to identify
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
could you
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
answer how many more such smaller groups
 
03:57:45.170 --> 03:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
would be or in a guesstimate I'm not
 
03:57:47.570 --> 03:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
asking you to give you exact but do you
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
think there are more that are not here
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
could be affected in a negative way
 
03:57:55.250 --> 03:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I think I
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
think there may be some others I I the
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
only the only other one that comes
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
immediately to the top of my mind is I
 
03:58:02.929 --> 03:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
know there's a gravel tax
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
um there's also a a means of assessing
 
03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
gravel I don't know if they would
 
03:58:08.450 --> 03:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
encounter I'm not real familiar with
 
03:58:08.460 --> 03:58:09.290 align:start position:0%
encounter I'm not real familiar with
that

03:58:09.290 --> 03:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
but that's the only other one that comes
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
to my mind
 
03:58:12.899 --> 03:58:13.490 align:start position:0%
to my mind
um

03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
as in terms of a quote property tax that
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
further questions I see none thank you
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony next we'll
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.720 --> 03:58:45.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:45.769 --> 03:58:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:47.570 --> 03:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity of
 
03:58:49.729 --> 03:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
speaking on this on this bill
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Sampson I recently
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
retired a couple months ago as Town
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the town of Canaan I'm
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm personal uh
 
03:58:59.819 --> 03:59:01.550 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm personal uh
position

03:59:01.550 --> 03:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:59:04.130 --> 03:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
but it's based on 12 years of experience
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
in the town of canyons the Town
 
03:59:05.640 --> 03:59:06.889 align:start position:0%
in the town of canyons the Town
Administrator

03:59:06.889 --> 03:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
Administrator
 
03:59:10.250 --> 03:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking in opposition to the bill
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to give you some reasons
 
03:59:11.760 --> 03:59:13.429 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to give you some reasons
why

03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
I understand that the language is vague
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
and subject to abuse in terms of for
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
good cause shown I've understand that
 
03:59:24.110 --> 03:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
I also understand that it's potentially
 
03:59:26.210 --> 03:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
possible for a town
 
03:59:30.170 --> 03:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
to do something behind closed doors
 
03:59:32.330 --> 03:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
I understand that too
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
I also understand they really shouldn't
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
be doing anything behind closed doors
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
period there has to be a public record
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
there has to be a public statement of
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
what happens it has to be available to
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
all the taxpayers and it should be a
 
03:59:45.769 --> 03:59:45.779 align:start position:0%
sufficient Clarity so you understand
 
03:59:48.889 --> 03:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
exactly who what where and how
 
03:59:51.050 --> 03:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
that's the way the law is supposed to be
 
03:59:51.060 --> 03:59:52.610 align:start position:0%
that's the way the law is supposed to be
working

03:59:52.610 --> 03:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:59:54.410 --> 03:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
so let me give you examples of things
 
03:59:56.809 --> 03:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
that could happen if this law is changed
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.050 --> 04:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
first of all this law addresses prior
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
year taxes it isn't just years not just
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
one year
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
so is that common in the law no it's not
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's actually this is the only law that
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of where if there is an error
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
that occurred or if there was a problem
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
that occurred or if the taxes went back
 
04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
two years or three years it's the only
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
way we could deal with it you can't file
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
for an abatement under normal
 
04:00:30.769 --> 04:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
circumstances till the close of a tax
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
year and then is taken up in the
 
04:00:34.849 --> 04:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
following year
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
so if you eliminate
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
those those possibilities from the as a
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
result of this change in the law for
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
prior year taxes your it causes problems
 
04:00:47.330 --> 04:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to deal with real
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
world issues so let me give you an
 
04:00:48.899 --> 04:00:51.290 align:start position:0%
world issues so let me give you an
example

04:00:51.290 --> 04:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
five times in the last 12 years we had
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
people who were elderly
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
and they didn't know anything about the
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions for elderly
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
nobody reached out to him until we
 
04:01:07.969 --> 04:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
reached out to him and said hey you're
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
three years behind in your taxes
 
04:01:14.330 --> 04:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
and with a great deal of weeping and a
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
great deal of concern these people that
 
04:01:19.130 --> 04:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
were living in a mobile home and a
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
quarter acre lot or an old farmhouse the
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
quarter liquor a quarter acre lot and
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
the mobile homes assisted 150 000 in the
 
04:01:30.290 --> 04:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
town of Canaan our our reduction in
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
value for an 80 year old person is a
 
04:01:34.250 --> 04:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
why because it's a lot cheaper to keep
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
somebody in their own home and give them
 
04:01:43.729 --> 04:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
a reduction on the appraised value of
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
so picture it now this person comes in
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
after three years of not paying the
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
taxes on a hundred and thirty five
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar property with a mobile
 
04:01:54.239 --> 04:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar property with a mobile
home

04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:01:57.889 --> 04:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
he says I've got to sell the property at
 
04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
that point that person owes five
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and they're living at
 
04:02:02.330 --> 04:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
about fifteen thousand dollars a year
 
04:02:07.010 --> 04:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
so what did we do
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
we said okay here's what we'll do we're
 
04:02:13.490 --> 04:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
going to put you on
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
as an exemption eighty thousand dollar
 
04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
exemption going forward and we
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you have no way to pay
 
04:02:22.910 --> 04:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
those taxes from the past unless you
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
sell your home
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
a typical rental for that person today
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the town of Canada
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
is somewhere between 800 and 1100 a
 
04:02:32.399 --> 04:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
is somewhere between 800 and 1100 a
month

04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
as a cost-effective matter for the town
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Canaan
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
not to mention the humanitarian issue
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
that was involved
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
it made absolute sense to Abate the
 
04:02:49.250 --> 04:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
taxes for those prior year taxes
 
04:02:52.490 --> 04:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
and to get them onto that program for
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
exemption in the future
 
04:02:57.170 --> 04:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
other things come up that are similar
 
04:02:59.450 --> 04:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
types of things we have several small
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
quote non-profits in the community
 
04:03:04.250 --> 04:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes
 
04:03:04.260 --> 04:03:06.349 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes
4-H

04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
4-H
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
if they have a problem with their taxes
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
and a particular year remember this is a
 
04:03:18.290 --> 04:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
volunteer organization it helps kids
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
with their future lives and it's all
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
done by people that really care about
 
04:03:24.650 --> 04:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
kids in the community
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
and if they can't pay their taxes unless
 
04:03:29.570 --> 04:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
somebody donates some money then they're
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
subject to the same three-year rule
 
04:03:36.889 --> 04:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
and it has come up in the past where
 
04:03:38.809 --> 04:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
that did happen
 
04:03:41.809 --> 04:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
and we abated the taxes for a particular
 
04:03:44.689 --> 04:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:47.450 --> 04:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
for one year
 
04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
this language as it was drafted has been
 
04:03:52.729 --> 04:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
used by our town probably seven or eight
 
04:03:54.889 --> 04:03:54.899 align:start position:0%
times always in public always on a
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
public record always with public
 
04:03:56.760 --> 04:03:58.130 align:start position:0%
public record always with public
discussion

04:03:58.130 --> 04:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
and we've on the divisive Council
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
believe that that was for good cause the
 
04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
good cause being the betterment of the
 
04:04:06.060 --> 04:04:07.490 align:start position:0%
good cause being the betterment of the
community

04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:04:10.370 --> 04:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
the humanitarian need to take care of
 
04:04:12.410 --> 04:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
people make sure they have housing
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
without jeopardizing anybody else
 
04:04:18.650 --> 04:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
except if there's a burden that goes
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
back to taxpayers as a result of it but
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
the truth of the matter is the town of
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
Canaan for the last 12 years that I was
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
in it whenever this happened we had to
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
cover those tax revenues so we're lost
 
04:04:32.689 --> 04:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
for the school for the county for the
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
state we still had to cover them it made
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely no difference to anybody else
 
04:04:37.969 --> 04:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
didn't make any difference to the school
 
04:04:40.370 --> 04:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
or the other taxpayers what it did do is
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
it came out of revenues were available
 
04:04:45.290 --> 04:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
in an assigned fund balance or reviews
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
they were left over at the end of the
 
04:04:49.490 --> 04:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
year in Surplus
 
04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
so number one
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
you get rid of this there is no
 
04:04:52.680 --> 04:04:53.809 align:start position:0%
you get rid of this there is no
flexibility

04:04:53.809 --> 04:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
04:04:55.250 --> 04:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
the only thing it could be for those
 
04:04:57.530 --> 04:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
specific things the examples I gave you
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
don't qualify under this language or the
 
04:05:00.180 --> 04:05:02.210 align:start position:0%
don't qualify under this language or the
amendment

04:05:02.210 --> 04:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
so you get rid of the flexibility number
 
04:05:04.439 --> 04:05:05.389 align:start position:0%
so you get rid of the flexibility number
two

04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
it means that we have to then
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
reduce our ability to be a Vibrant
 
04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
Community either with non-profits or for
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
people staying in their own homes and
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
being masters of their own fate
 
04:05:20.929 --> 04:05:20.939 align:start position:0%
so take us up somebody that's making
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
twelve to fifteen thousand dollars a
 
04:05:25.490 --> 04:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
year on Social Security
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
um sir I'm sorry we have about a three
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
minute time period no I apologize we're
 
04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
up to about six so if you could kind of
 
04:05:35.450 --> 04:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
wrap it up please I I hope I've made the
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
point I think that the language uh good
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
cause could be improved to say good
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
costs to the community or for
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
humanitarian purposes or something like
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
that but I think it'd be a mistake to
 
04:05:47.809 --> 04:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
get rid of all the flexibility that's
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
currently available in the law thank you
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
any questions representative priests uh
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question as I read the
 
04:05:58.260 --> 04:05:59.630 align:start position:0%
taking my question as I read the
amendment

04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
it says may and may is different from
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
Shell and may gives you the flexibility
 
04:06:10.150 --> 04:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
to take into these accounts the
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
humanitarian cases that one might see is
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm sorry I don't have a copy of
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of me but the
 
04:06:21.650 --> 04:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
question is does the May
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
right now it's it's may as well
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
but it may means the selectment you know
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
my selectment informed me yesterday look
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
or my chairman of the board reinformed
 
04:06:33.410 --> 04:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
me yesterday look there's nobody else
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
closer to the community than the board
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen in any given town okay I'm
 
04:06:39.410 --> 04:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
gonna I'll answer representative
 
04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
priest's question the word may Abate is
 
04:06:44.450 --> 04:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
there you are correct that is existing
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
language that is not changing so uh for
 
04:06:50.809 --> 04:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee I think
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to to tell everybody
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
anything that's in bold is new anything
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is in uh unbold or whatever you
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
would call it a regular font is is
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
existing language okay so we have
 
04:07:10.670 --> 04:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
um the only thing in here and speaking
 
04:07:13.090 --> 04:07:13.100 align:start position:0%
to some of the points uh
 
04:07:16.849 --> 04:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Sampson has made
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
the only thing in this bill that has
 
04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
changed is the removal of good cause
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
shown and then clarifications making it
 
04:07:29.210 --> 04:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
more specific as to what that might have
 
04:07:32.330 --> 04:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
met met that's the only change so that's
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
just for clarification any further
 
04:07:34.439 --> 04:07:37.309 align:start position:0%
just for clarification any further
questions

04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.530 --> 04:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative save us thank you Mr
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:07:41.279 --> 04:07:42.530 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

04:07:42.530 --> 04:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
um say you don't have the amendment in
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
correct if the amendment included the
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
word poverty as a condition would that
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
change your view of the bill it wouldn't
 
04:07:59.150 --> 04:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't uh
 
04:08:02.929 --> 04:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
the representative is correct the three
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
levels of non-profit non-poverty it's
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
100 off 200 300 so it doesn't Define
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
which one either and you could have
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
fairly heavy pay uh three three times
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
poverty level
 
04:08:18.530 --> 04:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I guess my
 
04:08:23.210 --> 04:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
question for you is if it was required
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
in these instances just to be
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory to be done in public hearing
 
04:08:30.769 --> 04:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy your concerns oh yes
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think it already requires a
 
04:08:37.130 --> 04:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.889 --> 04:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you for your testimony
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.450 --> 04:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
nature Grace sorry
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature craze for the
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association so
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this bill
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
um because I know many of you have have
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
looked at our policies since I handed
 
04:09:06.050 --> 04:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
them out
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:09:10.370 --> 04:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
have a policy to support what our what
 
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
our members bring forward and so I know
 
04:09:15.050 --> 04:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
that the town of Ossipee supported this
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
um and we also have an obligation to
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
protect local authorities so we weren't
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
quite sure what to do so we brought that
 
04:09:21.530 --> 04:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
to our board of directors last Friday
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
and they instructed us to oppose this
 
04:09:24.239 --> 04:09:25.490 align:start position:0%
and they instructed us to oppose this
bill

04:09:25.490 --> 04:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
um because it limits Authority and and
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the select board
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe I really need to add
 
04:09:32.040 --> 04:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe I really need to add
anything

04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
um given the last uh speakers
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
um explanation
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I I do want to add in
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
response to a question that
 
04:09:43.610 --> 04:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative Brown asked
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
um requiring that these abatements occur
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
in public the only statute Tory
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
framework that I'm aware that you might
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to look at is the welfare statute
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
because there is something in there
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
about protecting the privacy of people
 
04:10:00.050 --> 04:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
receiving Municipal welfare so you just
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure there's no statutory
 
04:10:03.769 --> 04:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
conflict if you go that route
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
have to take any questions thank you
 
04:10:08.330 --> 04:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
very much Nate uh representative
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
my question uh Mr Grace
 
04:10:16.210 --> 04:10:16.220 align:start position:0%
in in a
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
representing your towns and
 
04:10:18.300 --> 04:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
representing your towns and
municipalities

04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
does this in uh in light of local
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
control versus State Control where does
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
this fall
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
taking away local control or giving
 
04:10:29.640 --> 04:10:31.429 align:start position:0%
taking away local control or giving
local

04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
well obviously there's there's currently
 
04:10:35.689 --> 04:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
broad local Authority just with the
 
04:10:38.330 --> 04:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
phrase good cause which is not defined
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and that obviously has caused some
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
issues in some municipalities
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
if that were to be restricted that that
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
would be uh that would be a state
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:10:57.530 --> 04:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
you whoops and on that we will close the
 
04:11:04.130 --> 04:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
hearing right after I say the blue sheet
 
04:11:11.229 --> 04:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
now it's close you can uh send an uh
 
04:11:17.450 --> 04:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
go online and send us something if you'd
 
04:11:17.460 --> 04:11:22.670 align:start position:0%
go online and send us something if you'd
like

04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay next up we have House Bill 177
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of qualified
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%

04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief incentive
 
04:11:36.650 --> 04:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're slightly behind representative
 
04:11:36.660 --> 04:11:39.469 align:start position:0%
we're slightly behind representative
Hill

04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:11:48.889 --> 04:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Pat long
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro District 23 in
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 177 was brought a ball
 
04:11:57.889 --> 04:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
through the discussion with land use
 
04:11:59.809 --> 04:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
developers attorneys including small
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
residential owners looking to fill gaps
 
04:12:03.769 --> 04:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
in the housing market
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
790 is is tax relief incentive dedicated
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
to existing structures following a
 
04:12:11.210 --> 04:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
process enabling municipalities and
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
developing policy as to how it would
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
work for them
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
RSA 79e also requires a review of
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
potential historical and our cultural
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
value of the existing structure as it
 
04:12:23.809 --> 04:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
relates to the municipality
 
04:12:26.450 --> 04:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
my limited knowledge of 79e is through
 
04:12:28.490 --> 04:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
serving on the planning board the
 
04:12:30.410 --> 04:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
Heritage commission and the board of
 
04:12:33.769 --> 04:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
aldermen Hospital 177 in his attempt in
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
broadening the scope and its incentives
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
to all areas of the municipality to
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
include available land with no
 
04:12:42.530 --> 04:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
structures on it while maintaining its
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
historical and cultural discussions
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
an example
 
04:12:48.769 --> 04:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
as an example a piece of property in a
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhood has a potential for
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
economic revitalization if RSA 79e can
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
be considered where currently there's no
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
consideration although municipalities
 
04:13:00.290 --> 04:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
could target areas of use I find it
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
difficult in predicting where those
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
areas will be until a proposal is
 
04:13:05.929 --> 04:13:05.939 align:start position:0%
brought to either the zoning and the
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
planning board in closing House Bill 177
 
04:13:11.330 --> 04:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
offers an expansions of of incentives
 
04:13:12.889 --> 04:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
that would benefit both the residents
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the municipality
 
04:13:16.849 --> 04:13:16.859 align:start position:0%
um in in the city of Manchester we had
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
an example of a new four-story apartment
 
04:13:20.510 --> 04:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
unit going up
 
04:13:23.150 --> 04:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
in a neighborhood with no stores no
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
businesses no nothing one stat four
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
tournament apartment went out there was
 
04:13:30.410 --> 04:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
a barber shop a cultural Barber Shop
 
04:13:30.420 --> 04:13:31.070 align:start position:0%
a barber shop a cultural Barber Shop
um

04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
a small a small Corner Store a small
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
hardware store so that's one of the
 
04:13:39.769 --> 04:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
reasons why expanding this would be
 
04:13:39.779 --> 04:13:42.050 align:start position:0%
reasons why expanding this would be
beneficial

04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.490 --> 04:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%

representative long for taking my
question

04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:13:53.760 --> 04:13:56.090 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:13:56.090 --> 04:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
property the definition of property and
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to a tax relief incentive
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
would you be open to adding the word
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
deeded property so that it's clear in
 
04:14:12.650 --> 04:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
the statute should this pass
 
04:14:14.929 --> 04:14:14.939 align:start position:0%
to whom the tax relief incentive would
 
04:14:14.939 --> 04:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
to whom the tax relief incentive would
go

04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I don't have an issue with that
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
I mean as an attorney person that's
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to be uh coming up after me he's
 
04:14:21.960 --> 04:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
going to be uh coming up after me he's
more

04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative benchputi thank you Mr
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
Jude thanks uh thank you representative
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
long for taking my question
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
how would this benefit with all the tax
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
exemption and community vitalization tax
 
04:14:49.010 --> 04:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
how would this address the need of
 
04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
community in terms of providing housing
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
or roof over the head for the citizens
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
of Manchester well thank you for the
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
question representative I I
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
currently we have uh the city of
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester has 1900 units in the queue
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh residential units uh the residential
 
04:15:10.010 --> 04:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
units in this 790 which by the way is
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
enabling it's not a it's not a necessity
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's enabling through the municipalities
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the downtown area there's
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
roughly about four uh 12 to 1300 units
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
going in there and uh this is where the
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
780 is available and sitting on a
 
04:15:28.969 --> 04:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
planning board there are ass are there
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
any affordable housing units coming in
 
04:15:32.689 --> 04:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
there and the answer is no in the
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
downtown area you're less apt to get
 
04:15:36.729 --> 04:15:36.739 align:start position:0%
affordable housing you want market rate
 
04:15:39.530 --> 04:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
so the answer is no so this would allow
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
outside of the downtown area
 
04:15:44.650 --> 04:15:44.660 align:start position:0%
um to expand uh
 
04:15:48.769 --> 04:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
further questions representative pop
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question is is the the term
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
property defined anywhere in statute is
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
there a reference that that
 
04:16:05.090 --> 04:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
where you're citing and going back to
 
04:16:07.610 --> 04:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
yeah actually
 
04:16:09.170 --> 04:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
I mean I can't give you the legal
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
definition you know my definition is
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's right now it's only addresses uh
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
structures that are already up uh this
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
would expand it to land that's available
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
if there's an abandoned you know if
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's a plot of land somewhere as that
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
could be used instead of uh just
 
04:16:31.250 --> 04:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
property that has structures on them and
 
04:16:33.889 --> 04:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
again uh attorney brison may be more
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing a similar theme that the
 
04:16:49.550 --> 04:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
word property is um
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
problematic I guess because I had the
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
same kind of question and would you be
 
04:16:58.370 --> 04:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
open to changing it uh sort of along uh
 
04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis lines to
 
04:17:01.020 --> 04:17:02.950 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis lines to
um

04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I forgot what you said yeah I
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
know I forgotten the words I wanted to
 
04:17:08.880 --> 04:17:09.950 align:start position:0%
know I forgotten the words I wanted to
use

04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:17:09.960 --> 04:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
use
um

04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
I'll have to come back to it a lot of
 
04:17:13.739 --> 04:17:14.530 align:start position:0%
I'll have to come back to it a lot of
record

04:17:14.530 --> 04:17:14.540 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
any any language change that the
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee after doing your due diligence
 
04:17:21.050 --> 04:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
you'd want to change it would suffice to
 
04:17:22.849 --> 04:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
me and can I have a follow-up Mr chair
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh follow up go ahead and the uh the
 
04:17:27.050 --> 04:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
last thing was
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
um with this kind of change going from
 
04:17:34.130 --> 04:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
structures to a generic parcel would we
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
have to re-adopt the RSA that the
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
enabling action that first took place
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe that uh I got a call from
 
04:17:43.610 --> 04:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Municipal Association uh
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
that that would be uh suggested that
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
municipalities re-adopt the 790 policy
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
as as it fits them with this new change
 
04:17:53.090 --> 04:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:17:55.370 --> 04:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
04:18:00.530 --> 04:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you for allowing me
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
to question and thank you for taking my
 
04:18:02.640 --> 04:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
to question and thank you for taking my
question

04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
um you're very familiar with the city of
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester and you probably have an idea
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
how many new parcels
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
occur in the city of Manchester
 
04:18:19.849 --> 04:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
and how many housing proximately housing
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
units could be built with this tax
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
incentive yeah thank you for the
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
question I mean I couldn't guess then
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
how many I have been approached by the
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
small landlords uh who says if I do you
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
know what can you give me if I do this
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
and it's you know it's a four-story
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
tenement with a barber shop or a
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
hardware store or and there is no
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
incentive I could give them other than
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
maybe an expedited planning board
 
04:18:52.010 --> 04:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
process or what have you and that's it
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
mangaputi I see you down there
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Ted I was wondering but
 
04:19:07.330 --> 04:19:07.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging thank you
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative long for uh taking my
 
04:19:14.150 --> 04:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
you have uh that community
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief incentives
 
04:19:23.570 --> 04:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
have you looked at other incentives like
 
04:19:26.150 --> 04:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
property assess clean energy
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh investment credit or infrastructure
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
basically those kind of tax credit and
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
incentives that is not available
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
currently but available federally would
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
that enhance
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
to build a community that's needed today
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
not 10 years down below sure yeah I have
 
04:19:47.689 --> 04:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I have
 
04:19:50.150 --> 04:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
looked at that and it's it is minimal
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't really push the project
 
04:19:52.140 --> 04:19:53.269 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't really push the project
over

04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know over the line to go uh but yes
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'd have considered those still
 
04:20:01.969 --> 04:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
next we have John Bisson Beeson
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm from whenever I'm from
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
in Lewiston Maine it's Bisal so I
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
04:20:23.809 --> 04:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm John Bisson which is what I say
 
04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I'm an attorney
 
04:20:29.290 --> 04:20:29.300 align:start position:0%
from Manchester as Mr
 
04:20:34.490 --> 04:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative long said our firm is
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
actively involved representing
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
developers landowners and I think some
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
of the questions that you had you're all
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on some really interesting
 
04:20:45.290 --> 04:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
issues with the statute and the changes
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
what is being asked is to expand the
 
04:20:51.910 --> 04:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
community revitalization tax relief
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
incentive program and I'm here to report
 
04:20:58.330 --> 04:20:58.340 align:start position:0%
that it is a wildly successful program
 
04:21:01.330 --> 04:21:01.340 align:start position:0%
as it exists now
 
04:21:04.130 --> 04:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
what the amendment is suggesting and
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
proposing is to expand the scope of what
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
already exists in two ways right now the
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
statute is geographically Limited
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
to but by reference to town center and
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
downtown the existing language says this
 
04:21:22.969 --> 04:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
program is available at the town center
 
04:21:27.050 --> 04:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
and downtown in addition it applies as
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
it exists today only to structures it
 
04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
does not apply as representative long
 
04:21:36.050 --> 04:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
suggested to open Parcels of land so the
 
04:21:37.849 --> 04:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being proposed again
 
04:21:39.410 --> 04:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
will do two things
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
it will allow the municipality to use
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
this incentive program throughout its
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
Community not limited to the downtown or
 
04:21:51.410 --> 04:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
the center and if you're familiar with
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester you know if you're driving
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
along Brown Avenue towards Litchfield
 
04:21:58.969 --> 04:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
you're not in the downtown you're not in
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
the town center and if there's a
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
property that doesn't have a building on
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
it this program wouldn't be available
 
04:22:08.090 --> 04:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
and so the amendment would would broaden
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
its reach and and also the relief that
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
is or the incentive that's being
 
04:22:16.610 --> 04:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
proposed as it exists now it's really
 
04:22:21.410 --> 04:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
just a pause right it's a pause on the
 
04:22:24.010 --> 04:22:24.020 align:start position:0%
increase in the tax
 
04:22:27.769 --> 04:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
bill that a developer would face and I
 
04:22:30.410 --> 04:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
think that's important developers in the
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
example that Mr long talked about you
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
know if if you have a sort of a
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
distressed property and you're thinking
 
04:22:38.150 --> 04:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
I really should invest in it I should
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
make it more valuable you've got a
 
04:22:41.929 --> 04:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
double whammy right you're going to put
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
money in the property and then the
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
community is going to tax you at a
 
04:22:46.610 --> 04:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
higher rate
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
we all appreciate that that's how taxes
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
work this incentive program gives you a
 
04:22:54.290 --> 04:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
pause it doesn't forgive you from that
 
04:22:56.570 --> 04:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
increased tax forever it's for a limited
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
period of time as an incentive as the
 
04:23:02.570 --> 04:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
statute was defined I can give you some
 
04:23:04.969 --> 04:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
really clear specific examples of how
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
this program has been as I said wildly
 
04:23:07.620 --> 04:23:09.010 align:start position:0%
this program has been as I said wildly
successful

04:23:09.010 --> 04:23:09.020 align:start position:0%
successful
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
73 Hanover Street in Manchester if
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
you've been there it's right across the
 
04:23:16.490 --> 04:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
street from the Palace Theater it was an
 
04:23:18.889 --> 04:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
underused commercial property
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
on the cusp of becoming kind of an
 
04:23:23.929 --> 04:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
eyesore because it was vacant and you
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't put tenants in there because it
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
was commercial
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
so a developer looked at it and said I
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
can rehabilitate that property
 
04:23:34.189 --> 04:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I I'm trying to make the numbers
 
04:23:34.199 --> 04:23:35.269 align:start position:0%
and I I'm trying to make the numbers
work

04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:23:37.729 --> 04:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
if I dump a ton of money into it I'm
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to have this increased tax bill
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
what can you do for me so the developer
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
is looking at a building built in 1871
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
45 000 square feet of commercial space
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
that basically can't be rented
 
04:23:51.530 --> 04:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
the developer dumps eight million
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
dollars into the property
 
04:23:58.130 --> 04:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
adds 43 rental units and retail space on
 
04:24:01.490 --> 04:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
the on the ground floor in addition it's
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to Spruce the property up we're
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
gonna have a better entrance a better
 
04:24:06.410 --> 04:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
exterior it's right there in the center
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
of Manchester and it's going to bring 43
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
new apartments to downtown Manchester
 
04:24:15.050 --> 04:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
part of the the inventory that Mr long
 
04:24:18.170 --> 04:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
was talking about 379 Elm Street in
 
04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's right across from
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
Market Basket on South Elm it's a
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
beautiful new apartment building that's
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
going in there it's a 15 million dollar
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
building and it replaced a vacant
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
Warehouse the former Goulet Supply
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
building built in the early 1900s that
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
was crumbling and vacant
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
same thing I need help I need incentive
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
those two properties 133 residential
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
units in downtown Manchester my favorite
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
project probably even though I'm not
 
04:24:52.130 --> 04:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
from the area because I'm from
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester the China Mill in Allenstown
 
04:24:57.370 --> 04:24:57.380 align:start position:0%
if anybody knows it it was a beautiful
 
04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
Mill when it was built architectural gem
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
falling apart
 
04:25:08.290 --> 04:25:08.300 align:start position:0%
an absolute eyesore vacant falling apart
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
168 000 square feet built in 1870
 
04:25:16.010 --> 04:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
the developer same idea that we've got
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
this eyesore I need help 22 million
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
dollars into that building it's going to
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
bring 150 Apartments to Allenstown New
 
04:25:25.800 --> 04:25:27.050 align:start position:0%
bring 150 Apartments to Allenstown New
Hampshire

04:25:27.050 --> 04:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
not only is it going to bring a 150
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
Apartments it's going to bring all those
 
04:25:36.889 --> 04:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
residents within feet of the downtown of
 
04:25:39.170 --> 04:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
Allenstown I would love to own a copy
 
04:25:41.929 --> 04:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
Coffee coffee shop on the corner because
 
04:25:43.250 --> 04:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to have all these young
 
04:25:43.260 --> 04:25:44.269 align:start position:0%
you're going to have all these young
people

04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:25:47.689 --> 04:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
living there so that's what this
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
incentive program has done it's wildly
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
successful those are just three examples
 
04:25:55.130 --> 04:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
that my small firm in Manchester knows
 
04:25:57.530 --> 04:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
about if you looked harder and farther
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
you'd find far far more
 
04:26:03.410 --> 04:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
um The Limited changes that you're
 
04:26:06.110 --> 04:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
making will give the municipality the
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
authority to use this tool
 
04:26:11.210 --> 04:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
throughout its Community without
 
04:26:14.929 --> 04:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
Geographic limitation and to include
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
open space process as well as structures
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that you had that
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
I listened to before with respect to the
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
deed reference and the the definition
 
04:26:29.450 --> 04:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
situations there are other parts of the
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
statute that are not being amended here
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
today that deal with those issues
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's an application process that
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
needs to go to the community level the
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
applicant must be the landowner so the
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
the issue of D did I don't think it's
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
necessary I don't think it would change
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
anything but the part of the application
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
process we have to submit the deed and
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
all of that other stuff so it deals with
 
04:26:54.600 --> 04:26:55.809 align:start position:0%
all of that other stuff so it deals with
that

04:26:55.809 --> 04:26:55.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
I can't
 
04:27:01.490 --> 04:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I can't come up with a reason
 
04:27:04.490 --> 04:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
based on the success of the program to
 
04:27:06.410 --> 04:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
Advocate against this it's a very
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
successful program and it's been used
 
04:27:09.530 --> 04:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and I would
 
04:27:11.570 --> 04:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do this amendment
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
Fair testimony
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
04:27:16.020 --> 04:27:19.429 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
Gallagher

04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
hi so um I have a a question about the
 
04:27:25.439 --> 04:27:26.570 align:start position:0%
hi so um I have a a question about the
uh

04:27:26.570 --> 04:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
so you split it into two sections one
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
about location and on the other about
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
prep property um so
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
um my questions about the first part as
 
04:27:39.769 --> 04:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
um someone who considers myself
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
an urbanist and represents a downtown
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
district of here here in Concord um I'm
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
a big fan of
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
having towns having and cities having
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
strong downtowns for the all the
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
benefits that increased density brings
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of wondering about these
 
04:28:04.849 --> 04:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
other designated sections like could you
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
give us some examples of what these
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
other designated
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
sections might be and if this will take
 
04:28:16.250 --> 04:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
away from downtowns at all
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question thank you
 
04:28:22.729 --> 04:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
designated sections would give authority
 
04:28:25.450 --> 04:28:25.460 align:start position:0%
to your community conquered to create
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
sections zoning districts Etc where this
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
relief would be available to encourage
 
04:28:36.170 --> 04:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
in Manchester for example out by the
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
airport that's a Zone that's a district
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
that could be a designated section so if
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
you look at the language that's being
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
proposed in the amendment you're adding
 
04:28:48.250 --> 04:28:48.260 align:start position:0%
to the statement that says to enhance
 
04:28:51.649 --> 04:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
downtowns and town centers or other
 
04:28:53.809 --> 04:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
designated sections of a municipality
 
04:28:57.050 --> 04:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's the local Authority deciding
 
04:28:58.849 --> 04:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
where the tools should be available to
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.130 --> 04:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:29:05.939 --> 04:29:07.250 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

04:29:07.250 --> 04:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:29:07.260 --> 04:29:08.210 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
pose a hypothetical
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
that relates to the bill and to the
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
process and to get to get your expertise
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
in a um in a municipality West Downtown
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
West Lebanon New Hampshire you may know
 
04:29:24.120 --> 04:29:24.910 align:start position:0%
West Lebanon New Hampshire you may know
it

04:29:24.910 --> 04:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
there are several properties
 
04:29:32.090 --> 04:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
that are owned by folks in town that
 
04:29:32.100 --> 04:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
that are owned by folks in town that
have

04:29:32.950 --> 04:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:29:36.889 --> 04:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
setback rental buildings that are rented
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
to various tenants at various times but
 
04:29:43.010 --> 04:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
that have Frontage considerable Frontage
 
04:29:45.889 --> 04:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
that is completely dilapidated parking
 
04:29:48.010 --> 04:29:48.020 align:start position:0%
parking lot that no one can park in
 
04:29:51.769 --> 04:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
grass growing up in the cracks
 
04:29:55.849 --> 04:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
will this apply to that portion of that
 
04:29:55.859 --> 04:29:57.530 align:start position:0%
will this apply to that portion of that
property

04:29:57.530 --> 04:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:30:00.110 --> 04:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
that might entice that landowner that
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
property owner who owns the structure
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
and is renting it but does not care to
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
do anything about the vacant lot in
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
front of it could this be of benefit to
 
04:30:12.290 --> 04:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
us a city like West Lebanon where that
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
is very prevalent
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
it I suppose it could be the issue would
 
04:30:17.100 --> 04:30:17.929 align:start position:0%
it I suppose it could be the issue would
be

04:30:17.929 --> 04:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
the the motivation right for the owner
 
04:30:23.809 --> 04:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
if they could figure out a way to add
 
04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
additional rental units by redeveloping
 
04:30:29.530 --> 04:30:29.540 align:start position:0%
that blighted part of their property
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
then this incentive program would be
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
helpful because there's there's in
 
04:30:36.649 --> 04:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
addition to the location issues of the
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
statute as amended there's also a
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
qualifier that says the amount there's
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
numbers on the amount of the investment
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
it has to exceed a certain percentage of
 
04:30:44.760 --> 04:30:46.149 align:start position:0%
it has to exceed a certain percentage of
the

04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
pre-change value so in your situation
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
someone would have to look at this part
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
of their property and say I can add six
 
04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
units and it's going to cost me two
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars and the rest of it works
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
then they could get the the benefit of
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
the incentive so it is a tool that may
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
be available but it goes back to whether
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
or not the owner can develop the
 
04:31:10.370 --> 04:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
property in such a way that they can
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
create more units but simply to to
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
beautify it this would not work thank
 
04:31:16.439 --> 04:31:18.849 align:start position:0%
beautify it this would not work thank
you

04:31:18.849 --> 04:31:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative manager booty thank you
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking through the bill
 
04:31:26.880 --> 04:31:28.429 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking through the bill
and

04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:28.439 --> 04:31:29.210 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:31:29.210 --> 04:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:34.210 --> 04:31:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
influence or change RSA 53 the municipal
 
04:31:46.090 --> 04:31:46.100 align:start position:0%
PACE program I don't see any
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.090 --> 04:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry what was the second
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
reference uh the RSA 53 I'm not familiar
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head what that is that

thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we have no
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I just want to
 
04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
provide uh information to the committee
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so there are there are two things we
 
04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
noted when reading through the bill
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
um there did not appear to be language
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
about whether re-adoption would be
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
required or not of the 79e statute I
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
know that representative Gilman asked
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
that question and the kind of Corolla
 
04:33:00.769 --> 04:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
corollary question that we had was
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
whether this would be retroactive or not
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a definitional change
 
04:33:05.959 --> 04:33:07.689 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a definitional change
79e

04:33:07.689 --> 04:33:07.699 align:start position:0%
79e
 
04:33:10.570 --> 04:33:10.580 align:start position:0%
zones already exist throughout the state
 
04:33:13.551 --> 04:33:13.561 align:start position:0%
and we just wanted to have Clarity on
 
04:33:16.010 --> 04:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
whether that would that would change or
 
04:33:16.020 --> 04:33:17.449 align:start position:0%
whether that would that would change or
not

04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:33:19.730 --> 04:33:19.740 align:start position:0%

I have what I think for you is a very
 
04:34:53.631 --> 04:34:53.641 align:start position:0%
simple bill but I should introduce
 
04:34:56.209 --> 04:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
myself I am representative Greg Hill
 
04:34:59.650 --> 04:34:59.660 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Northfield
 
04:35:04.689 --> 04:35:04.699 align:start position:0%
I am here to introduce House Bill 293
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
which I think I would classify as a
 
04:35:09.289 --> 04:35:09.299 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill more than anything
 
04:35:09.299 --> 04:35:10.970 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill more than anything
else

04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:35:10.980 --> 04:35:11.869 align:start position:0%
else
um

04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
I should point out uh that I have
 
04:35:20.170 --> 04:35:20.180 align:start position:0%
um attempted to do this in my local town
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
and was thwarted in that effort by the
 
04:35:25.490 --> 04:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
town attorney
 
04:35:25.500 --> 04:35:26.929 align:start position:0%
town attorney
um

04:35:26.929 --> 04:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:30.170 --> 04:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
the uh the selectman requested
 
04:35:32.449 --> 04:35:32.459 align:start position:0%
information from the town attorney to
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
find out if um if such a thing a town
 
04:35:39.289 --> 04:35:39.299 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund would be an appropriate
 
04:35:41.810 --> 04:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
thing for us to do through a petition
 
04:35:44.929 --> 04:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
Warren article which is what I filed and
 
04:35:47.170 --> 04:35:47.180 align:start position:0%
uh and the town attorney
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
recommended no it would not be
 
04:35:49.859 --> 04:35:51.529 align:start position:0%
recommended no it would not be
appropriate

04:35:51.529 --> 04:35:51.539 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
and the reason is if you look at RSA 31
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
colon 19a which is what the bill is
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:36:05.631 --> 04:36:05.641 align:start position:0%
it says the town May at any annual or
 
04:36:08.330 --> 04:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
special meeting Grant and vote such sums
 
04:36:10.730 --> 04:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
of money as it deems necessary to create
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
trust funds for the maintenance and
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
operation of the town
 
04:36:19.209 --> 04:36:19.219 align:start position:0%
and that bold section was not there
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
and then it says and any other public
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
purpose that is not foreign to the
 
04:36:29.209 --> 04:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
town's institution or incompatible with
 
04:36:31.970 --> 04:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
the objects of its organization
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's what the attorney was pointing to
 
04:36:37.849 --> 04:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
that that last or
 
04:36:42.890 --> 04:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
um he said that because the town is a
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
part of a Cooperative School District
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a reason to have a town
 
04:36:50.760 --> 04:36:51.949 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a reason to have a town
scholarship

04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
04:36:55.609 --> 04:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
if the town had their own School
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
District then it would be okay
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
again attorneys the attorney's words not
 
04:37:02.400 --> 04:37:03.890 align:start position:0%
again attorneys the attorney's words not
mine

04:37:03.890 --> 04:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
mine
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
um and in fact in conversations with uh
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
an attorney over at the Attorney
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
General's office just last week he
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there are any number of
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
towns that already have these
 
04:37:17.929 --> 04:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs and I'm getting
 
04:37:21.650 --> 04:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
nods uh so they're aware
 
04:37:23.410 --> 04:37:23.420 align:start position:0%
um but because
 
04:37:26.449 --> 04:37:26.459 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative School District didn't
 
04:37:26.459 --> 04:37:28.070 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative School District didn't
have

04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:37:28.080 --> 04:37:29.029 align:start position:0%
have
um

04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
education or scholarship in its
 
04:37:33.000 --> 04:37:34.810 align:start position:0%
education or scholarship in its
purview

04:37:34.810 --> 04:37:34.820 align:start position:0%
purview
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
they said that or this attorney said it
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
was only appropriate if it was
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
specifically spelled out in the law
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is why I'm here
 
04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
um so from my standpoint
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
um just specifically spelling it out by
 
04:37:56.810 --> 04:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
saying for dedicated scholarship trust
 
04:37:59.051 --> 04:37:59.061 align:start position:0%
funds exclusively for Town residents
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
that that satisfies that and that was
 
04:38:05.209 --> 04:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
the language that I asked the attorney
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
um what what would be appropriate for me
 
04:38:11.689 --> 04:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
to put in that that section
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what other information
 
04:38:16.849 --> 04:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
oh I I should mention to you that the
 
04:38:19.369 --> 04:38:19.379 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office had called me
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
last week to ask about this but only
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
because he was he wanted to confirm with
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
me that this money would not be
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
co-mingled with any uh donated money
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
that comes to the town for under that's
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
under the purview of the trustee of the
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
trust funds
 
04:38:42.529 --> 04:38:42.539 align:start position:0%
um don't
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
here's another Oddity for your
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
edification donated money that comes to
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
a town is covered under the Attorney
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
General's purview but money that that is
 
04:38:58.010 --> 04:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the town is covered
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
under the dra so he he was just letting
 
04:39:04.510 --> 04:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
me know that there was no
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
conflict from his standpoint unless we
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
co-mingled those funds with donated
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
money that came to the town
 
04:39:16.609 --> 04:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to answer any
 
04:39:16.619 --> 04:39:19.131 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.051 --> 04:39:21.061 align:start position:0%

intent and and the reason that the town
 
04:39:56.690 --> 04:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
attorney got involved in it was that we
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
had a petition warrant article
 
04:40:03.170 --> 04:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
um on on the Town Warren asking to raise
 
04:40:04.490 --> 04:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
an appropriate
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
and and it was so long ago I don't
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
remember how much we were doing not that
 
04:40:10.010 --> 04:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
it matters
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
um but that was that was what we were
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
doing was Raising and appropriating at
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:40:24.288 --> 04:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
taking my question wouldn't such an
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it would be
 
04:40:40.010 --> 04:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I I think this was well I mean I
 
04:40:42.890 --> 04:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
could see how the argument could be made
 
04:40:48.410 --> 04:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
um but it was in terms of the
 
04:40:48.420 --> 04:40:48.948 align:start position:0%
um but it was in terms of the
um

04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to
 
04:40:54.288 --> 04:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
scramble here and think how it was
 
04:40:57.410 --> 04:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
worded at the time but in terms of the
 
04:41:00.890 --> 04:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
town meeting it was almost as if we were
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
raising and appropriating
 
04:41:03.420 --> 04:41:04.730 align:start position:0%
raising and appropriating
um

04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:08.690 --> 04:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh money for any event that we've done
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've raised and
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated money to send a group to a
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
convention somewhere or something like
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
that and I suppose ultimately it does
 
04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
come from taxation
 
04:41:22.620 --> 04:41:24.288 align:start position:0%
come from taxation
um

04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:27.530 --> 04:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
but I just it it wasn't it wasn't
 
04:41:29.570 --> 04:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
objected to a town meeting for that
 
04:41:29.580 --> 04:41:30.650 align:start position:0%
objected to a town meeting for that
purpose

04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
hi um I was just wondering
 
04:41:43.448 --> 04:41:43.458 align:start position:0%
if we could get some clarification about
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
what type of scholarships specifically
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
were talking about here like what level
 
04:41:51.610 --> 04:41:51.620 align:start position:0%
of school primary secondary
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
post-secondary or what
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question
 
04:41:57.718 --> 04:41:58.310 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question
um

04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
what we were talking about at the time
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
um but I purposely left it blank
 
04:42:07.070 --> 04:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
um from from my standpoint this is
 
04:42:09.410 --> 04:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that's why it says
 
04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
may a town May
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to leave it up to the town
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
to decide what those scholarships would
 
04:42:21.128 --> 04:42:21.138 align:start position:0%
would be used for whether they are
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
being used for post-secondary whether
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:42:25.500 --> 04:42:26.810 align:start position:0%
they are
um

04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
um having the money go
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
wherever the towns people want it I
 
04:42:34.970 --> 04:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
truly because we are not a home rule
 
04:42:36.650 --> 04:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
state and I'm not sure you've had that
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
phrase yet
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
um this is this has to be put in there
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
and allow the towns to be able to do it
 
04:42:47.208 --> 04:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
um so from my standpoint I was trying to
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
make it as flexible as possible so the
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
town would decide what those funds were
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
to be used for and that's why it says
 
04:42:58.208 --> 04:42:58.218 align:start position:0%
for a dedicated scholarship trust fund
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship can be in a number of areas
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gilman
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:43:10.860 --> 04:43:11.390 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
how would this interact with the
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and can
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
somebody get both
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question I don't
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
think it has any connection to the
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
04:43:30.060 --> 04:43:31.070 align:start position:0%
um so I
um

04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:34.490 --> 04:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
I would I would say you know if I Were
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
King yeah you could get both
 
04:43:40.490 --> 04:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
um but it truly is still up to that town
 
04:43:44.690 --> 04:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
to create the parameters here so um
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know you don't see
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here what you can or can't
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
do they they are doing it this is only
 
04:43:56.270 --> 04:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
to give them the permission to to
 
04:43:59.208 --> 04:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
um have a dedicated scholarship fund it
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't set the parameters of of what it
 
04:44:04.970 --> 04:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
can be used for or how it can be used
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:08.170 --> 04:44:08.180 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
04:44:10.490 --> 04:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question Mr
 
04:44:10.500 --> 04:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question Mr
chair

04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
um so I actually represent a Cooperative
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
district and we have many scholarship
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
funds all of those scholarships are from
 
04:44:21.410 --> 04:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
donated money my question is why not
 
04:44:23.810 --> 04:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
just ask your community please donate
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
the money why are you using taxpayers
 
04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
money uh you know which is non-voluntary
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
as opposed to voluntary with a donation
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
04:44:35.340 --> 04:44:36.948 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
um

04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:36.958 --> 04:44:38.628 align:start position:0%
um
I don't

04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know I in an individual Cooperative
 
04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
School District
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
um this seemed the easiest way for one
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
of those towns I I wasn't clear when you
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
were saying that you
 
04:44:52.850 --> 04:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
um are coming from the school district
 
04:44:56.330 --> 04:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
itself or from an individual town but
 
04:44:59.690 --> 04:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
from my individual Town
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I suppose we could but there would be
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
nowhere for those dollars to be held
 
04:45:08.690 --> 04:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's the point of this to have those
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
to have a place for those those dollars
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be held in The Cooperative School
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
District according to our attorney
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
can I ask a follow-up you may
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't the funds that you raised be
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
held within the school district itself
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
they could set up an account and then
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the money is donated into that account
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
under the names of example like if I
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
live in Durham and voluntarily I asked
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
Durham residents can you please donate
 
04:45:39.170 --> 04:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
money to the Durham scholarship fund at
 
04:45:41.810 --> 04:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
the school board or at the school level
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that I could set up an account where
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
that money is transferred in from those
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
donation it would still represent it
 
04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
would still a name be the Durham
 
04:45:52.368 --> 04:45:52.378 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund but the money is all
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
donated instead of being taxed yeah I
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not aware
 
04:46:00.650 --> 04:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
um of of whether that is the appropriate
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
method this was the appropriate method
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
that my town attorney
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
04:46:12.288 --> 04:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:46:14.448 --> 04:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
taking an additional question so to be
 
04:46:17.448 --> 04:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
clear the language in this this bill
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
line four the scholarship
 
04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
it does not imply for academic purposes
 
04:46:28.250 --> 04:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
a scholarship could be awarded for other
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
purposes other than academic in the
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
second parts of that question is is
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
similar with regards to town residents
 
04:46:39.050 --> 04:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
there is no age limit so I mean the a
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship purpose could be for in
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
sorry to say an infant as well as
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
somebody that's that's elderly so that
 
04:46:49.970 --> 04:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
is that a correct interpretation it's
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's wide open with regards to
 
04:46:54.410 --> 04:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
application and the age of the Town
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
resident thank you for your question
 
04:46:56.700 --> 04:46:57.708 align:start position:0%
resident thank you for your question
um

04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:47:13.970 --> 04:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
if the scholarship fund is established
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
exclusively for Town residents
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there is a public school
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
or ready existing there
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
how would it
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
take the tax education tax funds
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
from the existing public schools into
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
this would would that take the money
 
04:47:44.570 --> 04:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
away from the public school education
 
04:47:47.090 --> 04:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
fund into this
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund no I don't believe it
 
04:47:49.560 --> 04:47:51.470 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund no I don't believe it
would

04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
representative service
 
04:47:54.650 --> 04:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question yet another question
 
04:47:57.958 --> 04:47:58.970 align:start position:0%
taking my question yet another question
um

04:47:58.970 --> 04:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
is there meant to be any means testing
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
for this scholarship fund I mean could
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
it go to somebody attending Harvard
 
04:48:07.610 --> 04:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
Business School could it go to somebody
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
attending local trade school what what
 
04:48:11.750 --> 04:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
is the scope
 
04:48:14.570 --> 04:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
of what you're proposing here can
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
somebody earning 5 million dollars a
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
year be eligible
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think the answer is yes
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
um the the answer is as I've said
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
um several times here
 
04:48:31.490 --> 04:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um this is this is open to the town and
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
the town's people to decide what that
 
04:48:36.770 --> 04:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
scholarship money is for all I'm doing
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
is creating the place for it to be put I
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not creating parameters I'm
 
04:48:46.610 --> 04:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
not creating that's that's the towns
 
04:48:49.010 --> 04:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
people need to do that is the way I look
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
at it
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and thank you
 
04:49:00.170 --> 04:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes since the
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
town is going to be paying into this
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
well they have the opportunity to decide
 
04:49:09.650 --> 04:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
who gets the scholarship
 
04:49:11.930 --> 04:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you very much for your
 
04:49:11.940 --> 04:49:13.128 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you very much for your
question

04:49:13.128 --> 04:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:49:13.138 --> 04:49:13.970 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:17.448 --> 04:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
I would say where I doing this in my
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
town that those parameters would be
 
04:49:21.060 --> 04:49:23.810 align:start position:0%
town that those parameters would be
discussed

04:49:23.810 --> 04:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:49:23.820 --> 04:49:25.010 align:start position:0%
discussed
um in

04:49:25.010 --> 04:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
prior to this going into effect
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it would be obviously there's nothing
 
04:49:33.890 --> 04:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
in here that says who is managing this
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
fund who all of those items including
 
04:49:41.208 --> 04:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
your question would be something that
 
04:49:44.170 --> 04:49:44.180 align:start position:0%
the town would decide for themselves
 
04:49:47.810 --> 04:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
and and that's all that this is doing is
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
creating that authorization for them to
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
have that account that's all it's doing
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
04:50:04.850 --> 04:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr representative Hill so a
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
town may never utilize this is that
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:13.970 --> 04:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:50:15.410 --> 04:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you I have one
 
04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.050 --> 04:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh again we have no
 
04:50:31.850 --> 04:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
position on this bill
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
um there's only one thing that the
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee hasn't covered yet that I
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention which was that
 
04:50:41.448 --> 04:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
um uh as written if if this is a warrant
 
04:50:43.730 --> 04:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
article that creates a trust fund I
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's the case that you'd either
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
need to have agents to expend listed in
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
order to you know authorize somebody to
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
hand out these funds or you'd have to
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
have a town meeting vote in order to
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
authorize the expenditure
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
um so you know if I was if I was your
 
04:51:01.128 --> 04:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
town resident eligible to to go to
 
04:51:02.930 --> 04:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
college you wanted to give me a
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship you'd either have to vote a
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
town meeting to authorize that
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
specifically to be paid out to me or you
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
would have to have previously
 
04:51:10.500 --> 04:51:11.690 align:start position:0%
would have to have previously
um

04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
authorize some specific you know the
 
04:51:16.128 --> 04:51:16.138 align:start position:0%
select board or somebody to to set up a
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
system whereby they'd pick whoever could
 
04:51:20.090 --> 04:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
you know be the award recipients for
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
this year so that's the only information
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
I want to provide the committee
 
04:51:26.570 --> 04:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:51:29.330 --> 04:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative priests thank you Mr
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
question shouldn't there be a sunset
 
04:51:34.798 --> 04:51:35.690 align:start position:0%
question shouldn't there be a sunset
um

04:51:35.690 --> 04:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill that says These
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
funds have to be used by a certain date
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
so they just don't go so trust funds
 
04:51:49.128 --> 04:51:49.138 align:start position:0%
don't have a sunset provision they just
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
last forever so your municipality may
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
have some trust funds from 100 years ago
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
particularly in your Cemetery side of
 
04:51:56.400 --> 04:51:57.410 align:start position:0%
particularly in your Cemetery side of
things

04:51:57.410 --> 04:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay and those would be the quests
 
04:51:59.760 --> 04:52:01.730 align:start position:0%
okay and those would be the quests
normally

04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
normally
 
04:52:03.770 --> 04:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
04:52:05.810 --> 04:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
I see none but I have one that I
 
04:52:07.490 --> 04:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
actually should ask to representative it
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
just hit me
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned that
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
we know this is simply a vehicle to
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
allow a town to do it if they should
 
04:52:18.650 --> 04:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
choose but many towns probably won't do
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
it do we have an idea the number of
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
towns that actually already have this in
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
place I'm assuming non-cooperative
 
04:52:26.690 --> 04:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
school districts so about what your town
 
04:52:28.490 --> 04:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
would probably already have in place is
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
a bequest
 
04:52:32.448 --> 04:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
um and I think there's a
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust Foundation our
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division of the ages
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
office told me about one it was down in
 
04:52:39.890 --> 04:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
Peterborough or something like that from
 
04:52:42.410 --> 04:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
about 100 years ago where someone had
 
04:52:46.368 --> 04:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
set up a I believe it was a trust for
 
04:52:49.490 --> 04:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
upon their death a trust for
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh residents school kids of the Town who
 
04:52:55.368 --> 04:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
were Protestants or something and they
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
go through a whole process because you
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
can't restrict based on religion
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
um to to do that so I'm not aware of any
 
04:53:07.730 --> 04:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
towns that would have an existing trust
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
fund created by taxpayer dollars via the
 
04:53:14.570 --> 04:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
war article process it's possible one
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
exists but I'm not aware of one
 
04:53:17.040 --> 04:53:17.628 align:start position:0%
exists but I'm not aware of one
um

04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:20.448 --> 04:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are towns that hold
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
trust funds for educational purposes
 
04:53:27.890 --> 04:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
that are the quests that basically were
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
set up by somebody who was wealthy who
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
then passed away or decided to give the
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
town this money and they they run that
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
that trust but that's something the AG's
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
office could answer better than I could
 
04:53:40.490 --> 04:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.550 --> 04:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
we had one sign in on the blue sheet in
 
04:53:51.708 --> 04:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
favor and that was all on that we'll
 
04:53:56.690 --> 04:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB 293 we are past

and share with you what our days are
 
04:54:44.330 --> 04:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
like and they're not like this uh we we
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
listen to a lot of reports a lot of
 
04:54:47.040 --> 04:54:48.830 align:start position:0%
listen to a lot of reports a lot of
projections

04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
projections
 
04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
um you know some of it can be Doom and
 
04:54:53.330 --> 04:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
Gloom some of it can be exciting and uh
 
04:54:54.530 --> 04:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
make us feel like we have a lot of money
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the bank
 
04:54:57.650 --> 04:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm sure you all
 
04:55:00.170 --> 04:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
are aware of I know you're aware of but
 
04:55:01.610 --> 04:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
emphasized over and over and over again
 
04:55:05.330 --> 04:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
for the last three weeks and our
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee is our aging population
 
04:55:10.850 --> 04:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's to the point where
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population is aging uh
 
04:55:17.810 --> 04:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
almost fastest only second domain in the
 
04:55:21.050 --> 04:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
state in the country so what that looks
 
04:55:25.010 --> 04:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
like as a grander scale in our state
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
is we look at some of the jobs that we
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
have that need to be filled we've got
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of jobs that are
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
unfilled right now in the state of New
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the three sectors that
 
04:55:37.010 --> 04:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
those are primarily located in are
 
04:55:38.530 --> 04:55:38.540 align:start position:0%
Health Care Service
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
and restaurants in retail you could mix
 
04:55:46.570 --> 04:55:46.580 align:start position:0%
those in there as well so these are all
 
04:55:49.610 --> 04:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
areas that are General these are jobs
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
that are generally filled by younger
 
04:55:51.240 --> 04:55:52.010 align:start position:0%
that are generally filled by younger
people

04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:55:55.970 --> 04:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
so this bill HB 294
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
go back a little bit we as a body we
 
04:56:01.850 --> 04:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
have to start getting creative uh within
 
04:56:03.288 --> 04:56:03.298 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here in the state of
 
04:56:05.448 --> 04:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh it's an imperative that
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
we get creative because our our
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
population even in the last 10 years
 
04:56:13.550 --> 04:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
you're ending in 2020 our our young our
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
youth population went down by 10 percent
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we have to start thinking out of the
 
04:56:19.490 --> 04:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
box we have to start thinking of
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
different ways that maybe have not been
 
04:56:22.730 --> 04:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
addressed here in the state of New
 
04:56:26.570 --> 04:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's what HB 294 looks
 
04:56:28.850 --> 04:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
at this is like the last bill we heard
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
of this is an enabling piece of
 
04:56:31.970 --> 04:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislation being that New Hampshire Is
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
Not a Home State uh State the
 
04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to get permission
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
from here to do anything that that may
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
be thinking outside of the box so what
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
HB 294 does like I said it's an enabling
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
piece piece of legislation it doesn't
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
Force municipalities to do anything
 
04:56:50.930 --> 04:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
um Demand on them but if they so choose
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
if the voters of a municipality so so
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
choose to enact a
 
04:57:01.730 --> 04:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
child tax credit
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
they can do that in their state and the
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
point of that would be is to attract
 
04:57:08.350 --> 04:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
people younger people into the community
 
04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
some communities you know Senate are
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Simon and I concede that
 
04:57:16.030 --> 04:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
they may not ever
 
04:57:18.650 --> 04:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
consider it based on the demographics of
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
their computer Community uh the finances
 
04:57:23.448 --> 04:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
of their Community but other communities
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
this might fit very well but the point
 
04:57:30.288 --> 04:57:30.298 align:start position:0%
here today is to ask to get this bill so
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
they can at least have that choice and
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
make that choice on their own
 
04:57:34.920 --> 04:57:36.470 align:start position:0%
make that choice on their own
um

04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:38.690 --> 04:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
if you look at the second part of the
 
04:57:40.010 --> 04:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
bill the first part of the bill
 
04:57:41.628 --> 04:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
addresses the tax credit for property
 
04:57:43.970 --> 04:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
owners with children the second part of
 
04:57:46.970 --> 04:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
the bill uh enables the municipality to
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
extend those tax credits to landlords as
 
04:57:52.490 --> 04:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
an incentive to rent to families with
 
04:57:55.610 --> 04:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
children so we feel that by doing that
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're being you give these
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
municipalities a potential to
 
04:58:06.050 --> 04:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
bring younger people into various types
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
of housing situations
 
04:58:11.810 --> 04:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
um this idea of a carve out tax credit
 
04:58:14.208 --> 04:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
for various segments of the population
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
is not new in New Hampshire uh we
 
04:58:18.650 --> 04:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
currently do it for veterans we do it
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
for elderly so we're not we're not doing
 
04:58:26.570 --> 04:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
something radical here uh with this bill
 
04:58:26.580 --> 04:58:27.470 align:start position:0%
something radical here uh with this bill
um

04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:30.650 --> 04:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that
 
04:58:30.660 --> 04:58:31.490 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that
um

04:58:31.490 --> 04:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
we feel like again I mentioned this way
 
04:58:36.650 --> 04:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
open is by getting these at these
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
younger folks in there we can start
 
04:58:42.410 --> 04:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
filling those jobs and and adding to the
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
success and stability of our of our
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
state overall so that's the that's the
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
outline of the bill again it's nothing
 
04:58:52.128 --> 04:58:52.138 align:start position:0%
we we've done this before with other
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
segments uh it's not something that's
 
04:58:56.810 --> 04:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
forced on the municipalities but by
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
doing this here we give them the option
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
to think outside the box to be creative
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
and work work to try to get some younger
 
04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
folks moving in moving into New
 
04:59:06.298 --> 04:59:07.430 align:start position:0%
folks moving in moving into New
Hampshire

04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:59:07.440 --> 04:59:08.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

04:59:08.090 --> 04:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:10.030 --> 04:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
like I said
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Simon is the primary
 
04:59:14.930 --> 04:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor he's out of town today I'm happy
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
to answer questions but if if we get
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
into something I don't know I'm gonna
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask him to to follow up with
 
04:59:23.810 --> 04:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
you directly but I'd be happy to answer
 
04:59:25.550 --> 04:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:59:32.400 --> 04:59:33.230 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
the other tax exemptions that you
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned for the elderly for veterans
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
are means tested I don't see any means
 
04:59:44.208 --> 04:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
testing in this bill and again the IDE
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
the cons or did I cut you off I'm sorry
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
um hold that thought
 
04:59:51.770 --> 04:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see any means testing
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
which means that I could be
 
04:59:54.958 --> 04:59:55.970 align:start position:0%
which means that I could be
um

04:59:55.970 --> 04:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:01.310 --> 05:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
a landlord that owns 25 duplexes uh and
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
I could say that I'm renting to families
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
with children but I am not I I'm not
 
05:00:10.610 --> 05:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
forced by any law that's stated here to
 
05:00:13.610 --> 05:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
pass that credit through to
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
the renters it would come to me as the
 
05:00:19.850 --> 05:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
landlord so how do we Square no means
 
05:00:23.570 --> 05:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
testing no enforcement mechanism to make
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
sure that the the target is
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's being aimed for is actually being
 
05:00:30.770 --> 05:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
hit yeah
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
so and and how and who pays I'm sorry
 
05:00:37.368 --> 05:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
who pays the question first and then all
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
right I'll follow up all right so to
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
answer your question about the means
 
05:00:42.410 --> 05:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
testing so that that is a that's an
 
05:00:44.810 --> 05:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
excellent question and and we we just
 
05:00:46.610 --> 05:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Simon and I were just
 
05:00:48.050 --> 05:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
talking about that this morning you know
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
how do we uh you know would that be an
 
05:00:54.530 --> 05:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
issue and first of all the guidelines of
 
05:00:56.208 --> 05:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
the tax credit would be left to the
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that would be up to
 
05:01:00.050 --> 05:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
them to develop the criteria under which
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is passed on secondly one of the
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
one of the conversations that we had was
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
or the concerns is that you know it is
 
05:01:14.330 --> 05:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
not passed on to the tax credit but what
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
we found in the research that that
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
senators or representative Simon has has
 
05:01:22.250 --> 05:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
done is that the rent the rents that
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
people pay are paying in in New
 
05:01:26.330 --> 05:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are largely
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
the closing back to well if you give a
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
tax credit is that passed on to the in
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the renter and what his research has
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
has found and I'd be happy to have him
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
follow up to give the sources of the
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
research on that but uh is that the
 
05:01:43.850 --> 05:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
renters or excuse me the rent in New
 
05:01:46.970 --> 05:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is largely based on demand and
 
05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
and it's less based on
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
um property taxes for instance so for
 
05:01:53.890 --> 05:01:53.900 align:start position:0%
instance in Massachusetts
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
05:01:58.610 --> 05:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
comparing Massachusetts in in New
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the property tax rate in
 
05:02:02.930 --> 05:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is much higher than in
 
05:02:05.288 --> 05:02:05.298 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but in Massachusetts
 
05:02:08.448 --> 05:02:08.458 align:start position:0%
equalized it's a much higher the rent is
 
05:02:12.170 --> 05:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
much higher so the the the concept is
 
05:02:16.490 --> 05:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
the rent is largely based on demand and
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
that this tax credit would then
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
um it would indirect as I understand it
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
it would indirectly
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
affect the not not direct the the the
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
landlord is ultimately the one that's
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:02:36.650 --> 05:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
um benefit from the tax credit
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that are
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
opening up their properties to allow
 
05:02:44.090 --> 05:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
younger people in there which oftentimes
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
landlords are reluctant to open those
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
properties up to younger people because
 
05:02:52.490 --> 05:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
of fear of damage decreased property
 
05:02:52.500 --> 05:02:53.628 align:start position:0%
of fear of damage decreased property
value

05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
value
 
05:02:53.638 --> 05:02:54.368 align:start position:0%
value
Etc

05:02:54.368 --> 05:02:54.378 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:02:57.650 --> 05:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
and I know that was a long answer to a
 
05:03:00.410 --> 05:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
short question and uh and and I'd be
 
05:03:02.330 --> 05:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
happy to if if that doesn't answer I'd
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
hey Mr chair
 
05:03:11.280 --> 05:03:12.770 align:start position:0%
hey Mr chair
so

05:03:12.770 --> 05:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:15.850 --> 05:03:15.860 align:start position:0%
this goes to effect
 
05:03:19.730 --> 05:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
towns B and C adopt it
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
who in those towns pays for the credits
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
that go to the child tax credit who does
 
05:03:31.128 --> 05:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
that burden fall on so ultimately so for
 
05:03:32.930 --> 05:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
instance I can speak in in our town when
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
we have an elderly tax credit or a
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
veteran tax credit it's the people of
 
05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
the town that pay for it
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
so they're the ones that are going to be
 
05:03:42.650 --> 05:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
voting to actually
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
put this in place so there you know it's
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be there's gonna the
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
town will decide whether they want to
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
implement something like this so they're
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
making the decision whether they want to
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.490 --> 05:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
question I'm so sorry that we're so late
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
in the day we just could take a long
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
time uh I have two questions really the
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
first one is uh what is a
 
05:04:15.288 --> 05:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
independent a dependent minor child what
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
is there a description for that is it an
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
age thing or what is it I don't know if
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's defined somewhere else in law but I
 
05:04:26.690 --> 05:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
I it you know it's it would refer back
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
to a dependent I I imagine it would
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
refer back to tax code that defines
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
dependent child where a child can be
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
declaimed as a dependent follow-up Mr
 
05:04:40.330 --> 05:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
chairman uh follow up so
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh as we do in the elderly could you
 
05:04:47.810 --> 05:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
could we uh say that uh it would put a
 
05:04:53.570 --> 05:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
we could put a age criteria and is it
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
possible that the program should require
 
05:05:01.448 --> 05:05:01.458 align:start position:0%
that we'd only give this tax relief
 
05:05:04.090 --> 05:05:04.100 align:start position:0%
until the child
 
05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
is in our school system because we pay
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
for them once they get in the school
 
05:05:13.610 --> 05:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
system in you know in the not directly
 
05:05:14.930 --> 05:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
but we're paying for them when they're
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
in the school system would it make some
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
sense to have the program last until the
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
person that the child goes to school so
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying so it depend if I could
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
under just to understand the question
 
05:05:31.128 --> 05:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
it's the way it's written now let me
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
stop you for a second yeah I think we
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's probably going to
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
test somebody that can probably get a
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific it tends to
 
05:05:39.770 --> 05:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
fall into more of a okay I have no
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
problem waiting yeah thank you I think
 
05:05:42.650 --> 05:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
he'd be able to answer it a little bit
 
05:05:46.850 --> 05:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
better uh representative of Manchester
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um if I understand the bill correctly it
 
05:06:00.650 --> 05:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
says the tax credit is either given to
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
the landlord to encourage
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
renters with young children or young
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
families to come in
 
05:06:10.320 --> 05:06:13.070 align:start position:0%
families to come in
or

05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:06:16.430 --> 05:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
young families to buy so that they get
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
what tells us that I could be a landlord
 
05:06:27.050 --> 05:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
take the credit
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
but I may choose who which young family
 
05:06:34.610 --> 05:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
that I can rent it to
 
05:06:37.610 --> 05:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
there is no stipulation of how you could
 
05:06:40.368 --> 05:06:40.378 align:start position:0%
do it so we want to encourage young
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
families youngsters I agree
 
05:06:44.520 --> 05:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
families youngsters I agree
but

05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:49.128 --> 05:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
is there a way that this will be more
 
05:06:52.490 --> 05:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
inclusive representative is there a
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
question yes that's where I was ending
 
05:07:00.970 --> 05:07:00.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair is is there any
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
incentive to include diversity inclusion
 
05:07:05.940 --> 05:07:08.570 align:start position:0%
incentive to include diversity inclusion
irrespective

05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
irrespective
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
families coming in for renting
 
05:07:15.288 --> 05:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question I I
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
think that you know what you bring up is
 
05:07:17.218 --> 05:07:18.490 align:start position:0%
think that you know what you bring up is
is

05:07:18.490 --> 05:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:07:23.330 --> 05:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
a valid and a timely issue the intent of
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
the bill I think is it doesn't go that
 
05:07:29.448 --> 05:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
far uh the the Bill's intent really is
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
to allow municipalities to do this it
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't get into the granularity of
 
05:07:39.050 --> 05:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
defining you know of that so so to
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think that
 
05:07:43.128 --> 05:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
decision would largely be left up to if
 
05:07:45.170 --> 05:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
the bill passes as is it would be
 
05:07:47.690 --> 05:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
largely be left up to the municipalities
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
who either choose or don't choose to to
 
05:07:52.610 --> 05:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
put this type of tax credit into into
 
05:07:52.620 --> 05:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
put this type of tax credit into into
place

05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
 
05:07:59.520 --> 05:08:00.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
question

05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:06.890 --> 05:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.490 --> 05:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
um talking to constituents it's it's the
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
um empty nesters and the elderly that
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
wish to have attacks break because they
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
aren't the ones causing the the high
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
high school taxes
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering uh no one uh
 
05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
that I've ever come in contact with
 
05:08:30.650 --> 05:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
while I was what while I was uh
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative you Keller is there a
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
05:08:36.530 --> 05:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
um no one I've that I've ever come in
 
05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
contact with has asked you know for
 
05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
um tax break for the people that are
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
used utilizing the school system which
 
05:08:46.610 --> 05:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
cause 80 of the taxes
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
what are what were the reasons or how
 
05:08:53.448 --> 05:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
many people I guess came to you to ask
 
05:08:56.330 --> 05:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
for this to be like that they needed
 
05:08:59.150 --> 05:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
that this uh law to be passed so that
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
they could Institute this or is this
 
05:09:02.160 --> 05:09:03.470 align:start position:0%
they could Institute this or is this
just

05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
another way of trying to uh get young
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
people into the community yeah so thank
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
you for your question
 
05:09:10.920 --> 05:09:11.948 align:start position:0%
you for your question
um

05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:13.850 --> 05:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Simon is the primary
 
05:09:16.208 --> 05:09:16.218 align:start position:0%
sponsors that he'd probably have the the
 
05:09:19.368 --> 05:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
specifics on that I signed on as a
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of more uh of a general
 
05:09:25.490 --> 05:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
concept idea of this you know
 
05:09:28.850 --> 05:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
um personally I I thought this was a
 
05:09:32.288 --> 05:09:32.298 align:start position:0%
unique and and and engine
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
ingenious type of thinking in order to
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
attract younger people personally that
 
05:09:40.250 --> 05:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know as far as how he got to the
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
point of putting this to paper you'd
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
have to ask him you know where that but
 
05:09:46.610 --> 05:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
that's that's the background why I
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
supported that
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gallagher
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:09:55.570 --> 05:09:55.580 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
05:09:58.750 --> 05:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
expanded its own tax credit I think it
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
was as part of one of the covid relief
 
05:10:07.368 --> 05:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
packages or something
 
05:10:07.378 --> 05:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
packages or something
um

05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:08.160 --> 05:10:09.350 align:start position:0%
um
which

05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
was in fact in effect for about a year
 
05:10:13.680 --> 05:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
was in fact in effect for about a year
until

05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
it expired and failed to be renewed
 
05:10:21.890 --> 05:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
um just due to disagreement so I was
 
05:10:21.900 --> 05:10:23.150 align:start position:0%
um just due to disagreement so I was
wondering

05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
05:10:23.160 --> 05:10:24.170 align:start position:0%
wondering
um

05:10:24.170 --> 05:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:24.180 --> 05:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
um
if

05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:10:28.368 --> 05:10:28.378 align:start position:0%
you looked into how the
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
debate over the federal child tax credit
 
05:10:34.250 --> 05:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
laid out in the last few years when
 
05:10:37.250 --> 05:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
studying this uh Bill and how that might
 
05:10:39.410 --> 05:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
have informed it and if you could
 
05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
compare and contrast
 
05:10:44.930 --> 05:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill with the federal child tax
 
05:10:44.940 --> 05:10:46.850 align:start position:0%
um this bill with the federal child tax
credit

05:10:46.850 --> 05:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
yet thank you this bill is really it's a
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
little different than the federal
 
05:10:55.368 --> 05:10:55.378 align:start position:0%
child tax credit and that this is a New
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Centric bill this is a this is
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
a a bill that would be unique to New
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's actually a
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipality-centric bill so the point
 
05:11:08.570 --> 05:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh is really more to
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
attract people in and get young people
 
05:11:14.270 --> 05:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire into certain towns
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
rather than give a break for you know
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
just a break for anybody that has a
 
05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
child it's really to incentivize folks
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
to come to come to New Hampshire and uh
 
05:11:25.490 --> 05:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
and and if the municipality chooses to
 
05:11:30.970 --> 05:11:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:32.770 --> 05:11:32.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.050 --> 05:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'm curious was there a fiscal analysis
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
done on this to see how much this would
 
05:11:52.368 --> 05:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
so again the the point of the bill the
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
objective of the bill is because we're
 
05:12:00.350 --> 05:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
like Dylan's law not a home state I
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
realize that exactly you know the whole
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
concept was really to let the state give
 
05:12:08.090 --> 05:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
the authorization for the municipalities
 
05:12:10.010 --> 05:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
to do this I would imagine if a
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
municipality decides to go down that
 
05:12:14.810 --> 05:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
road I know in my in my town we would
 
05:12:16.490 --> 05:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know if we did that there would be a
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
lot of scrutiny on the financial uh
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
implications of that but on a on a
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
global level here because we don't know
 
05:12:25.788 --> 05:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
which states which towns would do it
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
Which towns wouldn't do it
 
05:12:31.250 --> 05:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
we concede the fact that there may be no
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
Towns at all that take advantage of this
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
if we pass this
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but uh so so
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
to answer your question no there was not
 
05:12:42.890 --> 05:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
a financial analysis done but I imagine
 
05:12:45.170 --> 05:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
prior to adopting something like this
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality that's that's debating
 
05:12:52.250 --> 05:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
are the questions I see representative
 
05:12:54.840 --> 05:12:56.090 align:start position:0%
are the questions I see representative
Gilman

05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
Gilman
 
05:12:57.708 --> 05:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:12:59.208 --> 05:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:13:01.610 --> 05:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the same one I asked
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
before how will this work with education
 
05:13:07.490 --> 05:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts or is that a decision
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
for the community to make because this
 
05:13:13.190 --> 05:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
is enabling again this is a 60 000 foot
 
05:13:16.250 --> 05:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
view a bill which is just the enabling
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
of that when it get when you drill down
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
into the granularity of
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
functionality policy where the money's
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
going is it financially viable that
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be a decision for the
 
05:13:31.610 --> 05:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities to make thank
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Powell
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your bill
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
introduction you cited that the bill
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
would serve as an incentive for land law
 
05:13:47.570 --> 05:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
Lords to rent to families with children
 
05:13:49.788 --> 05:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns that perhaps
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
maybe if this bill were to become law
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
and municipalities did in fact adopt it
 
05:13:59.650 --> 05:13:59.660 align:start position:0%
that it would create a problem for
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
families without children say elderly to
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
have access or the ability to rent due
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
to this incentive
 
05:14:14.570 --> 05:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
for landlords to rent to families with
 
05:14:14.580 --> 05:14:16.190 align:start position:0%
for landlords to rent to families with
children

05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:14:17.810 --> 05:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
so so if I understand your question
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
right the concern is if this becomes law
 
05:14:24.010 --> 05:14:24.020 align:start position:0%
we'd be essentially bringing in
 
05:14:26.208 --> 05:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
displacing elderly because there'd be so
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
many children come younger families is
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
that is that the so that's uh
 
05:14:37.368 --> 05:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that that was a couldn't
 
05:14:40.730 --> 05:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
I I can say that that personally that
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
wasn't a concern because that's so far
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
from where we are right now uh we'd have
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
to really change wholesome makes
 
05:14:51.050 --> 05:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
wholesale changes to the demographic of
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
our state and the trends of our state to
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
get to that point so
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know speaking for myself that's not
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh in New Hampshire the majority
 
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
of school funding is paid for by local
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
property tax and I always had a hard
 
05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
time believing that but the majority of
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
our residents actually don't have kids
 
05:15:22.730 --> 05:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
in school and so therefore the residents
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
that don't have kids in school are
 
05:15:26.690 --> 05:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
currently subsidizing the families that
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
have kids in our school so for example
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
like Oyster River it's twenty thousand
 
05:15:33.530 --> 05:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
dollars to pay for a student the state
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'll be generous puts in maybe seven or
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
eight thousand the majority of that is
 
05:15:40.730 --> 05:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
coming out to our residents so in other
 
05:15:42.530 --> 05:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
words this is almost like double dipping
 
05:15:44.810 --> 05:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh do you have concern that this would
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
cause a backlash that would then affect
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to pass your school budgets
 
05:15:48.540 --> 05:15:51.650 align:start position:0%
the ability to pass your school budgets
so

05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.810 --> 05:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
when we originally were talking about
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
this bill that was a topic exact topic
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
that we we brought up and and I think
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the way I rationalize this and the
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
way I I came to having a a comfort level
 
05:16:08.448 --> 05:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
was this is the communities are going to
 
05:16:10.490 --> 05:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
be their own safety valve you you know
 
05:16:11.690 --> 05:16:11.700 align:start position:0%
the communities will have to vote to
 
05:16:14.448 --> 05:16:14.458 align:start position:0%
adopt this so
 
05:16:18.650 --> 05:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
I I know for fact I represent six
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
communities and not all six would ever
 
05:16:24.288 --> 05:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
choose to go down this road for that
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
exact reason uh uh and and that's really
 
05:16:30.770 --> 05:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know the people and their vote and
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
their town meeting process and uh and
 
05:16:38.330 --> 05:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
and that debate is really where I came
 
05:16:40.850 --> 05:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
to understand that's our safety valve
 
05:16:43.730 --> 05:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that that uh
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know in kind of poking holes in
 
05:16:47.930 --> 05:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
this that was one of the holes that I
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
found but again I think because the
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
people this is this is not coming from
 
05:16:53.208 --> 05:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
the state telling them you have to do it
 
05:16:55.730 --> 05:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
these are the communities who know their
 
05:16:57.708 --> 05:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
budgets who know the the school
 
05:17:00.288 --> 05:17:00.298 align:start position:0%
populations who know and they're going
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
to be the ones that are voting on it so
 
05:17:02.820 --> 05:17:03.590 align:start position:0%
to be the ones that are voting on it so
um

05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's how I came to feel more
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that that would not
 
05:17:08.570 --> 05:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
happen because the communities where
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's where there's a potential for
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
that won't won't go down that road with
 
05:17:12.600 --> 05:17:18.250 align:start position:0%
that won't won't go down that road with
this

05:17:18.250 --> 05:17:18.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
05:17:22.550 --> 05:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking that
 
05:17:22.560 --> 05:17:23.868 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking that
question

05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:23.878 --> 05:17:25.128 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:17:25.128 --> 05:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of opposition at the local level
 
05:17:32.890 --> 05:17:32.900 align:start position:0%
to development especially for for uh
 
05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
Apartments is that it's going to
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
overload the schools and it's going to
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
be very expensive you know per person
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
do you see any disconnect for the
 
05:17:49.730 --> 05:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
increasing of our housing issue with um
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
if you if this was to pass the there
 
05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
would be even a there would be an
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
incentive for the landlord to seek out
 
05:17:59.280 --> 05:18:01.070 align:start position:0%
incentive for the landlord to seek out
those

05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:18:03.770 --> 05:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
um younger people with kids so that that
 
05:18:06.288 --> 05:18:06.298 align:start position:0%
they could get the incentive and from
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
the municipalities perspective they
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to have additional housing
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
because the fear that there's going to
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
be more people in school and so
 
05:18:21.530 --> 05:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
do you see this as a as a potential uh
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
one of the negative drawbacks would be
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
that there would be reduced
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
um housing
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
um you know development because of of
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of Disconnect of incentives
 
05:18:37.490 --> 05:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
so uh and I the way I just make sure I
 
05:18:39.050 --> 05:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
understood your question because I think
 
05:18:41.208 --> 05:18:41.218 align:start position:0%
the question that you're the that you're
 
05:18:43.730 --> 05:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
posing is a common concern when you give
 
05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
housing increase housing of younger
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
people and if I totally missed it let me
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to be offended by
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that but the way I understood it was
 
05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:18:55.850 --> 05:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
um by bringing in younger populations
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe to multi-family units you're
 
05:19:01.550 --> 05:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to put a burden on the schools in
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
in was that and you're going to hurt the
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
school budgets with younger
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
can I can clarify if you yeah that was
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you um I uh I was saying that
 
05:19:16.250 --> 05:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
the that when someone is trying to
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
develop something the municipality is
 
05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
concerned of how that development is
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
going to impact the school population
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
and aka the school budget and from the
 
05:19:28.610 --> 05:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
developer standpoint they want to have
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
those those people in there because then
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
they could get this tax credit if this
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
was to pass so that's kind of differing
 
05:19:36.650 --> 05:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
incentives absolutely so that's a common
 
05:19:38.570 --> 05:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
concern I've heard that a lot you know
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
just in my town right now I know there's
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
a project that hasn't been announced
 
05:19:44.330 --> 05:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
publicly but it'll be a hundred units
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
coming to town and even in in the
 
05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
conversations that I've had or well geez
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to flood the schools you
 
05:19:52.730 --> 05:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna you're gonna crush the
 
05:19:56.330 --> 05:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
schools but here's why that logic is
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a little flawed actually in fact
 
05:19:59.448 --> 05:19:59.458 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire realtors association
 
05:20:02.570 --> 05:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
did a study on this with UNH and they
 
05:20:04.368 --> 05:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
found that even though it kind of makes
 
05:20:06.050 --> 05:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
sense you're putting all these kids into
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
the schools and actually I would
 
05:20:10.010 --> 05:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to go on to go to the
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire realtors association and
 
05:20:13.250 --> 05:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
see it they've got a they've got a uh
 
05:20:14.810 --> 05:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
they've got a video presentation of the
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
findings of the result the the the
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
reason what they're fine what they found
 
05:20:22.490 --> 05:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
why that is and this is contrary to what
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
I personally have had always thought but
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
now you think of it there are fixed
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
costs with schools that are never going
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
to go away you still have to have the
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
building there you still have to heat it
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
you still have to have the teachers
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
there so there's a certain level of
 
05:20:37.368 --> 05:20:37.378 align:start position:0%
overhead that regardless of how many
 
05:20:39.410 --> 05:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
students you have in a school is going
 
05:20:41.570 --> 05:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
to remain constant yeah you may have to
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
have some specials you may have to have
 
05:20:44.930 --> 05:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
some more you know some some some
 
05:20:46.730 --> 05:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
special ad
 
05:20:50.208 --> 05:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
um but the the increase in the school
 
05:20:52.368 --> 05:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
population and again this is done by the
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is the the findings of the New
 
05:20:56.030 --> 05:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Realtor Association is not
 
05:20:58.730 --> 05:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
directly proportionate to the amount
 
05:21:02.208 --> 05:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
that you spend on education so yeah that
 
05:21:04.010 --> 05:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
is a common that is a common objection
 
05:21:05.570 --> 05:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
when you look at these types of
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
developments but I think as we've
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
started to look into those a little bit
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that even myself held at one
 
05:21:15.240 --> 05:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
concerns that even myself held at one
time

05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
are proving to be uh wrong because the
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
reality is we're in again in my
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
community we're still Staffing at a
 
05:21:26.810 --> 05:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
level that we were 10 years ago and
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's five to ten percent less kids in
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
the school so we still have a capacity
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
of five to ten percent to bring it up to
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
what it was 10 years ago and and then
 
05:21:37.610 --> 05:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overhead costs that
 
05:21:40.250 --> 05:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
remain the same that regardless if you
 
05:21:43.128 --> 05:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
put in 10 15 more kids again I've live
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
in a small town it's not going to change
 
05:21:48.050 --> 05:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of the school so
 
05:21:49.610 --> 05:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage you know anyone
 
05:21:51.708 --> 05:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
who's interested in this that was a
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
fascinating uh presentation is done by
 
05:21:56.090 --> 05:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire realtors association
 
05:21:58.550 --> 05:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
with UNH and they have it posted on
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
their website but um thank you very much
 
05:22:03.410 --> 05:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
further questions we have four more
 
05:22:05.330 --> 05:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
individuals that we need to get going on
 
05:22:07.070 --> 05:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
here seeing none
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:38.810 --> 05:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
oh it has to be red that's
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive this is uh this is not
 
05:22:43.010 --> 05:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
cornerstone's first time in front of
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
this committee but this is my first time
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee I'm general
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
counsel at Cornerstone which is a
 
05:22:51.410 --> 05:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
Christian advocacy organization and that
 
05:22:53.150 --> 05:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
is of course the driving reason that we
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
support any pronatal pro-family policy
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
but we think that as representative
 
05:23:00.410 --> 05:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
roachford somewhat outlined even people
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
that don't share particularly our views
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the family should be concerned about
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
the demographic situation in New
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative roachford
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we are the second most
 
05:23:12.650 --> 05:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
elderly state in the country after Maine
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
we're also the second fastest aging
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
State and really on any important metric
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
of demographic health that you can look
 
05:23:22.490 --> 05:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
at we are either the worst off state in
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
the country or we're in the bottom three
 
05:23:26.570 --> 05:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
so for example we've also had the
 
05:23:28.550 --> 05:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
largest single largest 10-year decrease
 
05:23:30.770 --> 05:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
in Children of any state in the United
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
States and for the children who do stay
 
05:23:35.090 --> 05:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
and are raised in New Hampshire we have
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
the single highest rate of students who
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
leave the state graduating high school
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
seniors who leave the state and a
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
majority of those never return then when
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the the 20 to 40 year olds
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
my demographic who are in New Hampshire
 
05:23:51.288 --> 05:23:51.298 align:start position:0%
a third of them say that they are likely
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
to leave the state and only 19 percent
 
05:23:55.490 --> 05:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
of 20 to 40 year olds say they feel
 
05:23:57.650 --> 05:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
committed to remaining in the state so
 
05:23:59.288 --> 05:23:59.298 align:start position:0%
obviously this is completely
 
05:24:01.010 --> 05:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
unsustainable which is why as
 
05:24:02.690 --> 05:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford said we need to
 
05:24:05.690 --> 05:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
think of innovative solutions
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and really ultimately the people who
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be the most harmed by this
 
05:24:10.850 --> 05:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
demographic trend in New Hampshire are
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
the elderly and to illustrate that point
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
in less than 10 years Carroll County in
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is going to have a
 
05:24:20.750 --> 05:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
majority over 65 population and to
 
05:24:23.208 --> 05:24:23.218 align:start position:0%
emphasize how alarming and how important
 
05:24:25.490 --> 05:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
that should be there is currently only
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
one uh documented majority over 65
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
County in America and it's Sumter County
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
Florida West of Orlando and it's a
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
disaster on paper it looks economically
 
05:24:38.330 --> 05:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
well off the money is there the job
 
05:24:40.850 --> 05:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
openings are there but the job openings
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
including for essential services are
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
flat out not being filled and so people
 
05:24:46.490 --> 05:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
that have cardiac arrests for example
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
can wait for an hour and 20 minutes for
 
05:24:51.890 --> 05:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
an ambulance to arrive one reason we
 
05:24:53.810 --> 05:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
think a bill like this would be an
 
05:24:55.730 --> 05:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate part of the solution and a
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction is that our
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
demographic crisis in New Hampshire is
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
really government created we've had
 
05:25:04.850 --> 05:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
Decades of New Hampshire policy and
 
05:25:07.610 --> 05:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
especially policy in communities really
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
designed to make to depress the number
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
of young families in New Hampshire
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the belief that we would say is
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
completely mistaken that that will
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
decrease school taxes
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative yokella
 
05:25:22.250 --> 05:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
of course the school taxes are the main
 
05:25:24.890 --> 05:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
driver of taxes in general where we
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
might have a difference of understanding
 
05:25:28.970 --> 05:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
as we would say enrollment in schools is
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
not what's driving those school taxes um
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
and you know we've seen for example in
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
communities that have really tried to
 
05:25:37.330 --> 05:25:37.340 align:start position:0%
depress the number of young families
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
Pelham until a couple of years ago they
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
were trying to keep the number of young
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
families as low as possible what was
 
05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
happening was that the cost to services
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
in incurred by residents of
 
05:25:51.288 --> 05:25:51.298 align:start position:0%
age-restricted housing actually exceeded
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
the property taxes on the age-restricted
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
housing units because of our our
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
one-sided elderly tax abatement that we
 
05:26:00.830 --> 05:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
have and then meanwhile of course the
 
05:26:02.448 --> 05:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
school enrollment was going down School
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
enrollments are going down everywhere
 
05:26:06.050 --> 05:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
but I think we can all kind of see that
 
05:26:07.730 --> 05:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
school enrollment is not the driver of
 
05:26:09.890 --> 05:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
school taxes because school taxes are of
 
05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
course still going up
 
05:26:15.050 --> 05:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
so uh we hope that this will be a step
 
05:26:16.550 --> 05:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and we hope that
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
it will continue to get some bipartisan
 
05:26:19.440 --> 05:26:20.270 align:start position:0%
it will continue to get some bipartisan
support

05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
um you know on the one hand this would
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
fix a bias built into our state law in
 
05:26:26.750 --> 05:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what municipalities can do
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
against younger families it would
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
increase local Choice increase
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
competition and of course it's an
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
abatement on your own taxes and then on
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
the other hand as representative
 
05:26:39.730 --> 05:26:39.740 align:start position:0%
Gallagher mentioned there was the
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
expanded federal child tax credit which
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
was not renewed in the most recent
 
05:26:46.850 --> 05:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill and that was principally a
 
05:26:49.150 --> 05:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
democratic priority although it had some
 
05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and and one
 
05:26:53.208 --> 05:26:53.218 align:start position:0%
interesting thing I'll note in closing
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
on that expanded child tax credit at the
 
05:26:57.650 --> 05:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
federal level is the research is now
 
05:27:00.770 --> 05:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
very conclusive that unlike some of the
 
05:27:03.410 --> 05:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
other covid relief that we saw the
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal expanded child tax credit did
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
not decrease labor participation at all
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
it just reduced poverty I'd be happy to
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions I have spoken with
 
05:27:16.128 --> 05:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor about this
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Simon who's
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
unavailable and I I can do my best to
 
05:27:22.490 --> 05:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
answer some legal questions as well
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do you have you you didn't
 
05:27:31.970 --> 05:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
have your mic on so I would I didn't
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
know if you would just hand your hand
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
got three no I'm okay
 
05:27:39.650 --> 05:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
that I had operated on Mr chamber not
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
this one thing
 
05:27:44.570 --> 05:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking our
 
05:27:46.490 --> 05:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
questions we're kind of in a little
 
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
silly this time of day
 
05:27:52.190 --> 05:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
um we it's been said earlier that uh you
 
05:27:54.050 --> 05:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
know about the elderly and I happen to
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
be in that category uh and what we do
 
05:27:58.970 --> 05:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
for the elderly and you know and I think
 
05:28:03.050 --> 05:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
that's well taken but I think we could
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it's possible or
 
05:28:08.090 --> 05:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
would they would you consider uh in this
 
05:28:13.250 --> 05:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
bill a the taking that as a a way of a
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
speech to go down by uh limiting the
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
amount of Maintenance that would make it
 
05:28:21.410 --> 05:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
more compatible for the townspeople if
 
05:28:23.628 --> 05:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
you'd if you had it at fifty thousand
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
dollars until instead of you know five
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and if you put
 
05:28:31.310 --> 05:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
a limited limit on the cage the age of
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the child that's why I asked earlier
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
what is a dependent minor uh if we
 
05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
limited that to one to from them one
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
year old to when they go to school
 
05:28:45.708 --> 05:28:45.718 align:start position:0%
because when they go to school we pick
 
05:28:48.590 --> 05:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
up the you know we I'm talking about
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
selling it and then uh well then if you
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
had how about three questions at a time
 
05:28:54.240 --> 05:28:55.310 align:start position:0%
had how about three questions at a time
representative

05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:28:57.230 --> 05:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
let's say let's go with those first my
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
question really is with all the irsas in
 
05:28:59.700 --> 05:29:00.530 align:start position:0%
question really is with all the irsas in
this

05:29:00.530 --> 05:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:29:04.550 --> 05:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill could we take that direction in
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
setting this up as a community
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you asked that I have spoken to
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Simon about that I I
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
should say at the outset the current
 
05:29:17.390 --> 05:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions are modeled on RSA 7239b and
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
some related rsas in the elderly tax
 
05:29:22.128 --> 05:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
credit the elderly tax credit gives
 
05:29:24.288 --> 05:29:24.298 align:start position:0%
municipalities pretty broad authority to
 
05:29:26.448 --> 05:29:26.458 align:start position:0%
determine what the the dollar amount per
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
credit would be and so I know
 
05:29:30.170 --> 05:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative Simon wanted to just
 
05:29:32.510 --> 05:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
start with designating as Broad and
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
Authority as possible to municipalities
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
to make decisions in terms of what's
 
05:29:39.288 --> 05:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them but he has told me
 
05:29:42.410 --> 05:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
he would certainly be open to if the
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee saw fit at to build in some
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
more constraints
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
um and you know parameters on the scope
 
05:29:51.410 --> 05:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
of the bill that he would be open to
 
05:29:53.690 --> 05:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
that and certainly From cornerstone's
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
perspective as long as as the bill is
 
05:29:58.430 --> 05:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
significantly pronatal and is an
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
incentive kind of pushing in this
 
05:30:01.550 --> 05:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
direction an incentive to attract and
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
retain younger families we we would
 
05:30:05.930 --> 05:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
probably look positively on the kinds of
 
05:30:07.730 --> 05:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
parameters that that you mentioned if
 
05:30:09.530 --> 05:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
there was an appetite for that a quick
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman if I could it's
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
just is
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
if I can let's let's go um what I'm
 
05:30:18.350 --> 05:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to do I want to have a little bit
 
05:30:20.448 --> 05:30:20.458 align:start position:0%
of discussion at the end of today but uh
 
05:30:22.910 --> 05:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
let's um
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
if your follow-up is truly a follow-up
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
yes what we've been tending to do here
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
is asking multiple questions of
 
05:30:31.250 --> 05:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
different questions and I would prefer
 
05:30:33.410 --> 05:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
to have each individual ask a question
 
05:30:37.070 --> 05:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
and then tell everybody else has spoken
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
um then we can go back if it's a true
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes you may follow up yeah
 
05:30:42.708 --> 05:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's a yes and no
 
05:30:47.090 --> 05:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
answer is representative Simon uh a
 
05:30:49.250 --> 05:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
receptive to putting this in a study
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee where we could the bill could
 
05:30:53.570 --> 05:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
be more comprehensive
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
I I expect his answer to that would be
 
05:30:57.170 --> 05:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
no but I haven't asked him that question
 
05:30:57.180 --> 05:30:58.490 align:start position:0%
no but I haven't asked him that question
specifically

05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:30:58.500 --> 05:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
specifically
representative

05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:31:04.250 --> 05:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
question should you please define for me
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
the term pronatal
 
05:31:08.810 --> 05:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
oh sure just uh encouragement of
 
05:31:11.448 --> 05:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
children basically is pronatal natal
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
means birth though
 
05:31:17.708 --> 05:31:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.970 --> 05:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said in your
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this would if this bill
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
passed it would help with competition I
 
05:31:31.550 --> 05:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't understand that can you define
 
05:31:31.560 --> 05:31:32.570 align:start position:0%
don't understand that can you define
that

05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:34.368 --> 05:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
sure what I meant there was competition
 
05:31:36.288 --> 05:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
between municipalities
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we we just heard a lot about
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
how municipalities would sort of be
 
05:31:40.850 --> 05:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
under some pressure to set the
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
parameters most appropriate for them and
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
so we could sort of have a Marketplace
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
of ideas in terms of how municipalities
 
05:31:50.208 --> 05:31:50.218 align:start position:0%
go about trying to attract younger
 
05:31:53.270 --> 05:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
families uh and we we have seen multiple
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
communities in the last couple years in
 
05:31:57.170 --> 05:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire trying different things in
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
order in an attempt to attract younger
 
05:32:01.490 --> 05:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
families I mentioned Pelham a moment ago
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
they have now actually got so bad there
 
05:32:05.208 --> 05:32:05.218 align:start position:0%
they've prohibited new age-restricted
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
housing so these are uh the kinds of
 
05:32:09.170 --> 05:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
things that some communities are trying
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
to do and the idea here is to expand the
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
options that they have and then let
 
05:32:16.490 --> 05:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
communities compete amongst themselves
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
to a degree to find out what strategies
 
05:32:22.990 --> 05:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
05:32:29.570 --> 05:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
hi um so I'd just like to follow up
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
um about your mention of the
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
debate over the federal expanded federal
 
05:32:38.448 --> 05:32:38.458 align:start position:0%
trial tax credit uh so did
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone New Hampshire
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh take a position on that policy while
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
the debate was still happening or is
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
this just something that you've realized
 
05:32:56.990 --> 05:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
was good now retrospectively
 
05:32:58.690 --> 05:32:58.700 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the federal
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of the child tax credit we
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't take positions on any federal
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
um issues so no no federal legislation
 
05:33:07.610 --> 05:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
have we to ever to my knowledge have we
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
ever taken a position on
 
05:33:11.628 --> 05:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
um but you know we we think there are
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
constructive aspects of the federal per
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
child tax credit and I I am aware that
 
05:33:19.128 --> 05:33:19.138 align:start position:0%
that the existence of that program some
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
is something that played into the
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
creation of this bill at the outset okay
 
05:33:24.840 --> 05:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
creation of this bill at the outset okay
thanks

05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Ian thank you
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call now uh
 
05:33:47.650 --> 05:33:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:33:51.650 --> 05:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
this is my first time in any situation
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
like this so please forgive me
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
um before you get going
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
um pull that mic closer to you so he can
 
05:33:59.330 --> 05:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
hear you really well
 
05:34:01.850 --> 05:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
and then also before you start please
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
let us know if you're for or against the
 
05:34:06.650 --> 05:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
bill yeah my name is Angel I'm for the
 
05:34:06.660 --> 05:34:08.208 align:start position:0%
bill yeah my name is Angel I'm for the
bill

05:34:08.208 --> 05:34:08.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I am a homeowner as well as a um
 
05:34:13.250 --> 05:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
Homeowner of multi-family as well as a
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh a parent of three young ones which is
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
where my wife is now she's gonna come
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
testify but
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think the I think the bill is
 
05:34:24.890 --> 05:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
a great incentive point for families
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
um to come into the state
 
05:34:29.090 --> 05:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
um for a multi multiple reasons for one
 
05:34:32.330 --> 05:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
as a um as a man with
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
um with a family who owns a home and
 
05:34:38.208 --> 05:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
whatnot we um it's it's difficult to try
 
05:34:40.490 --> 05:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
to own a home in the first place
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
um especially what we talked about as
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
far as like the high taxes and stuff
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
like that I'm from Massachusetts so I
 
05:34:46.850 --> 05:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
was blown away when I came up here for
 
05:34:48.650 --> 05:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
the uh and I saw the tax rates and
 
05:34:51.708 --> 05:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
whatnot but so it's it's that's a great
 
05:34:53.570 --> 05:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
incentive in and of itself that it could
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
provide that relief for families
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
um as well as
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
um as a landlord
 
05:35:01.500 --> 05:35:03.110 align:start position:0%
um as a landlord
um

05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:05.810 --> 05:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
I heard it said earlier today um earlier
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the meeting and it's this place of
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
like when you're thinking about renting
 
05:35:10.850 --> 05:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
your own home and your own property that
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're then therefore gonna have to fix
 
05:35:15.170 --> 05:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
thinking about renting to people with
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
children especially young children is a
 
05:35:19.250 --> 05:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
absolute nightmare
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so this this can also provide much
 
05:35:22.920 --> 05:35:23.628 align:start position:0%
um so this this can also provide much
um

05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:26.208 --> 05:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh just leeway and almost security and
 
05:35:28.970 --> 05:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
what uh in a sense for for landlords as
 
05:35:31.550 --> 05:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
well to rent to young families
 
05:35:31.560 --> 05:35:32.390 align:start position:0%
well to rent to young families
um

05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:34.250 --> 05:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
especially once you start getting into
 
05:35:36.530 --> 05:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know higher numbers of families and
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
stuff like that a higher numbers of
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
children in families
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
um you know to find housing for anything
 
05:35:44.448 --> 05:35:44.458 align:start position:0%
more than a two bedroom is extremely
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to find housing more than
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms is even more difficult
 
05:35:49.490 --> 05:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so just for as far as like a rental
 
05:35:54.050 --> 05:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
or looking for renters for people who
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford
 
05:35:58.010 --> 05:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
um to go into a home I think it's a
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
great incentive for landlords to think
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
about you know instead of bringing it to
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
an Airbnb or you know sell or short-term
 
05:36:04.320 --> 05:36:05.390 align:start position:0%
an Airbnb or you know sell or short-term
rental

05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
rental
 
05:36:08.510 --> 05:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I just think it's a great incentive
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:36:11.810 --> 05:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Rosales
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Angel for uh your testimony
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
here today I congratulate you for being
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
here and doing such a good job uh I'm of
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
the belief that are there are people
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
like you that are the future of New
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I would hope that you
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
would agree with me that whenever a
 
05:36:34.850 --> 05:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
state or a municipality loses its young
 
05:36:34.860 --> 05:36:36.128 align:start position:0%
state or a municipality loses its young
kids

05:36:36.128 --> 05:36:36.138 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:36:40.490 --> 05:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
that state or that municipality is
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
liable to die
 
05:36:46.250 --> 05:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
I have seen that in my history and I I
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
think I'm a an old disabled veteran I
 
05:36:55.550 --> 05:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
get tax abatements out the in-gang so
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
many that I don't deserve but I take
 
05:37:01.368 --> 05:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
them I don't need them but there are
 
05:37:04.850 --> 05:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
people like you that the question is do
 
05:37:08.410 --> 05:37:08.420 align:start position:0%
you agree with me that we need
 
05:37:11.350 --> 05:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
abatements like that for young people
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely that was great
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
well said as well um but yeah absolutely
 
05:37:18.650 --> 05:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
you know they it's said by many and many
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
people that a uh the future of a
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
generation is its young people if there
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
is no young people then there is no
 
05:37:24.480 --> 05:37:26.330 align:start position:0%
is no young people then there is no
future

05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:37:28.128 --> 05:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:32.170 --> 05:37:32.180 align:start position:0%
just for the record representative
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
only because you rarely speak did I not
 
05:37:39.550 --> 05:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.330 --> 05:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.730 --> 05:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:37:48.650 --> 05:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
being here today isn't it true we've
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony today about not
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to rent two families or children
 
05:37:54.050 --> 05:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that's illegal
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
I guess I actually don't specifically
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
know I'm not the Fair Housing Act made
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
that label but I could be wrong thank
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
you representative priest
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
05:38:11.448 --> 05:38:11.458 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
angel you're from Massachusetts
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you've been I'm sorry
 
05:38:17.160 --> 05:38:17.868 align:start position:0%
um you've been I'm sorry
um

05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:20.448 --> 05:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
do you think other young families like
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
yourself will move here
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
to take jobs in healthcare restaurants
 
05:38:30.770 --> 05:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
and Retail knowing that our wage level
 
05:38:34.368 --> 05:38:34.378 align:start position:0%
is so much lower than anybody else
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was I just I didn't hear
 
05:38:37.730 --> 05:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
that last part knowing that our Witch
 
05:38:40.490 --> 05:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
level is wage levels
 
05:38:43.010 --> 05:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
are so much lower than anybody else in
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
the region before they witness please do
 
05:38:47.330 --> 05:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
not answer that we try to maintain our
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative priests to the
 
05:38:52.490 --> 05:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
subject at hand and this is a child tax
 
05:38:55.490 --> 05:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
credit not a wage wage debates are
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
usually in Labor uh Mr chairman I agree
 
05:39:02.448 --> 05:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
with you that this is a tax credit but
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing about how this has
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
been this will be an incentive to bring
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
in young people to the state with
 
05:39:13.368 --> 05:39:13.378 align:start position:0%
children and I'm just saying why would
 
05:39:15.650 --> 05:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
they want to move here and take a
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that thank you that's a
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
nice statement but we will move on to
 
05:39:23.810 --> 05:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
the next question anybody representative
 
05:39:23.820 --> 05:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
the next question anybody representative
Gallagher

05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
05:39:29.930 --> 05:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned being both a
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
landlord and a parent so
 
05:39:33.840 --> 05:39:34.730 align:start position:0%
landlord and a parent so
um

05:39:34.730 --> 05:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:39.170 --> 05:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
that kind of made me realize so
 
05:39:41.448 --> 05:39:41.458 align:start position:0%
um with the two separate
 
05:39:41.458 --> 05:39:43.190 align:start position:0%
um with the two separate
portions

05:39:43.190 --> 05:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
portions
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
of this bill the one
 
05:39:48.770 --> 05:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
for the parents themselves and then the
 
05:39:50.570 --> 05:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
one for the landlords
 
05:39:52.628 --> 05:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
could you possibly
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
qualify for both of it like what if you
 
05:39:58.190 --> 05:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
just rented to yourself or to your
 
05:40:01.070 --> 05:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
spouse or something or would that let
 
05:40:01.080 --> 05:40:02.030 align:start position:0%
spouse or something or would that let
you

05:40:02.030 --> 05:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:40:05.810 --> 05:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
get both of them or what
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I would I would imagine that
 
05:40:10.610 --> 05:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
that has to do with many many loopholes
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
and trying to you know finagle something
 
05:40:15.288 --> 05:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
that ought not to be finagled I think
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
was the open-endedness of this bill that
 
05:40:19.610 --> 05:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:40:21.650 --> 05:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
um parameter that the municipality can
 
05:40:25.010 --> 05:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
bring up and appropriate for their um
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
for their Community
 
05:40:26.878 --> 05:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
for their Community
um

05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
I guess if it stays as is in every
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
municipality ordered it exactly as the
 
05:40:35.868 --> 05:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
bill is written I guess sure maybe
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but I think even at that as one who
 
05:40:41.208 --> 05:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
has both
 
05:40:41.218 --> 05:40:42.590 align:start position:0%
has both
um

05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:45.288 --> 05:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
I mean to try to rent to my wife I mean
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's that seems pretty illegal in and
 
05:40:49.190 --> 05:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
of itself so
 
05:40:49.200 --> 05:40:51.650 align:start position:0%
of itself so
bro

05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
bro
 
05:40:53.690 --> 05:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh thanks for your
 
05:40:53.700 --> 05:40:55.128 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh thanks for your
testimony

05:40:55.128 --> 05:40:55.138 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:40:57.650 --> 05:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
um so you've already moved here you
 
05:40:58.970 --> 05:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
already have children you already have a
 
05:41:00.530 --> 05:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
house that's great I appreciate you
 
05:41:02.448 --> 05:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire would this bill
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
be an incentive for your friends from
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts someplace else to move
 
05:41:08.930 --> 05:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
here and make the state their home do
 
05:41:12.530 --> 05:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
you think thank you absolutely
 
05:41:14.930 --> 05:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
um per would have per word of mouth I
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
think the one of the biggest questions
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
because I'm actually huge since I moved
 
05:41:20.570 --> 05:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
here I'm like man I could never go back
 
05:41:22.010 --> 05:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm from the inner city so like I can
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
never go back to those places
 
05:41:24.000 --> 05:41:24.770 align:start position:0%
never go back to those places
um

05:41:24.770 --> 05:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
but one of my biggest conversations with
 
05:41:30.590 --> 05:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts homeowners is the tax
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
rates and I think and majority of my
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
friends are around my age starting to
 
05:41:37.490 --> 05:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
have families and stuff like that so
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
personally outside of like the much more
 
05:41:40.080 --> 05:41:41.628 align:start position:0%
personally outside of like the much more
settled

05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
settled
 
05:41:44.208 --> 05:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
um quiet living
 
05:41:45.948 --> 05:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
um like I said the taxes is probably the
 
05:41:47.208 --> 05:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
other biggest thing that the
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
conversation comes up and if there are
 
05:41:51.708 --> 05:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
further and more incentives to actually
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
say hey actually there's these
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
incentives you're having kids now
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
there's actually opportunity for you
 
05:41:59.090 --> 05:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
save back on those taxes I think it's a
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.490 --> 05:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative save us
 
05:42:06.650 --> 05:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts already have a child tax
 
05:42:09.288 --> 05:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
credit that I'm not sure I did not own a
 
05:42:10.490 --> 05:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
home when I was there
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
it does so for those I think there are
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
four seconds
 
05:42:15.180 --> 05:42:16.310 align:start position:0%
four seconds
yeah

05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:22.670 --> 05:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
I guess it's a follow-up I so I guess
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
there are four states right now that
 
05:42:28.368 --> 05:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
offer child tax credits so the question
 
05:42:28.378 --> 05:42:30.410 align:start position:0%
offer child tax credits so the question
is

05:42:30.410 --> 05:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:42:32.530 --> 05:42:32.540 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
people in other states finding New
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attractive because it will
 
05:42:40.610 --> 05:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
join the list
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
of such States or is it attractive for
 
05:42:45.470 --> 05:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
other reasons
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh no I think it's definitely attractive
 
05:42:50.570 --> 05:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
for other reasons but is deterred for
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
other reasons and I think one of the
 
05:42:54.530 --> 05:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
biggest deterrents is the high tax rates
 
05:42:59.090 --> 05:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
so if there are abilities to lessen that
 
05:43:01.250 --> 05:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
deterrent I think it could provide
 
05:43:03.650 --> 05:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
something awesome
 
05:43:03.660 --> 05:43:05.390 align:start position:0%
something awesome
representative

05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:07.850 --> 05:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Angel for
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
coming and participating in the public
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
hearing my question to you is
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations owning the home and
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
moving from Massachusetts
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
but don't you believe or do you believe
 
05:43:26.810 --> 05:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
that your property value
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
the same house you put it across the
 
05:43:29.520 --> 05:43:32.090 align:start position:0%
the same house you put it across the
border

05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
border
 
05:43:35.330 --> 05:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
will be doubled or tripled
 
05:43:39.170 --> 05:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
and so the property tax in that sense
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is the only tax that New Hampshire
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
has so
 
05:43:47.930 --> 05:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
that in itself is an incentive for
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
moving up here you get a property that's
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
in a good
 
05:43:55.368 --> 05:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
for much lower value compared to
 
05:43:59.390 --> 05:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but also this adding this
 
05:44:03.170 --> 05:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
incentive tax credit if there is a
 
05:44:05.770 --> 05:44:05.780 align:start position:0%
public school a vibrant public school
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
education and a community the young
 
05:44:11.570 --> 05:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
families come anyways
 
05:44:15.410 --> 05:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
isn't it so is this an additional thing
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
or would it
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
so if I may clarify the question if I
 
05:44:27.650 --> 05:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
think from what I hear you saying is the
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes in Massachusetts are
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
typically higher because the value of
 
05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
the house is higher so therefore this
 
05:44:37.610 --> 05:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
property the tax credit wouldn't
 
05:44:40.570 --> 05:44:40.580 align:start position:0%
actually be doing anything because
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying the same
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
amount of tax because your house is
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
worth more
 
05:44:44.520 --> 05:44:45.770 align:start position:0%
worth more
okay

05:44:45.770 --> 05:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:45.780 --> 05:44:51.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
it's okay if you don't know the answer
 
05:44:57.170 --> 05:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
you can just say I'm not sure I'm
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
definitely not sure of specific numbers
 
05:45:00.048 --> 05:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
that's for sure I was thinking through
 
05:45:04.010 --> 05:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
though but thank you further questions
 
05:45:06.530 --> 05:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
seeing on uh I want to thank you very
 
05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%

05:45:12.048 --> 05:45:12.058 align:start position:0%

and a landlord all at once that's
 
05:45:16.368 --> 05:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
awesome welcome to New Hampshire uh next
 
05:45:32.090 --> 05:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right still red
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chairman uh Alex
 
05:45:39.170 --> 05:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
Madden from Derry uh speaking in support
 
05:45:41.090 --> 05:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
just come a little closer to the mic
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very good very good uh Alex
 
05:45:46.730 --> 05:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
Madden from Derry speaking in support of
 
05:45:48.350 --> 05:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:45:51.548 --> 05:45:51.558 align:start position:0%
um I also am a young father
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it wanted to uh kind of address the
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
the greater context with within which
 
05:46:00.288 --> 05:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
we're we're addressing this uh and and I
 
05:46:02.930 --> 05:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
will get to the point very quickly but
 
05:46:02.940 --> 05:46:03.708 align:start position:0%
will get to the point very quickly but
um

05:46:03.708 --> 05:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know the literally the entire
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
Western modernized world is is having
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
declining birth rates uh typically below
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh replacement even that's been the case
 
05:46:16.750 --> 05:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the United States uh generally since
 
05:46:21.530 --> 05:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
1971 specifically uh since 2007 uh and
 
05:46:23.448 --> 05:46:23.458 align:start position:0%
and as has already been mentioned today
 
05:46:27.650 --> 05:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire uh is is virtually
 
05:46:31.250 --> 05:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
um the the second uh least in in that
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
category uh so so I think the context is
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
helpful because as the state
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
we are quite literally competing for
 
05:46:42.650 --> 05:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
young people uh young people to provide
 
05:46:44.810 --> 05:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
essential Services uh that that
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
everybody in our community needs this is
 
05:46:49.250 --> 05:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
not just
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
um purely for young people with families
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is uh generally speaking going to
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
be a a benefit uh to the entire
 
05:46:56.760 --> 05:46:58.490 align:start position:0%
be a a benefit uh to the entire
Community

05:46:58.490 --> 05:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
Community
 
05:47:00.650 --> 05:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
um my my journey down this road uh
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
started when I read a book by Peter
 
05:47:06.650 --> 05:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
Francis who was an author he wrote about
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the demographic Trends in New
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he published a second book
 
05:47:14.090 --> 05:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
about it and eventually he left for
 
05:47:14.100 --> 05:47:15.190 align:start position:0%
about it and eventually he left for
Pennsylvania

05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
to be with his family who would not
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
could not come back into the state they
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have the The Economic Opportunity
 
05:47:25.970 --> 05:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
he I asked if I actually got in contact
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
with him asked him if he would give a
 
05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
testimony he was unable to do so due to
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
a tooth infection but nonetheless he he
 
05:47:36.948 --> 05:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
also expressed his uh his excuse me
 
05:47:40.250 --> 05:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.010 --> 05:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
I've I've known three families who have
 
05:47:46.250 --> 05:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
left the state within the last year for
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
for greater
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities in in other states
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I I wouldn't say that a a
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
child tax credit would would uh have
 
05:47:57.948 --> 05:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
single-handedly solved the problem for
 
05:47:59.930 --> 05:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
those specific families but I think it
 
05:48:01.810 --> 05:48:01.820 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the right direction
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and so you know we're
 
05:48:08.090 --> 05:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to incentivize
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
something that you know as a community
 
05:48:12.530 --> 05:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
we want to see more of at least I think
 
05:48:14.510 --> 05:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of us want to see more of it and
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
and so by giving the local
 
05:48:19.368 --> 05:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
municipalities the option but not the
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
requirement each Community can decide
 
05:48:24.288 --> 05:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
05:48:27.470 --> 05:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you I'll take any questions
 
05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do we have
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:36.170 --> 05:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and I would Echo the same
 
05:48:40.970 --> 05:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
things we said for angel thank you for
 
05:48:43.250 --> 05:48:43.260 align:start position:0%

05:48:52.430 --> 05:48:52.440 align:start position:0%

last time for this hearing on hb94 and
 
05:48:58.730 --> 05:48:58.740 align:start position:0%

Association again we don't have a
 
05:49:07.128 --> 05:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
position on this bill just to make sure
 
05:49:10.490 --> 05:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
the committee is aware we did
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
um ask our Board of Directors for some
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
guidance because there are a number of
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
local option tax credits coming uh
 
05:49:18.170 --> 05:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
before this committee and others this
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
year and we were instructed not to have
 
05:49:22.430 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
a position on those but to provide
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
information and um
 
05:49:27.410 --> 05:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
and and any sort of technical issues we
 
05:49:27.420 --> 05:49:28.970 align:start position:0%
and and any sort of technical issues we
identified

05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
identified
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
um so line six uh it one of the
 
05:49:38.090 --> 05:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
line six has the the word percentage we
 
05:49:39.410 --> 05:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
would ask that if the committee
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
considers uh passing this that they
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment to delete the word
 
05:49:46.430 --> 05:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
percentage and the reason for that is we
 
05:49:48.770 --> 05:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
need a fixed dollar amount in order to
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh accurately determine what property
 
05:49:55.910 --> 05:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxes everyone's going to be paying as
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
well as what the appropriate amount is
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
to raise for the municipality
 
05:50:02.030 --> 05:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
percentage just doesn't work because
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna depend on the
 
05:50:05.570 --> 05:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
valuation of each individual's home
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that's gonna that's gonna change
 
05:50:09.048 --> 05:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
over time and it's going to depend on
 
05:50:11.448 --> 05:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
who moves where so we'd essentially be
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
required municipalities to track all the
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
children in town and where they live and
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
what the valuations are and that's not
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
going to work well
 
05:50:24.650 --> 05:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
um line seven we weren't exactly sure if
 
05:50:26.868 --> 05:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
there was supposed to be a
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
um a determination about how long
 
05:50:31.730 --> 05:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
someone resided in town
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
um before they qualified for the the tax
 
05:50:36.650 --> 05:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
credit it sounded like from the
 
05:50:38.570 --> 05:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
introduction that may be left up to the
 
05:50:38.580 --> 05:50:40.128 align:start position:0%
introduction that may be left up to the
municipality

05:50:40.128 --> 05:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
as much as it chagrins me to say this
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's good for
 
05:50:46.490 --> 05:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have some solid
 
05:50:46.500 --> 05:50:48.230 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have some solid
guidelines

05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
05:50:51.770 --> 05:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
um as to when things should be running
 
05:50:51.780 --> 05:50:52.788 align:start position:0%
um as to when things should be running
um

05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
so if that's something the committee is
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to work with you on that
 
05:50:58.680 --> 05:51:00.650 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to work with you on that
and

05:51:00.650 --> 05:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:03.490 --> 05:51:03.500 align:start position:0%
um line 11
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
is relating to the uh persons who rent
 
05:51:09.770 --> 05:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
property and residents who reside on
 
05:51:12.048 --> 05:51:12.058 align:start position:0%
rental property we've seen this in a
 
05:51:13.010 --> 05:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
couple different
 
05:51:13.020 --> 05:51:13.850 align:start position:0%
couple different
um

05:51:13.850 --> 05:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:16.490 --> 05:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
local option tax credits this year we
 
05:51:18.650 --> 05:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
don't currently have a system to refund
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
renters amounts that are paid by the
 
05:51:25.910 --> 05:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
property owners it's our our system is
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
set up for
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
um those who have an interest in the
 
05:51:33.288 --> 05:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
property to receive the refund or you
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
know to receive the credit or the
 
05:51:39.170 --> 05:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
exemption so this would be a new
 
05:51:41.690 --> 05:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
system we're setting up so we want to
 
05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
make you aware of that
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
um there may be questions that arise in
 
05:51:49.010 --> 05:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
response to that as how exactly
 
05:51:52.490 --> 05:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities ought to operate that
 
05:51:55.490 --> 05:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and that leads me to my last Point
 
05:51:57.770 --> 05:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
um which you've heard from Catherine in
 
05:52:00.230 --> 05:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
assessing bills which is there's no
 
05:52:02.810 --> 05:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
fractional interest Clause here so if
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
that was something that was of interest
 
05:52:07.128 --> 05:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
to the municipality
 
05:52:09.288 --> 05:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
um sorry the committee it's been a long
 
05:52:13.250 --> 05:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
day we wanted to raise that so that no
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
clarification Bill had to come back in
 
05:52:17.150 --> 05:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
Future years if this was something you
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
were interested in
 
05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have unless the
 
05:52:21.770 --> 05:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions for me thank
 
05:52:21.780 --> 05:52:23.208 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions for me thank
you

05:52:23.208 --> 05:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
05:52:28.970 --> 05:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative Guthrie
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
05:52:30.718 --> 05:52:32.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for
eign

05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
eign
 
05:52:34.850 --> 05:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I just have a
 
05:52:37.128 --> 05:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
quick question because it's not clear on
 
05:52:38.208 --> 05:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
who if we pass this bill who would set
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
up the parameters
 
05:52:46.570 --> 05:52:46.580 align:start position:0%
or are they already set up in this CRS
 
05:52:50.930 --> 05:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
rsas so it would apparently be part of
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
the local adoption it is different than
 
05:52:57.708 --> 05:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
current systems so for example under the
 
05:52:57.718 --> 05:52:59.030 align:start position:0%
current systems so for example under the
elderly

05:52:59.030 --> 05:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
05:53:01.730 --> 05:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
um tax credit municipalities have the
 
05:53:04.850 --> 05:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
option of giving a certain amount this
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
would appear to allow them to
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
according to what the sponsor or
 
05:53:12.890 --> 05:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor said to Define that a little
 
05:53:15.530 --> 05:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit more granually than
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:24.350 --> 05:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you got just a quick while
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear to me
 
05:53:29.690 --> 05:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
but who's going to do that the response
 
05:53:31.850 --> 05:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
he has once he has the bill it's the
 
05:53:34.610 --> 05:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
bill is ours it's not his who's going to
 
05:53:37.128 --> 05:53:37.138 align:start position:0%
set up the parameters
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
is it this committee or is it
 
05:53:42.350 --> 05:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
municipality once it goes through or if
 
05:53:45.288 --> 05:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
you pass it as is presumably
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
the municipality is part of its warn
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
article could help Define who would
 
05:53:49.558 --> 05:53:50.930 align:start position:0%
article could help Define who would
qualify

05:53:50.930 --> 05:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
05:53:53.810 --> 05:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
but it may be the case that this
 
05:53:53.820 --> 05:53:55.010 align:start position:0%
but it may be the case that this
committee

05:53:55.010 --> 05:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
would like to set up parameters as part
 
05:53:59.570 --> 05:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
of that state law in order to make sure
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that municipalities are dealing what the
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
state policy would be as set by the
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislature I appreciate that thank you
 
05:54:07.850 --> 05:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:54:14.690 --> 05:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if this bill were
 
05:54:17.090 --> 05:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
to become law and immune system and a
 
05:54:19.970 --> 05:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
municipality were to adopt this
 
05:54:22.250 --> 05:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
I would then assume is it is it correct
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
that the municipality would then set up
 
05:54:28.368 --> 05:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
um an application form or system by
 
05:54:31.490 --> 05:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
which a family would apply for this and
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
how is that information verified and
 
05:54:36.650 --> 05:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
again who is going to set up that system
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
and in order to apply and verify the
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
information and and what would that take
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of man hours and administration
 
05:54:47.280 --> 05:54:48.410 align:start position:0%
in terms of man hours and administration
um

05:54:48.410 --> 05:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to provide an
 
05:54:55.070 --> 05:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
estimate of how many man hours
 
05:54:58.010 --> 05:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
Administration obviously any
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
municipality that shows any kind of
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
local option tax credit whether this one
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
or another one would have to administer
 
05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
that local level there would be some
 
05:55:10.128 --> 05:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
sort of administrative cost associated
 
05:55:13.010 --> 05:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
with that presumably run run through the
 
05:55:15.650 --> 05:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
local local assessor or contract
 
05:55:17.690 --> 05:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
assessor depending on who the who the
 
05:55:22.570 --> 05:55:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.128 --> 05:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
05:55:28.610 --> 05:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
Grace for taking my question
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
um if if this bill would have passed in
 
05:55:34.430 --> 05:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
in some form you just said something
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
about fractional interests would I we
 
05:55:39.530 --> 05:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
would I have to go back and amend my
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful Bill 197 to include the
 
05:55:43.970 --> 05:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
language in here or are we running a
 
05:55:46.368 --> 05:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
foul if if that doesn't happen with my
 
05:55:49.730 --> 05:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I would like to keep my answer
 
05:55:54.110 --> 05:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
relevant to this bill uh representative
 
05:55:56.150 --> 05:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's a serious question to yell at me
 
05:55:56.160 --> 05:55:57.230 align:start position:0%
it's a serious question to yell at me
otherwise

05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Nate you are correct we are speaking
 
05:56:01.490 --> 05:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
about this bill and representative
 
05:56:05.208 --> 05:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
majority and uh and so I just mentioned
 
05:56:06.770 --> 05:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
fractional interest because it's
 
05:56:06.780 --> 05:56:07.970 align:start position:0%
fractional interest because it's
possible

05:56:07.970 --> 05:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:56:10.190 --> 05:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
so I guess a scenario I would give you
 
05:56:12.530 --> 05:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
is you have you know two parents they're
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
divorced one lives in the house but
 
05:56:17.330 --> 05:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
they're both their names are on the deed
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
presumably the intent here would be to
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
give the parent who actually has custody
 
05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the child the majority of the the tax
 
05:56:26.760 --> 05:56:28.368 align:start position:0%
of the child the majority of the the tax
credit

05:56:28.368 --> 05:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
um at least that's my assumption and the
 
05:56:32.330 --> 05:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
other one may not live in that property
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what I meant by fractional
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
interest it's also possible you know
 
05:56:37.440 --> 05:56:38.810 align:start position:0%
interest it's also possible you know
like

05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:56:42.048 --> 05:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
you have a multi uh family situation
 
05:56:44.448 --> 05:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
where someone's parents assist them to
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
buy a property and their names are on
 
05:56:47.930 --> 05:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
the deed and Etc so it could get
 
05:56:47.940 --> 05:56:50.150 align:start position:0%
the deed and Etc so it could get
complicated

05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:56:52.490 --> 05:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative freeze
 
05:56:55.010 --> 05:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:56:57.708 --> 05:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question is
 
05:57:00.530 --> 05:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
there a possibility that this would be
 
05:57:04.190 --> 05:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
abused by the landlords
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
by turning over their attendance prefer
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
not to speculate as to what anyone may
 
05:57:14.770 --> 05:57:14.780 align:start position:0%
do with any monies they receive
 
05:57:17.570 --> 05:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Stevens
 
05:57:19.670 --> 05:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Graves for
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:57:24.350 --> 05:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
the previous not the previous but
 
05:57:26.330 --> 05:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
previous to the previous question raised
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
a question in my mind about joint
 
05:57:29.160 --> 05:57:30.410 align:start position:0%
a question in my mind about joint
custody

05:57:30.410 --> 05:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
custody
 
05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
would it be possible under the bill as
 
05:57:36.470 --> 05:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's now written for both parents to
 
05:57:39.048 --> 05:57:39.058 align:start position:0%
claim the tax credit if they had joint
 
05:57:39.058 --> 05:57:41.690 align:start position:0%
claim the tax credit if they had joint
custody

05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that goes back to the
 
05:57:45.410 --> 05:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
definition of of reside
 
05:57:45.420 --> 05:57:46.310 align:start position:0%
definition of of reside
um

05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:46.320 --> 05:57:48.288 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:57:48.288 --> 05:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that definition is I
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
know the election law committee has been
 
05:57:54.350 --> 05:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
struggling with that for years and I
 
05:57:55.730 --> 05:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
would prefer not to get involved in that
 
05:57:55.740 --> 05:57:58.010 align:start position:0%
would prefer not to get involved in that
debate

05:57:58.010 --> 05:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
debate
 
05:58:00.470 --> 05:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
very good answer representative
 
05:58:00.480 --> 05:58:02.090 align:start position:0%
very good answer representative
mangaputi

05:58:02.090 --> 05:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
mangaputi
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Grace uh
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I will try
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.670 --> 05:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
with this tax credit going to the
 
05:58:19.250 --> 05:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
landlords it's great when a young family
 
05:58:21.650 --> 05:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
with children are the landlords and it
 
05:58:22.850 --> 05:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
helps them
 
05:58:25.788 --> 05:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
if the young family is the renter with
 
05:58:29.208 --> 05:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
Children what guarantee is there that
 
05:58:33.530 --> 05:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
the renter the landlord pass on the
 
05:58:33.540 --> 05:58:34.730 align:start position:0%
the renter the landlord pass on the
savings

05:58:34.730 --> 05:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
savings
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the landlord from keeping
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:45.170 --> 05:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
so I think you raise an important point
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
to the committee for the committee to
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
consider which is
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
if it desires to pass this and create a
 
05:58:53.330 --> 05:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
system whereby someone who's renting a
 
05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
property could qualify for the credit
 
05:58:58.430 --> 05:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
there probably needs to be Clarity on
 
05:59:01.310 --> 05:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
line 11 for exactly how a municipality
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
is to administer that whether they're
 
05:59:05.208 --> 05:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
supposed to give preference to the
 
05:59:06.590 --> 05:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
renter or whether they give it to the
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
landlord who can claim it and how that
 
05:59:11.570 --> 05:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
process works otherwise we may end up in
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:19.970 --> 05:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:22.788 --> 05:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
and with that thank you
 
05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's the end of our hearing on the blue
 
05:59:28.010 --> 05:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
sheet we have one two three four five
 
05:59:32.270 --> 05:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
for the bill and we have one against
 
05:59:34.010 --> 05:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the hearing on
 
05:59:34.020 --> 05:59:38.330 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the hearing on
hb294

05:59:38.330 --> 05:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
so next week for our committee we will
 
05:59:44.810 --> 05:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
be meeting back here Wednesday at 10 A.M
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
I believe we have eight or nine more
 
05:59:50.208 --> 05:59:50.218 align:start position:0%
bills uh that we will go through on
 
05:59:53.090 --> 05:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
hearings the following day we have a
 
05:59:54.830 --> 05:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
house session I think most of you know
 
05:59:54.840 --> 05:59:56.448 align:start position:0%
house session I think most of you know
that

05:59:56.448 --> 05:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
um after next Wednesday we are really
 
06:00:02.570 --> 06:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
doing well we will only have I think six
 
06:00:05.090 --> 06:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
or seven bills to go so we are well
 
06:00:07.730 --> 06:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
ahead of schedule we're doing well
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
um the following week after
 
06:00:13.610 --> 06:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
the house session next week we will be
 
06:00:16.010 --> 06:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
obviously uh probably meeting twice
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
again we'll have a day of exacting and
 
06:00:23.208 --> 06:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
probably take up our our final bills
 
06:00:26.208 --> 06:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
um a couple Mr chairman
 
06:00:30.288 --> 06:00:30.298 align:start position:0%
yes representative will we be executing
 
06:00:33.890 --> 06:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
the bills that we heard a week ago
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
next week
 
06:00:39.048 --> 06:00:39.058 align:start position:0%
um as of right now there are no bills
 
06:00:42.310 --> 06:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be exact but there will be
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
some that we will exec in two weeks I
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly which ones right
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
now I haven't okay okay looked at them
 
06:00:53.930 --> 06:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:55.548 --> 06:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I briefly mentioned
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
it during our hearing if we could please
 
06:01:02.270 --> 06:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
um when we have questions for the for
 
06:01:05.330 --> 06:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
the individual testifying if we could
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
have him concise and to the point and be
 
06:01:12.288 --> 06:01:12.298 align:start position:0%
truly questions rather than a long
 
06:01:14.930 --> 06:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
lead-in of statement that would be very
 
06:01:16.690 --> 06:01:16.700 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
06:01:19.010 --> 06:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
also the other thing that I wrote down
 
06:01:22.730 --> 06:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
was about follow-ons follow-ons are
 
06:01:25.368 --> 06:01:25.378 align:start position:0%
meant to be that follow-up follow-ups on
 
06:01:27.470 --> 06:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
your initial question which the question
 
06:01:29.448 --> 06:01:29.458 align:start position:0%
initial question should be to the
 
06:01:31.730 --> 06:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
individual's testimony so let's make
 
06:01:31.740 --> 06:01:32.708 align:start position:0%
individual's testimony so let's make
sure

06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:01:35.330 --> 06:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
the follow-on is actually a follow-on
 
06:01:36.830 --> 06:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
and here's the reason what I like to do
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you've noticed but I go
 
06:01:40.670 --> 06:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
from side to side all right I want a
 
06:01:44.448 --> 06:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
Democrat a Democrat Republican I try to
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
be as good as I can on that
 
06:01:49.970 --> 06:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
I I don't want certain individuals
 
06:01:51.890 --> 06:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
monopolizing the time because I also
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
want everybody involved with the
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
questioning okay so if you can keep your
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
true follow-ups to a follow-up on a
 
06:02:01.250 --> 06:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
question you ask that's great otherwise
 
06:02:02.930 --> 06:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
I will go to the next individual and
 
06:02:04.730 --> 06:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
then once everybody's had a chance to
 
06:02:04.740 --> 06:02:05.570 align:start position:0%
then once everybody's had a chance to
speak

06:02:05.570 --> 06:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
speak
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
then I will go back to the original
 
06:02:09.288 --> 06:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
person who wants to ask an additional
 
06:02:09.298 --> 06:02:11.270 align:start position:0%
person who wants to ask an additional
question

06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
was I clear
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
I see some furred eyebrows coming from
 
06:02:18.410 --> 06:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
no good
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
well it looked like you were kind of
 
06:02:22.548 --> 06:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
squinting okay
 
06:02:24.250 --> 06:02:24.260 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions
