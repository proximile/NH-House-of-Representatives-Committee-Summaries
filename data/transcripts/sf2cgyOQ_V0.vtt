Other Drug checking
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
equipment uh I'd like to start off by
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
thanking everyone who's involved
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Muse I know
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative nle
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh definitely put a lot into this again
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
as as I testified or spoke the last time
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
about this I think it's it's a really
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
good Bild to have however there's so
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
many back doors where the nefarious the
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
drug dealers and traffickers are going
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
to use this as a defense any defense
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to look at this bill
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
as is and use it for their behalf uh I
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
sat through for a week when I got the
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment and really looked at it
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
thoroughly and the only way that I feel
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
that this can go through
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
is to completely gut the bill and change
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
the wordage to prevent those unsavory
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
characters from using this as their
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
defense uh we do have the Fentanyl and
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
xylazine Bill that did go through which
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
is great I just think again as is that
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
there's too many loopholes where at its
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
face that wasn't the intent of the bill
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it is going to be used uh
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
for those nefarious
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
characters um we can vote on it today
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll hear some more testimony
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's probably going to go 33 and
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it goes again I just
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
really wish that this could be chopped
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
so much that we don't allow them to to
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
use the back door and this isn't a back
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
door this is back doors multiple doors
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
where they're going to sneak in uh
 
00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.789 align:start position:0%
where they're going to sneak in uh
representative

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
selig thank you I I know that last time
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
we struggled with whether or not to meet
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad that we were able to have
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation then and you know I
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
didn't come in today with my mind made
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
up I came in today knowing we needed to
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
have the conversation and I hope that we
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
can all be here with that same energy
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
but I also was thinking as I drove over
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
here about the title of our committee
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
which is criminal justice which is how
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
we mostly refer to ourselves but there's
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
a significant other part of it which is
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety and so I'm I'm hopeful
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
that we can be looking at this bill not
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
just Through The Eyes of criminal
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
justice but really also um and probably
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
more so with the eyes of Public Safety
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and I I know that um
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Muse has been working on
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
some amendments to try to help make the
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
language and the structure of the bill
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
more palatable and uh narrow the focus
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that it's not used by as as the term
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
you used I think was nefarious
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
characters which makes me think of the
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
minions but um you know sorry I'm a
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
parent um but I I just would say as we
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
move through today I really hope we can
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
be looking at all of this through the
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
focus of of public Public Safety and and
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
again as I said last time the goal is
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
one more day so that hopefully people
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
can recognize that that's the day they
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
should try to get into
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
recovery thank you representative Reed
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
from this um Community member for out of
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh Jesus Lopez and he is an a
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
um former
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
um drug dealer um he came from the Bronx
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
settled in Manchester and he said that
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
um new and this is um this plays into
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
public safety he said that uh New
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people come to New Hampshire
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
because our drug our laws are so LAX um
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that he can get so much he could in
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
the past get so much more money for his
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
drugs in New Hampshire that we actually
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
attract um drugs and and and um dealers
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
enables um addicts um and I have to
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
respect him because he's lived this this
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%

safe and if he doesn't feel this is a
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
Muse I think one of the things that we
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
we try to avoid on this committee is
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislating by anecdote um personal
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
stories are are powerful uh in the
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
context of the bail bills in the context
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
of this bill um we've heard some pretty
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
powerful stories along the way um one of
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
the things we also have our some pretty
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
powerful updated statistics so in nashaa
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and Manchester so far this year American
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
Medical Response which is uh an
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
ambulance service has recorded uh has
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
responded to over 700 uh
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
overdoses and uh unfortunately quite a
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
few of those overdoses uh have been
 
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.070 align:start position:0%
few of those overdoses uh have been
fatal

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
fatal
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
overdoses and when asked to comment on
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know why we're still seeing uh these
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
high fatal overdose rates the regional
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
director of American response uh Medical
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
Response said people who are using
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
illicit substances have no idea what
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
they are using contain synthetic
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or how potent synthetic
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in the product is the people
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
who use these drugs are not necessarily
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
all drug dealers from the
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
Bronx um a lot of them are high school
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
kids they're college kids there are kids
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
there are parents there are husbands our
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
wives our daughters our
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
sons um and I think one of the things
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to to keep in mind um is
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
that the main objective of of this bill
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and also some of the proposals that
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
we've had to amend it what we're really
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do here are save lives I mean
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that's basically what it comes down
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
to um we not only have an overdose
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire we have an
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
overdose fatality problem and there are
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
things that that we can do from a law
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective that can help
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
um catching more drug dealers and
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
putting them in jail is a is a good
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
thing but I think one of the things that
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
we've learned over the past few years is
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we can do that we can support our
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
police in their efforts to do that um
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
and we should support our police and
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
their effort efforts to do that but I
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
think the other thing that we need to
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
look at is and we need to recognize is
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
that this issue is not just a criminal
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
justice problem it's also a public
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
health problem and and as a public
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
health problem one of the things that
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
you do is you look at things issues like
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
this through a slightly different lens
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
in in criminal justice we like to talk
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
about being able to prevent things uh
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
and changing the law you know to to
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
prevent people or disincentivize people
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
from from doing certain things in the
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
public health world one of the things
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we talk about is trying to actually
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of bad things happening
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think we realize that nothing we do on
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
this committee no law we can pass is
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to ensure that people don't
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
continue to overdose on Fentanyl and
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
that some people won't continue to die
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
in from fentanyl but there are steps
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
that we can take by changing our law
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
that can help
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that fewer people are dying and
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
and and again we're not just talking
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
about drun drug leaders from the Bronx
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
or people from LOL and Lawrence the
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
people who are dying are people's Sons
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
daughters husbands wives um and this is
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
just something we have the power to do
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
that we have the power to act on um we
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a good bill in front of us uh that
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
would make it possible for more people
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh to check their drugs to
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that they don't contain
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
illicit substances or contain substances
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
that they don't even didn't even know
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
they were taking which is one of the
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
biggest problems with
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
fentanyl um and and I think that while
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
we made well we took an important step
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of legalizing uh f and
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips uh if we really
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
want to achieve results in this area and
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
if we're really serious about reducing
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
the death rate
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
then this is the kind of Bill that we
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to pass and and and and I would
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
like to try to find a way we can come
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
together on
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you excuse me just
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
real briefly and then uh represent and
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
pro uh looking through the law
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement lens which I was a state
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
police state trooper for for two decades
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
these bills criminals do not care about
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
otherwise they wouldn't be committing
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
crimes uh and I do appreciate yes we do
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
need to reduce these these deaths but
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
the the criminals do not care and what
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
this is doing is while we're now helping
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
the person who's addicted to test their
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
drugs we are now giving the criminal the
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
back door to use a defense to get them
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
back onto the streets to continue to
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
sell drugs that's why we really need to
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
chop this down if it goes forward uh and
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
again I do like it at its face but I'm
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
looking in my lens as law en and they
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
will use this for their defense and they
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
won't be locked up they'll get back onto
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
the streets and continue and continue
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
while more of the those who are addicted
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
are going to continue
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
to be addicted representative
 
00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.630 align:start position:0%
to be addicted representative
Pro

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
so I work on the street as an
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
EMT I can't tell you how much Naran I've
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
given but I'm pretty
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
sure none of these people take the time
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
to test their drug drugs they get them
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
they take them and off they go and
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
that's uh I think has to do with them
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
overdosing is that they don't even
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
measure correctly or understand that if
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
they went from their old dealer to a ne
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
new dealer it's probably changed a
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
little bit and they should be cautious
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
they don't care they're just going to
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
take the same amount to get that high
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
and that's all they care about they're
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
not going to take out their little test
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
kit and say oh I got to test this see if
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
this F on there and frankly I I think
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
they might even like the fenil because
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
it gives them a better high and they're
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
you know playing craps with that is it
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to get me just higher or is it
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
going to push me over and hopefully if I
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
go over my friend has Naran in his
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
pocket and they'll take care of me but I
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see this as the answer the
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
written thank you
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.070 align:start position:0%
written thank you
represent

00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at a 50st state survey
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the legality of drug checking
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
equipment in the United States and while
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
I can understand um that there might be
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
um that there could be some remote
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of someone using it as a
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
defense I'm really curious what this
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
information doesn't tell me and I'd love
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
to know is if when they passed uh
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
legalization of drug drug checking
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
equipment um defenses using this law
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
were used because I feel like we'd hear
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
about that I think that would be
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
something that um you know that people
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be up in arms about and and
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
rightly so if that were the case and I
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
just keep coming back to the the very
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
small amount that it is when we say
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
nominal nominal nominal when we say
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
nominal um and we're trying to make sure
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we restrict that as much as
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
possible I think you know the reason
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing that is so that we can allow
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the benefit in this one way and
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
protect against the potential for harm
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
um in in in another way so um I think
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's really what we've been trying to
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
do here is weigh the you know the
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
benefits and the potential for the
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
potential risks but also I mean just at
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I feel like we have
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
so much information to back up how this
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
is important and how this can be helpful
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
and so little evidence to the contrary
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
like that that the risks that people are
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
using it in cases and and I think you
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
know we as a body have a responsibility
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
to to look at the evidence as it as it
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
exists and and and not necessarily make
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
a decision based on um you know the the
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
worst possible well maybe somebody could
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
do this or whatever especially if we're
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
not seeing that happen you know so I can
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand the the concern about it but
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
some sometimes concerns don't really pan
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
out and I feel like what we've been
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do is trying to make it as
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
specific as possible so that we reduce
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
that risk while maintaining the
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
potential benefits for it
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Reed the
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative Muse the represent of
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
celik thank you Mr chairman um substance
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
abuse Mis uh misuse disorders
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
progressively fatal very resistant to
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
treatment um generally people who are uh
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
have struggle with opioids um many of
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
them don't uh survive their addiction um
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
by making it
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
um I for a lack of a better word easier
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
I think that you know a a tough disease
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
needs needs to be dealt with on a
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
serious level I would like to see
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
statistics showing that how many lives
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
are saved due to testing you know I mean
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to see statistics and I'm
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
sure there's there are none out there
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
that um could support
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh life-saving life lives saved from
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
having available test drug testing
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
equipment that um would make me more
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
you so back in February and March when
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
we were considering this bill um we
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually did hear a testimony from law
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement from uh State Police also
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
from the uh the chiefs of Police
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
Association and they expressed some of
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns that representative tenar
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh expressed as well so in response to
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we did was
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
we did draft an amendment uh that we
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
were going to talk about uh during our
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
executive session but we decided given
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that the fentanyl test strips
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
Bill had had passed uh we decided to uh
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill so we never were
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
able to propose the amendment one of the
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
things that I've handed out to members
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee is uh uh essentially a
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
marked up copy of the original Bill uh
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
with the amendment text uh included in
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
there and the amendment text uh uh
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
addresses things like some of the
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
concerns around uh uh packaging uh and
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
repackaging and making it clear that
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
these things that you know we're talking
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
about it in the context of drug checking
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
only not in the terms of not in terms of
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturing or Distributing uh
 
00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:27.589 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturing or Distributing uh
these

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
chemicals um we added uh language uh
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
defining uh a nominal amount uh because
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
frankly you have to have some level of
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh of these illicit drugs available to
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually be able to uh to do any type of
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
a test uh the uh I I think one of the
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
other things that we also need to pay
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
attention to are some things that have
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
sort of flown under the radar a little
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
bit um so one of the things that's uh
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
been going on in this field is uh there
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
have been some companies that have been
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh developing uh potentially more
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
effective versions of
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
nxone uh and because our control Drug
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
Act only specificly names Noone there
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
could be a potential issue with being
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
able to use some of these new and
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
improved agents to actually help people
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
who are um you know who actually do
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
overdose so there are some things like
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
that that are that are baked into the
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment as well we also would have to
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
do things like change uh the effective
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
date which I think is now June uh June
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh 2023 so he can't go back in time so
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
we need to go forward in time one thing
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
that I I would just suggest to we we
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
have uh Lauren McGinley here who uh
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
testified uh originally in favor of the
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh who can answer just specific
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
questions that we may have around the
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
amendment of uh actually a lot of the
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions for uh for the amendment
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
text uh came from Miss McGinley uh and
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh and from Carrie nry who also works
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the harm reduction field here in New
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so it'd be great to hear
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
from them uh at uh at whatever Point uh
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
the chair feels it would be appropriate
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Cel thank
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
you I definitely agree with with
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and just I remember
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
last week when we were leaving um my
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
recollection is that you had talked
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
about amend we had been working from an
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Muse had
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
prepared last year that we hadn't used
 
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:49.589 align:start position:0%
prepared last year that we hadn't used
um

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
2023-the and I just wasn't sure if that
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
had been if that had happened or if that
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
you'd made a different decision and just
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
if I could understand where we got from
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
the end of our last meeting where there
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
was going to be a potential amendment
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
that we could work through
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
to we don't want to move forward at all
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just trying to to make the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
two things make sense in my head thank
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
you yes we had that kind of Quasi
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
agreement to look at this to change the
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
language but as I sat down and read the
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
full Bill and this was literally a week
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
of me like going back to it I was like a
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
madman if you will trying to figure out
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
how can we make this work uh based upon
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Newman had kind
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
of suggested to the committee and the
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
more I looked at it the more I thought
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
that the the back doors were opening
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
more and more and more and I wanted us
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
to talk further about it because I would
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
and in my law enforcement background and
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh through my degrees with criminal
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
justice and law looking at this it would
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
have had to been completely slash so I
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
did kind of make that almost 180ish uh
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
drug checking which is what we're
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
talking about today I was able to go in
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
and with witness um how those programs
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
operate with such a uh in my head up
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
until seeing it it was a very scientific
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
process because we kept using the word
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
math spectrometer so I couldn't really
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
understand how it was delivered at a
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
community level street level um but it
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
was really wonderful to see the flow of
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
people coming in and engaging and
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing this service so I'd be happy
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
up thank you I just I have one question
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
I know you're there brief did you see
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
the same people over and over again or
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
is there any way to track was this
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
program actually helping them um so I
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
did not see them but our the chemist
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
that uh was doing the testing at two of
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
the sites he um greeted people said
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
hello to them seemed to know them so it
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
seemed to be something that they
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
utilized often um I know that one person
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
in a Lawrence program had been coming in
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
for about 5 years years um and had been
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
really excited when they started to have
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
this because he wanted to be able to
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
communicate out to his friends in his
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
own Community what was happening with
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply um he said he had been
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
doing this for a long time and um had
 
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.470 align:start position:0%
doing this for a long time and um had
not

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
seen such an impact that the the current
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
drug Supply had been making I'm trying
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
to keep all the swears out of what he
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
said um so yeah so he had seen he he had
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
he had not seen such negative impact
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the drug Supply as he had seen in
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
the last five
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
years thank you representative
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
n thank you um I just wanted to kind of
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
make sure emphasize a certain part of
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
what you said and a lot of what we're
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is you know like I
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
was just saying the the um potential
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
risks and the benefits right and I think
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot in the benefits that
 
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.550 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot in the benefits that
isn't

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily um that that is a little
 
00:41:56.839 --> 00:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
necessarily um that that is a little
more

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh obscure right that kind of goes under
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
the Wayside and one of the things that
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and one of the things that
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
I've read a lot about when we're talking
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
about um testing centers and things like
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that is the ability at that point to
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
engage with folks right to build
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
relationships with people to build trust
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
which you know so I I'll let you take it
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
from there I just wonder if you could
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
focus a little bit on that because I
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
feel like that's something that we don't
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily recognize as one of the
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
potential benefits with it and how that
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
contributes to the overall um you know
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
IDE a of of um increasing people's um
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
chances of of successful recovery yeah
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean I just a little tiny bit
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
of History prior to this I worked in
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
direct case management with individuals
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
um with substance use disorder primarily
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
parenting um mothers parenting or
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
pregnant mothers um I had no knowledge
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction um with the exception
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
of what my public health education had
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
taught me so a very surface level um
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
being in a very traditional case
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
management setting I had my binder full
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
of protocol and and how you know when
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
somebody said this this is what I did
 
00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:05.079 align:start position:0%
when somebody said this this is what I
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
did and when they tested positive for a
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
drug in their system I was no longer
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
able or allowed to work with them I had
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
to exit them from my programming um the
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
burnout that happens in those situations
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
is very extreme when you feel like uh a
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
positive drug test means that I can no
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
longer I no longer have tools to help
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
that individual so when I moved into
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
harm reduction I was really really Blown
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
Away by the agency that we give back to
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
the people that we work with in all of
 
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.510 align:start position:0%
the people that we work with in all of
those

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
situations when someone comes to me and
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
asks for sterile syringes and a safe
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
injection kit the agency that is given
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
back to them to be able to say I am
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
identifying to you the things that I
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
need and I'm able to provide them to
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
them a whole new level of communication
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
has opened up between me and the the
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
person that I am serving because I don't
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
have to stop the conversation it's not a
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
question that I need to get past with
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
them are you using drugs or not so
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
really it leaves all of this space and
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
room for deeper more authentic
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
conversations to be happening around how
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
to keep them safe if they are using
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
drugs and that's where I think you're
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
correct the Nuance is there um I I will
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
say from my own experience in the past
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
three years um fentanyl test strips and
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips are utilized every
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
single day by people who use drugs um I
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
will tell you that the most positive
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
population to utilize fentanyl test
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
strips and xylazine test strips are
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
college age children College age young
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
adults I probably shouldn't call them
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
children um because that is a population
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
who has decided they are going to use a
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
very specific drug and they are no
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
longer interested in using any other
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
drug that might be contaminating that
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
one drug for instance cocaine is a
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
recreational drug commonly found on
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
college campuses if a a young adult has
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
decided that they are going to use
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
cocaine they are no longer interested in
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
utilizing that when it tests positive
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
for fentanyl or xylazine so that's a
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
population where I think people are
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
seeing the exact desired results of
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and xylazine test
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
strips that's the kind of the extreme
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
reaction to utilizing them but I will
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
say in a year we have distributed by
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
request over 80 ,000 fentanyl test
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
strips in our um programming so I hope
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
they're being utilized because they're
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
very expensive and and people are asking
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
quite loudly for them so um we we hear
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
from people across the the the age
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
spectrum that they are utilizing the the
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test stps with every new batch
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
that they are purchasing um because we
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't currently have the supply
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
available for people to use them every
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
single time they use a drug but with
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
each new B match their testing and now
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
we have a a whole team of participants
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are really engaged in not only
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
utilizing the xylazine test strips but
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
in helping the companies that make them
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
make them better because there are some
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
smaller flaws with the xylazine test
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
strips um and so you know again it's
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's returning that agency back to a
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
population where previously I had
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
removed their agency many times um and
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that engagement has really led to
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
safety thank you representative Reed
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it it's very
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
promising to hear the success you're
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
having for sure um I just it seems how
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
would changing our current statue change
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
your success I mean it seems like it's
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
working why would we have to change
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
something that's not broken sure thank
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
you it's a great question because um I
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
look at this as like we are uh
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
um we're working with a picture of our
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
drug Supply and when we passed when we
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
successfully passed Fentanyl and xine
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
test strip legality our picture became
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
slightly clearer not clear at all we
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
still can't see it it's still a major
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
blind spot in public health but we're
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
starting to clear up that picture a
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
little bit what we would like to do from
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
a public health perspective is be able
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
to have a consistent and dynamic
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
constantly changing picture of what the
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
current drug Supply looks like because
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is um uniquely situated
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
between some large um entry corridors of
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
substances coming in Boston has large
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
ports Canadian border is not far away um
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have a clear picture of
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
what's currently happening with our drug
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
Supply in New Hampshire therefore our
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
reactions like fentanyl test strips
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips or nxone are only
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
as good as the things that we have
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
already identified existing within our
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
supply my concern is that
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
fentanyl was fentanyl was a GameChanger
 
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.950 align:start position:0%
fentanyl was fentanyl was a GameChanger
in

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
preventing um overdose deaths that was
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
that that changed the game for all of us
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
work we could have
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
seen the need for increased or different
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
strategies around overdose prevention if
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
we had acknowledged or known that
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl had been in the supply in the
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
the um in the quantities that it was
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
starting to appear in not only
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
quantities but in the drugs that it was
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
starting to appear in that that was
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
really where we kind of tripped up was
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
fentanyl started appearing in Supply
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
that we didn't know fentanyl was going
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
to be in so my concern is what will be
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
our next Fentanyl and we're going to
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
have to lean very very heavily on
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
programs that are in Massachusetts
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
programs that are in Rhode Island
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
programs that are nearby but are not
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
exact replicas of what New Hampshire's
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
drug Supply looks like in the way that
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
we approach our next xylazine or our
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
next fentanyl we will always be behind
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
the times because we can only start to
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
react to it once we know it's in the
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
supply thank you followup thank you so
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
um we already people are allowed to use
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
xylazine and Fentanyl test strips you I
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
heard you say you have access to a
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
spectrometer with a chemist no no sorry
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't um the programs um within some
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
of yeah so there is there is um testing
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
available currently to test random
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
samples of street that drugs that are on
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
the street currently for whatever is new
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
and novel in the drug Supply no not in
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in Massachusetts
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has um comprehensive drug
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
checking so that's where I went okay so
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have um spectrometers um
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that fall under your licensing
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
your health agency licensing umbrella no
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
it does not currently so it doesn't
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
protect my staff um or myself from
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
having these machines or being able to
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
do this testing in partnership with our
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
participants the people that we serve
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
and is there any Les um is there any
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
communication with the state toxicology
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
lab sure um is our samples sent there
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
for um testing to see what's on the
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
market on the street thank you sure yeah
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
so uh we've had a long conversation with
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state public health labs they do
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
have some of the Machinery that you
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
would need but to be very I will give a
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
very quick overview these machines are
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
called ftir machines ftirs are loaded
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
with a brain so you can buy a brain
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's relative to Art you can buy a
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
brain that's relative to algae we would
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
need to purchase a brain relative to
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
drugs and Drug
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants um so right now it doesn't
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
have the brain that I think that we the
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
most comprehensive brain that we would
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
need it to have also receiving the
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
samples is where the legality issue
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
comes in um so a small tiny amount of
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
substance in fact I've purchased little
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
Scoops if anybody would like to see the
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
um size that you would need to to create
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
a successful or to to run a successful
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
test um to receive those is where we're
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
running into our legality issues our
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
participants aren't able to come to us
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
with the um half a grain of rice of
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
Supply that they would would need to um
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
have a test done and currently the
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
methodology for how the state public
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
health lab is acquiring samples to chest
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
our drug Supply is incredibly backlogged
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
and is not coming from Supply channels
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
indicate current drug Supply um and I
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
can explain a little bit more if people
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
want to know why it's not current drug
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
Supply I'm seeing that okay so so
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
currently right now we have a dropped
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
powder um policy in the state so if a
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
dropped powder is found at the scene of
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
a crime not relating to substance or
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking dealing um then that
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
dropped powder would be able to enter
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
into state public health um
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
lab um pool for testing but that doesn't
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
mean that the drop powder like the day
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
somebody picks it up off the ground and
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
then enters it into the state public
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
health lab that that's when it would be
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
tested they actually have a very very
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
long list of things that are going to
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
need to go through this ftir or mass
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
speec machine um to to so there's a a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
serious backlog additionally that's not
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
indicative of what our current drug
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
Supply is because these drugs can't be
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
utilized from any scene where known
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
substance use was happening an overdose
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
occurred anything like that um so why
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
that powder was sitting at the team the
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
the scene who it came from why it was
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
there and and when it had most recently
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
been used or even purchased is
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
completely unknown so again it's another
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
picture that is very very blurry it is
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
giving us some idea of what could be
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
coming in and out of New Hampshire what
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
could exist or had existed but it's not
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
um well curated data and it's definitely
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
not well-shared data we have a great
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state public
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
health lab but even they know the
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
limitations of this dropped powder
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appr so why
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
does it have to be drop powder and not
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
something found at a scene or
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
active yeah I completely agree I think
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest missing um pieces of
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
data would be substances found at the
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
scene of a fatal overdose I would love
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
to see our state enter into um an
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
agreement to begin testing um that um
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
I think that dropped powder would be the
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
one that probably avoids I would need
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
you know um we have legal Consultants
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
here but um I would assume drop powder
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
probably uh prevents any of the evidence
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
from being contaminated by testing or
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
being removed from the scene
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
specifically for testing so because that
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
drop powder was not evidence none of the
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
crimes are related to it I would assume
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like it can just be
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
I just know again based on my my
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
experience it seems like there's two
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
different Labs there's the State Health
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
lab and then there's the crime lab state
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
police crime lab so they're they're
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably not talking to each other and
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
there's what you're talking about the
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
drop Potter would never go probably to
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
the state police crime lab it would be
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
me as a trooper stopping a car whatever
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I find drugs that then goes to the
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
the state police crime lab uh sure yeah
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
and you're you are correct I actually
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any interaction with the um
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
police crime labs and um the again the
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
dispersement of information from them is
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
not coming into the public health
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
programs that respond to drug related
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
harms representa
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
Muse so so one of the things that that
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
actually might be helpful I know in the
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
beginning with the fentanyl test strips
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill um uh it it was narrowed down just
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
to fentanyl test strips but it was
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
actually expanded uh uh later on so that
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
xylazine was added
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the things you said that's
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
really interesting is is I think a lot
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
of folks tend to focus on harm reduction
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
as basically being something that can
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
benefit an an individual drug user but
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh if you actually take
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
all of this information and put it
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
together um especially in a way that's
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's more immediate than what some of
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
the other drug testing Labs can provide
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
it can actually provide a picture of of
 
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.549 align:start position:0%
it can actually provide a picture of of
where

00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants um and bad pills so for
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
instance pills that people think are
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
Oxycodone that are actually fentanyl it
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
can provide a picture of where where are
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
they entering you know the the
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace are there parts of the State
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
uh that are more affected uh than other
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
parts of the state you know what what's
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
the overall picture you know in terms of
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
the penetration of a contaminant like
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
xylazine so
 
00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things I that I find
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
interesting is we're we're not just
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're not getting that information just
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
by handing people out fentanyl test
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
strips um and I and I think one of the
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to point out to to my
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
colleagues is that um you know to be
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
honest my bill 470 the one that we're
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
considering today basically started out
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
as an attempt to do what representative
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
nesville did um my goal was just to
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
legalize fent test strips because I
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was kind of crazy that we
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
didn't have a tool like that that was
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
legally available for people um and uh
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
fortunately I had uh several
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
conversations uh with Miss McGinley and
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
Miss no who who basically explained to
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
me that there's there's an opportunity
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
here uh to actually impact far more
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
people in a in a positive way and one of
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
the things that I would say is that if
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
we if we put this bill side if we if we
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
don't do anything with it there are some
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
things in here you know for example one
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
of the things that we do in the in the
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill is we actually Define drug checking
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the context of our uh of our control
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
Drug Act so we actually make it part of
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
that so so so one of the things that we
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
actually did with representative newes
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
bill is we managed to actually legalize
 
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
Fen fentanyl test strips without saying
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
that drug checking is necess you know is
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
is legal and is an activity that we
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
should be pursuing from a policy
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
perspective so there are some I I think
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of good things uh
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill um there may be some ways
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that we can tighten it up in you
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
know in ways that uh I I would hope
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable to the law
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community because I think
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
they're just as interested is anybody in
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
this room when it comes to minimizing um
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know fatalities from overdose
 
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
but I I would just hate to see um an
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually address part of this crisis in
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
a meaningful way go by the boards for at
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
least another year um
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
while we're still in the middle of an
 
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
while we're still in the middle of an
opioid

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
crisis so I I'm just kind of hoping that
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
we can uh we can find a way to come
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
together on
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
this thank you repres representative C
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
giv it a question from Miss McGinley yes
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay and is it all right if I ask a
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
series of questions that sort of they
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
build on each other yes okay thank you
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much um so my
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
first question is do you know about what
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
year it was that fentanyl first was
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
introduced into New
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I don't um I don't because
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can't trust our drug Supply so right
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm unable if if you had a guess would
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
you say five years ago 10 years 15 years
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
no um I 15
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
Ma and then maybe more okay so it's 10
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
to Sure 10 to 15 I don't know I'm so
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
sorry no that's okay so so again if
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
there had
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
been broader-based ruling allowing for
 
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.470 align:start position:0%
been broader-based ruling allowing for
drug

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
testing 10 years ago we might have maybe
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
been able to identify fenol entering our
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
drug Supply then to take action against
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
it is that correct uh yes and if I could
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
add really quick quickly a a great
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
example of this is actually xylazine um
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
xylazine has been in the drug supply for
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
an unknown period of time but
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has probably been costing
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals um and insurance entities a
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money before it
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
was ever even identified why people were
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
developing such terribly infected and
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
hardt treat wounds so that is a great
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
example of um we did not know what was
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
happening even our population of people
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
who use drugs did not know what was
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
happening um but had been seen multiple
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
times for severely infected wounds um
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
which could have easily if we had known
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
was in the supply been linked to
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
xylazine which is what xylazine causes
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
in humans and so
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
just thinking about that so we now have
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to test for those two
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
specific substances yes only within our
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
drug yes
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
um um if you had to guess and I
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
recognize this is pure
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
speculation of what of um a number of
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
other substances being introduced into
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
our narcotic Supply and I'm not
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting we should be encouraging
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
narcotic Supply I want to be very clear
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
about that but if if you had to guess
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
how many things do you think could be in
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
our current narcotic Supply that we
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
don't know are there because we can't
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
test it sure um so for concerning
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
substances in the current drug Supply
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
the two that kind of rattle around in my
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
head as our next big con tenders um one
 
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing problem but I think is
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to increase substantially is benzo
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
diazines being entered into the heroin
 
01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.789 align:start position:0%
diazines being entered into the heroin
Supply

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
um benzodiazapines um is a withdrawal
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
that somebody can die from um so even if
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have somebody entering into treatment
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
and detoxing not knowing that benzo
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
Asians might be in their system or in
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
their drug supply for as long as a year
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
two years three years we don't know what
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
their benzodiazapine you know has
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
exposure has been like that to me is
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
very concerning um additionally um Le
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
levam Leva missile is a new contaminant
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
that's starting to show up in
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um this is going to cause
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
serious wounds the same way that
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
xylazine is but these wounds are going
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
to create deeper abscesses into the
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
tissue which um is going to it's a whole
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
bigger Beast currently xylazine wounds
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
resemble and kind of react like Burns
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
severely like third degree
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
burns um these wounds are going to be
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
much deeper into the tissue sometimes
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
into the muscle um some bone infections
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
things like that it it's not these are
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
not going to be wounds that are going to
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
be able to be treated at street level
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
with some of our own wound treatment
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
Specialists that go out to people so
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
those are two substances right off the
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
bat that I would love to know the
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
saturation in New Hampshire and and what
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is going to start to look like
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I've got one last one and then
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
so you know obviously it's wonderful
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
that we can now test for the two
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
substances right yeah um I'm just
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
curious as I read the original intent of
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
this and even the amend potential
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
amendments to this version it's really
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
about creating space so that as our
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge of um of the drug Supply
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
changes things can have a quick pivot to
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
to test for things to hopefully prevent
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
um I mean not just harm reduction but
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
also to help bring awareness to things
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
you know like I think about when car
 
01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
fenel which is an elephant tranquilizer
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
started getting introduced on top of
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
fenel into a number of things I'm not
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
sure what the status of car fenel is at
 
01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:44.839 align:start position:0%
the moment and if that shows up in fenel
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
test strips or not I don't it's beyond
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
my level of knowledge um but I'm just
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
curious if if that resonates with you
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
that the idea would be that this would
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
allow us a way to Pivot quickly to test
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
for things that we don't know that we
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't know about yet because they're not
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
here yet yes yeah
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
um in public health I think the scariest
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
thing um for you is what you don't know
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I don't know and that
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
that unknown is what is scariest to me
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
because it took us a while to build
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
strategies mostly in part with people
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
who use drugs around preventing Serious
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
injury and fatalities related to
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
xylazine but that turn around time from
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
being able to acknowledge that it's in
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply to having some really
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
successful strategies to limit the harms
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
of it um was not short it it wasn't what
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
we wanted it to be so um not having um
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
blank test strips so originally um you
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
know representative new's bill was for
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
any rapid testing strip that would have
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
been um successful for us because as we
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
speak about four different types of rap
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
rapid test strips are being created for
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
distribution to Public Health
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
departments we won't be able to utilize
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
them because the bill was limited at
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
some point in its lifespan here but
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
um you know we can look to our other
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
states around us to see what they're
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
starting to see what we're not going to
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
be able to see is a their pathway
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
through the state and how they're
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
impacting different regions much more
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
harshly than some and then we won't be
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
able to see what is here that isn't in
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what's here that isn't in
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Reed sure
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would this better be
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
addressed with a policy change a
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
communication between the state lab and
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal the uh what was the crime
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
lab the crime lab can there be like a
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
communication between the three of you I
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a a good step
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
in uh um kind of like a detour direction
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
to putting together what we currently
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
have and utilizing the most of that um
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
what we would love to see though is a
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
much wider pool of data so if we're only
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
using powders found at specific crime
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
scenes we still not you know the amount
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
of people that would come in and have
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
their substances tested or they found
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
these and now would like to have them
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
tested we would just see such a a bigger
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
pool of data thus clearing our picture
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
much much more um so in the days that I
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
went to drug testing programs about 25
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
to 30 tests were done each day that I
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
was there um and that is happening seven
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
days a week in Massachusetts so they're
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
just their picture is becoming more and
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
samples thank you representative n um
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
Miss McKinley um mentioned that she has
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
Scoops that give the amount would it be
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay for me to hand those out pass them
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
around so we can see yes thank you sure
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so 10 milligrams is a difficult um
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think that was maybe what the the
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
measurement that was decided upon in a
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
limit in the bill oh sorry you can have
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
the whole bag they're all for
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
you um because sometimes we take a 10
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
milligram pill every day or we take a 20
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
milligram pill and we see that pill in
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
our hand and we think that's a giant
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
amount um but you know the milligrams on
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
the medications that we take is a
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
concentration level and not a
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
measurement so this measurement is the
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
max amount that would be needed and
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
would be um necessary to to do this
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in in this bill when it was up
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
for discussion it was thought that
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps people who deal drugs would now
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
break their drug Supply up into 10
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
milligram baggies that's not the case as
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
you can see that's not the case and
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
would be impossible to do so I just
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to give a solid visual of what we
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
were looking
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
at thank you and I do appreciate this
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
because that was my thought that the
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
deers would continue to break it up into
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of little
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
milligrams and say look I just have my
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
little testing supply so I do appreciate
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
this sure in fact most tests are
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually done um with the residue in a
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
cooker or a cotton or a residue of a
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
baggie that people are bringing in most
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
people are not bringing in their
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
substance they're bringing in something
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
with residue and we're more than able to
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
do a test um with any of
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
those thank you any other
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much I appreciate
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
you so I think we've heard a great
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
amount of testimony and some good back
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
and forth with my uh fellow
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives we might just now be
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
going in a circle uh I'd ask if anyone
 
01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
wishes to provide a motion at this time
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
go go ahead represent S I just I see
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
that we do have other people in the room
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if any of them like have a
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
specific thing that we you know I know
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony earlier in the year
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
but as we're doing this today if there's
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
someone who's maybe brought some
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
information that we are not aware that
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know um before we continue and
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
then I also wonder whether there's
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
openness to developing an amendment at
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
all that would allow us to to move
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
forward with something to allow for
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
additional harm reduction measures
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
especially since I had to borrow
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative new's readers in order to
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
see the bottom of the
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
scoop it's there I trust me I can see it
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
just for now uh is there anyone else
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak and uh
 
01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak and uh
representative

01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
selig I would like to put this to vote
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
but in the interim before we get it back
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee if anyone would want to
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
develop an amendment and this is where I
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
this extra time I think that if I can
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
gut it to present my own Amendment and
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
maybe representative musef take whatever
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
we said today and tweak yours a little
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
bit I think that would be great I'm
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
definitely open for the Amendments I
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
just don't want to see it to completely
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
die but as is for me maybe others up
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
here that I I can't I can't go with this
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
right now is there anyone else that
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak sir maybe you could just
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
up my name is Jason
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
Blackburn um I don't have any new
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
information to add um the woman that
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
spoke before for me is very highly
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable um I just have a little
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
bit of a personal statement that I
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make um my name is Jason
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
Blackburn um well excuse me let me back
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
up honorable representatives of the
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire my name is Jason
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
Blackburn and I am a person in long-term
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
recovery I currently work in Behavioral
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
Health on the front lines of substance
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
challenges I've been in recovery from
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
substance use for 15 years in that time
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
I have lost count at the number of
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
people I have cared about that have lost
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
their lives from
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
overdose Halloween night
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
2013 I came home to find my best friend
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
and roommate Eden overdosed in the
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom I performed chest compressions
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
on him until EMS
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
arrived they did all they
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
could this Halloween will Mark the 10th
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
year he has been gone I firmly believe
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
that fentel played a part in his is
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
death the current state of the drug
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
Supply in this whole country is
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
toxic having the ability to test drugs
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
can save a life items such as Fentanyl
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and xylazine test strips are harm
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
reduction tools not drug
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia just as much as noxin and
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
sterile syringes are all harm reduction
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
tools are necessary components of
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
battling the ongoing overdose EP
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
epidemic why very simply put no one can
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
attempt to begin to embrace substance
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
use recovery if they are
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
dead noxin saves lives sterile syringes
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
save lives fentel and xylazine test
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
strips save lives thank you for allowing
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
me the time to speak
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:30.510 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's been a requests for a caucus
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:32:49.629 align:start position:0%
 
recess

01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
we will now be reopening the criminal
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
justice subcommittee work session on
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
470 and
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
I representative Reid for a
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
motion um thank you Mr chairman I vote
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
to itl the bill I'll second the motion
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
PR representative Reed do you wish to
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
speak upon your motion I do um we I this
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
was a very hard decision to come to
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
because the public safety aspect of
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
testing is critical and very and um
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
Paramount I um struggle with all the um
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
nebulous areas of of the bill and the
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that allows
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
um a lot of um potential abuse so um
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
that is the only reason I suggest
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
itl represent Pro uh I'm in the same
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
predicament right so I think there's a
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
lot of good to testing and we need to
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
make that work but we also in this need
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
to close the backd doors and I'm hoping
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh between my colleagues and and you
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
guys over there that we can get a better
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to close some of those things
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
so and then I'm off of this right and
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things I would
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
really like to find out
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
is in Massachusetts in Rhode Island I
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
believe is where it's
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
happening do they have a back door
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's being abused and or did they find
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
a way to close it so I would like to
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
look at that and maybe put that in our
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it's working down there and
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
how they get it to work down there
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
without this uh and I was really glad
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
that you brought me that uh spoon to
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
really visualize you know I know what it
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
is but to see it in in that little
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
amount and tell me that yeah sometimes
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
we just use the residue from the bag
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they have uh was very helpful to
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
get my head around
 
01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.550 align:start position:0%
get my head around
this

01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
so because you know I would really like
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
to pass it and say well if the back door
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
gets abused we could close it later but
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
I know that never happens never happens
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
or it's very hard to get that to happen
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
because once it's gone through it just
 
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to look at it again and try
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
and fix it so I think we need to fix it
 
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
right here right now before it goes to
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
our full committee for a vote and then
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
we can look at it
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you that's I agree with
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
everything my colleagues on this side
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
said we want this to work we probably
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
will have a couple weeks for this to get
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
back to Committee in the meantime maybe
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
you guys do a further Amendment we'll
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
figure something out we do want this to
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
work we really do uh but we just don't
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
want to close the back door and we want
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
people survive and live we don't want to
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
see anyone perish because of this this
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
this disease represent of
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
Cel thank you so much I I think I'm
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
confused procedurally um because you're
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking about it Ling re making an itl
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation which would kill the bill
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
and making an amendment and if it's itl
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
there's no point to an amendment and so
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the process and
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
again I'm new and so perhaps one of our
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
more experienced members
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
um Can clarify the process um but um my
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is the purpose of us
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
having the subcommittee is so that we
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
can hash out the details so that we
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
would provide a joint amendment that
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
would be from all of us or the majority
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
of us to address this rather than voting
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
because if we end up with a 3 three tie
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
we have no recommendation but then if
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
we're coming with different amendments
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm having a I guess for me I'm
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
having a hard time seeing these
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
nefarious back doors it feels to me like
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
like being afraid of the boogeyman
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
having and and again that's that's my
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
how I'm just hearing it and I'm not
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that's where we're going I
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's concerns about
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
drug dealers using things I think
 
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's easy ways to address that
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
although I'd also rather if drug dealers
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
weren't delivering these dangerous
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
substances and if that's the issue then
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
we just figured that out but I I just
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
procedurally I'm very confused by the
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
motion to itl and then the talk of
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
amending um
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you the boogeyman is real and
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
they do show up and I've been there and
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
I've seen the boogeyman uh I would like
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
to as the chair think of how it is
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
procedurally and I'll definitely refer
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
to representative Muse after my belief
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
is this is a recommendation to the
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee it will be brought to the
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee the committee can then hear
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
further amendments in that committee uh
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
we would then vote on it it would then
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
either go to the house maybe without a
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation we could even still amend
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
it before we vote on it in the house
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding of it and
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
definitely representative Muse correct
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong it happens a
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
lot oh that and that's okay it's taken
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
me three terms to actually catch on to
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
some of this my stuff myself but um as a
 
01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we have several
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
different ways we can go one is we can
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
make no recommendation at all then what
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
happens is the bill goes back to the
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
full committee and people just vote
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
wherever the the chips May lie
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
um we can recommend um itl um and if itl
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
is the recommendation of the you know
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
majority uh of of the committee then the
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee would vote the full committee
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
would vote on the itl
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation um but because it's an
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
itl recommendation no Amendment would be
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
possible uh in committee what would be
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
possible would be uh a a floor Amendment
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
if we if we kind of fought it on the
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
fought it on the floor so if we had an
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
itl recommendation
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
um what one of the options for us would
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
be to oppose the itl recommendation on
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
the floor and also to include a floor
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment you know which realistically I
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
don't think is the way we want to do
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
this thing I think what we'd rather do
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
is to try to come together on some kind
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
of an amendment so the the other thing
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we can do is we can work together
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
on an amendment we can vote on on an
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um one of the things that we
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
can do is we you know to kind of get
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
there sort of what I tried to do today
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
which was to take the previous Amendment
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and sort of show you in a marked up
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
msword version what it kind of looks
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
like in the original bill um and then
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
what we would do you know once we kind
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
of agree on the parameters of of of an
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is we would go back to uh
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
legislative services and legislative
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
Services would actually create um a
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
formal amendment that we would vote on
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
in a subcommittee so what we would would
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
do if we created an amendment would be
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
our recommendation back to the full
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee would be ought to pass with
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and then the full committee
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
would would would vote on that and and
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
as always we vote on them separately so
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
the committee would first have to pass
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then we would have to
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have to pass the Bill uh as
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment an an option for the full
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee um and I'm I'm not 100% sure
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
if this is an option for us from a
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation perspective but one of of
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
the things that you can do with a bill
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the second year is to uh is to
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
recommend it go to interim
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
study um and so
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
realistically interim study can be sort
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
of a nicer way to kill a bill um but I
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
think one of the things uh you know to
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
note is that we've actually had some
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
success on our committee of actually
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
sent remanding a bill to interim study
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
um discussing it and then recommending
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
it for future
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
legislation the the problem with interim
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
study is you know when you're in a
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
situation where there's a crisis and
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do things to make
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
things better all we all we can really
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
do at the end of that is make a
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a future legislature
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill like this we're not
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
actually passing the legislation
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves so essentially what it means
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
is a year delay in in in doing something
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
so what I would say if there's if
 
01:41:23.229 --> 01:41:23.239 align:start position:0%
there's willingness to to work together
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
on an amendment um so we can move this
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
thing forward I would love to do
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you representa re I agree I
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
would but I would want to go line by
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
line together okay and then once we
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
agree line by line that's the amendment
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
we we present to um Os or yeah legal
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
services and that's right and I mean you
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
know based on experience with this um I
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
I think that when there's Goodwill on
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
the side of you know both parties we can
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually go through a process like that
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
to to do it and it also gives us the
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of go through things
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
that um like the rationale for some
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
things um you know being xed out of the
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
original Bill and other things other
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
things appearing and I I think a in
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
large part what we're trying to do with
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't necessarily to uh you
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
know create you know big drug checking
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
centers you know like like they have in
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
some states but I think what we're
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we're trying to get drug
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
checking into the into the control Drug
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
Act we're trying to eliminate a
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
situation where public health
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
professionals can actually be charged
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
with a crime of you know for helping
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
with jug checking and things like that
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
which is a possibility now um and most
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
important of all we're we're trying to
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
make a dent in these overdose
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
fatalities understood but I mean um look
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
at Oregon you know Washington um
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia New York they're all fa
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
colossal failures we have to be able to
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
to do better um all
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
around and you know and I think that
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
this need we need to look at this and
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
protect this the the person on the
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
street um but not have that happen we
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with Oregon
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
Washington New York Philadelphia of San
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
Francisco we don't want that for New
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt uh we we're definitely in
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
agreement we're going to work together
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh because it's seems like we're both of
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
us are all having like the uh the
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
testimony again my concern was that we'd
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
run out of time uh do you know the time
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
restraints that we have to get this back
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
to committee I know it was November uh
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
does anyone know the time limits when we
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
know
no

01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
time so that would be the Brad the full
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation has is due by
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
yep thank thank you so much so I guess
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is that gives us time I
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
was confused I thought we had to get
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
this right out and then we would itl it
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
and then try to throw in our our motions
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me our amendments but
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative Muse thank you for
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
filling Us in everyone is in agreement
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to meet up down the
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
road I know we don't want to keep coming
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
back but we this is something where all
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
of us really want to make this happen
 
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.950 align:start position:0%
of us really want to make this happen
representative

01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
Cel said what would you be open to
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the I I'm gonna withdraw my
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
second right now sorry I'm
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
just we're we're slowly getting into
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
where we all know it uh would uh
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Reed like to resend her
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes I will resend my itl and
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative appr your second I
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
withdrew it withdrew on okay so go ahead
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering whether we even
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
right now can start working through some
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the language or if you want to have a
 
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
of the language or if you want to have a
sub

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
sub
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
sub whatever how whatever number it is
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
sorry my words are a little messy um but
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
to to work out like whether there's a
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
way we can bang the language round back
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
and forth to get this to an acceptable
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
place and then meet again next you know
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
give ourselves till next week maybe to
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
work on language that we can all try to
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
work to agree to and then create an
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment or for my scheduling purposes
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
I will not unfortunately be able to do
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
that today but if we can plan all of us
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
together to plan maybe a 5 hour day not
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
saying we will but we can all put it
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
together bang heads and then we can work
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
it out and then we'll get our vote
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully all 60 OTP uh representative
 
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
Muse what I would suggest is that we all
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
go through um the marked up version that
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
I included today if there are I can send
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
that to people electronically as well
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll do that just so you have you
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
all have copies of it what I would
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
suggest is if there are areas in there
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
that are problematic for you Circle them
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
and then just jot down really quickly
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
why it's problematic for you as we're
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
going through the bill one of the things
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we can do is we can talk about
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
those areas but I think one of the
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
things that's important from a process
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint is not necessarily letting an
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
early bump in the road keep us from
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
having a robust discussion about the
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
entire bill so if there's something that
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're not agreeing on one
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that I find with
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is that sometimes if you
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
just keep talking um and you and you
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
start to address other issues some kind
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
of a solution to the earlier impass can
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes make itself available um and
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
so what I would suggest that we do is
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
rather than letting anything like that
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
become an impediment to us doing
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
anything um we just put it in a parking
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
lot and we move on to the next thing and
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh and then at the end we revisit the
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
things that we need to revisit and try
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
to come to agreement on those as well
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
but but but to me that that seems like a
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
good process for um you know for getting
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
to a better place just a reminder that
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
we can't be legislating in private right
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
why we have to have open meetings so we
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
can put I'm thinking like my view is I
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
don't like this and we can decide to to
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
create an amendment with that whoever is
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
writing it but then we need to really
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
discuss why this and
 
01:47:47.709 --> 01:47:47.719 align:start position:0%
that here right so I can look at this
 
01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:51.639 align:start position:0%
and say I want this out and that for an
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think that's as far as
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
we can go one of the things that we I
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
believe we do have the ability to do
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
would be to cockus on things so you guys
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
can cockus and we can caucus yes and so
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
we can't cockus together that's right or
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
and I can't I can't uh I I can't you
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
know meet Jeff at Dunkin Donuts and work
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
it out there I mean we can't do that
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
stuff have it on camera and they can
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
view US yeah but but one of the one of
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
the things that we we we can do or my
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we can develop
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
caucus proposals um and something like
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
that may actually help because some
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes I find that even you know even
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
working among among my fellow Dems just
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
sort of just aggress just being able to
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
address points that we're not quite
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
understanding the same way uh can be
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
really helpful just to kind of getting
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
us all on the same page so I think I
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
think that's something um that could be
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
done it's not a
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
and what it and what it would not do is
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
preclude any member of the committee
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
from basically saying whatever they want
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
or you know expressing the fact that
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
they may not agree with a particular
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
change everybody else is set with and um
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
but it it is important that um you know
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is a public meeting and we are
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing this out in the
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
open as much as possible and I and I
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
think we need to respect
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
that so represents representative selig
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
I just was going to say in terms of
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
meeting next week I could do Tuesday
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Thursday schedule wise um I
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
can't do Monday or Friday but I can do
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
any of the three in between Halloween or
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
second that's correct I I
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
just I have things on on the bracket
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
do Wednesday definitely not I have small
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
children and I have to be the The Candy
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
Man you mean Tuesday's Halloween so for
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
for my town uh Pelham we do it always on
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
Halloween uh I know some towns do it
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
like on the weekends or whatever uh and
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
I I do plan on us being here for at
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
least a couple hours to really bang this
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
out and you know see what we're going to
 
01:50:08.109 --> 01:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
put together and then we can go to OS
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment and hopefully we vote
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
it out as an OTP 60 so we're looking at
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
the first WN we can do Wednesday the 1
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
probably another 10: a.m. sure sound
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we will eventually move this
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
to Wednesday November 1st at 10: a.m.
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I yep
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
yes just you you've made reference to
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
the a number of things that you guys
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
specifically want to make sure gets
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
changed out of here could would you be
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
willing to just give me a sample of one
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
line doesn't have to be many of one
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
thing you'd like change just so that I
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
can have a greater understanding other
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
than like the broad idea but just just
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that I can help work on preparing for
 
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.109 align:start position:0%
so that I can help work on preparing for
next

01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
week uh page two starting line 16 of the
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
original Bill all the striking out
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
wordage of processing preparing the
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
included I basically eliminated the
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
entire in my head the uh wait I'm Sor so
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
on the original
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
Bill not the Amendments yes so page two
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
line 16 XA drug paraphernalia okay yes
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
sorry this was me and this is not their
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts they have their own but I
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to delete all of that because
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
that is in in essence changing the
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
definition of 38 B1 which is drug
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia this is where I started to
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
have in my mind the back door for the uh
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
the dealers to be able to use this I had
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
thought about maybe eliminating that and
 
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
then putting it in with maybe even the
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
the fentel bill that just passed fentel
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
strips that except for and again I don't
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
know the verbiage off the top of my head
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
but that's where I was looking forward
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
to maybe put it in with that so that
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
this 318 B1 would not penalize the
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
person who wishes to use the test
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
materials but it would still punish the
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
nefarious characters okay and you we can
 
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
go representative re or representative
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
you I have an issue with the very last
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
page um Roman numeral
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
five with all of that included in the
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
amendment in the in the in the amendment
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
the this one right
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
here I don't know if Muse gave you that
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
yeah there you go last page um it said
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
um there's just um a lot in there that I
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
think um would end up hurting the person
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh the substance abuser as a and helping
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
um the nefarious characters and I will
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
refine that for our next
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
meeting um and all the all the words
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
included in the drug paraphernalia
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.149 --> 01:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
eye your turn I'm good for
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
now does that somewhat help yes sorry
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much I just for me
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
talking up here makes it really hard and
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
I it it's helpful to me to have some
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
concrete steps to look at yeah I I was
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
in the same boat I'm looking at it
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
putting it down walking away coming back
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
like I was like a mad man with this bill
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
like I want this to work but then I'm
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm tolling like which way do I go I
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't want the bad guys coming in but I
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
want people to live so that's where in
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
my head I was really like circling but
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
let's make this work uh one last Quick
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
I I just want to thank you again I know
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
that at the beginning of our
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
conversation today there was a sort of
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
set we're going to end with this result
 
01:53:59.550 --> 01:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that we've shifted from
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
that to having a conversation to looking
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
at how we can have true bipartisanship
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
for the greater good of New Hampshire
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
rather than for any one individual so
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely and I will hereby
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
close this subcommittee work session on
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
