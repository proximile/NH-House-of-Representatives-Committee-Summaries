accuracy which is which is good enough
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
but would everybody take a look to see
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
chair would like to call associate
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner Christine centeniello to
 
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner Weaver was
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
unable to be here today so she actually
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
asked me to give two updates to the
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee if that's okay
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
all right perfect
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
um the first one and luckily we do have
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
Henry Littman here so um if we have
 
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
specific questions Henry can address
 
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
specific questions Henry can address
them

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
um when
 
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
um his time so first of all is Dental
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the critical pieces is
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
as you all know the dental benefit went
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
into effect April 1st this really has
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
filled an unmet need
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
um critical for many of our residents
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's many many stories I think one of
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
the most impactful is a person
 
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
the most impactful is a person
um

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
who has never had dental treatment
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
before and when the benefit passed you
 
00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 align:start position:0%
was actually able to see a dentist so
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's such a connection so that's
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
wonderful to date we have 112 unique
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
dental providers which is nearly
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
doubling the amount in a month
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
um there's 23 providers in 12 location
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
are in Border towns but services are
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
offered in 274 different locations Delta
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
yep I just want to be looking at what
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at are you looking at at
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
this document where it says Network
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
recruitment dashboard yes
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay I just wasn't mapping the numbers
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
until has done
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
they have paid a provider sign-on bonus
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
um about a thousand dollars per office
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
and that'll go through the end of April
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
so that's been really helpful the mobile
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
van is returning to follow-up Karen
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
Colebrook on April 29th and May 12th and
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
13th in Concord
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
and was continuing to work on additional
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
come on up Henry there's going to be
 
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.409 align:start position:0%
come on up Henry there's going to be
questions

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Senator Rosenwald with
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
a question yes thank you thank you for
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
this update do you have do we have any
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
sense of of the contracted providers
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
whether they're
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
taking them to the same extent
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
that they're accepting any other new
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
patients or are they saying yes I'll
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
sign the contract but then they take
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
a very limited number of Medicaid
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
patients do we know that
 
00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:57.500 align:start position:0%
no but
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
I do think that um
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
has has come out in other discussions
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
about managing a practice that you know
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
a given practice that if they're an
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
independent practice has to manage their
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
their pair mix to a certain extent so
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
but we are trying to measure if you will
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
will be measuring that that the access
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
is comparable to what isn't in the
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
commercial Market that probably take a
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
little time to to evaluate thank you
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.449 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
chair

00:09:31.449 --> 00:09:31.459 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for all the work that you're
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
putting in on us one of the things I'm
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
hoping to see at some point is a map of
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's got a heat map kind
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
of look to it to where places where we
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh any support would be
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
very Vis visually noticeable is that
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
coming next month you think or I believe
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
it is we did get a very extensive uh
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
sort of document on the different
 
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
mapping that Delta Dental is doing and
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
understanding that I think you might
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
have used the word utility that we want
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
something that you know it's not 84
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
pages in length but they're something
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we can sort of summarize that is
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
good from a policy maker standpoint
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
we'll work over the next month to get
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
that it would do me with just one page
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
basically it just had the picture of
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
where we're hot and we're cold and and
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
these statistics that you're running
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
here on contacts and everything this is
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
this is really good to have as well but
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and now am I asking you for something
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
that we don't have uh the right software
 
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420 align:start position:0%
for to to
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
orders I don't want to accidentally be
 
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
asking you for this enormous
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic exercise to create a heat
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
map I'm assuming that there's a software
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
tool that could do this relatively
 
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.310 align:start position:0%
tool that could do this relatively
easily

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
easily
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
so Delta Dental and their their partner
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
subcontractor that does administrative
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
Services is working with Delta Dental to
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
um to produce something along the lines
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
of what you have and what I'll try to do
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
is between now and next meeting give you
 
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:13.700 align:start position:0%
some updates on that um in terms of
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
getting to that heat map kind of concept
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
that we talked about it may take us a
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
couple tries but you know understand we
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
are trying to get to what you're trying
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and I would expect since their their
 
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
subcontract uh DentaQuest
 
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.420 align:start position:0%
um you know was the largest of all the
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
administrators in the in the Medicaid
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
space that they'll come to being able to
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
produce a product that will will meet
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
your needs in the committee's needs it's
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
just one small clarification I I hear
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
all that that's all great I I I just
 
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't want it to have to turn into some
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
big exercise to go buy some new software
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere and train people how to use it
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
and all that if I'm asking for something
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's not really practical just tell me
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
I think I would like to have what you're
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
talking about and I haven't reached a
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
point where I don't think that that's
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
possible without the state having to us
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
having to put more manpower or or uh
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
investment to get it if if we're running
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
into that I'll come back to you to let
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
you know and I'll try to let you know
 
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
early but we'll get you something thank
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.850 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:24.860 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for the dashboard
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
in regards to the 112 unique providers I
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
noticed that on the dashboard we have
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
both New Hampshire Vermont Maine and
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
mass is part of the catchment area
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the 112 unique providers how many of
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
those actually in New Hampshire versus
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head it's 23 that
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
are our border so the balance to what's
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
that 90 uh close to 90 are in state
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the if I may follow up in regards to
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
the sign on bonus it sounds encouraging
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
what requirements involved for the sign
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
on bonus scope following up on Senator
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's question is there any
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to take a certain
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
number of patients in order to qualify
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the 1 000 bonus
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the the contract between the provider
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and Delta is not something that we're
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
um you know directly involved in
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating but you know the presumption
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
is that they're going to have a
 
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.970 align:start position:0%
is that they're going to have a
reasonable

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
um level of access being provided some
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the the Border uh might be a practice
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
like some of the uh like oral surgery
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
practices are you have a network that's
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
you know it's in more than one state so
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's some of that again I think the
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
ultimately in in healthcare practices
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
whether it be a a doctor's office or a
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
dentist or a hospital or nursing home
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
that you have to have some reasonable
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
pair mix that allows you to you know to
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
to keep the lights on and pay your staff
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that's I think you know the The
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
Challenge and and then the workforce
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
shortage too but you know I think the
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
things that we added to make sure that
 
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
things that we added to make sure that
people

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um can get to their appointment but be a
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
transportation and that there's Care
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
Management to also make sure that they
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
get to the right place those are all
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
things that I think
 
00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:24.350 align:start position:0%
things that I think
um

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
and that the claims pay timely which I
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
think that's Delta's very good at doing
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
in the in the state that that as we you
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
know show that that's the way they're
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
going to experience it will do better
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
than if if that goes the other way
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so would it be possible for you to
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
get that language from Delta and bring
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
it to us next month uh because I
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
certainly would not wish that a given
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
dentist would take the thousand dollars
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
and see but one patient so I'd like to
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
see what the expectations even if
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
they're a bit General sure thank you
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
uh Senator gray not so much a question
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
but a comment
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about the dental
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
benefit I was at the Stratford County uh
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
public health network uh breakfast this
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
morning uh and you would think they were
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
talking about two different programs
 
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.129 align:start position:0%
talking about two different programs
okay

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
um you concentrated on what we've got
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
these improvements they're concentrating
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
on I still don't have dentists that will
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
take anybody because this dentist has
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
said I'm only going to take X this
 
00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:34.699 align:start position:0%
dentist is agreed you know that was
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
those positions or those those patient
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
spots have already been so again not so
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
much question just a comment that you
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
know we've got a difference between what
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
what the state you know is saying what
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
the public health networks are saying
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
and we're not there yet and money is
 
00:15:58.569 --> 00:15:58.579 align:start position:0%
probably you know the root of all that
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
and we've got budget with a 17 increase
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
right now and I keep telling the people
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
who do I take it from to give it to you
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
okay so I've made my statement now thank
 
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:13.820 align:start position:0%
you much
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh could you speak to that in terms of
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
how a better recruitment is ongoing and
 
00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.090 align:start position:0%
how a better recruitment is ongoing and
be

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
um whatever else I just forgot so I
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
think one of the the points that we'd
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
like to convey is that you know that the
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
first day of service that we had uh uh
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
on April 1st uh Delta Dental to help
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
supplement the concern that you're
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
raising they they brought in a dental
 
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:44.180 align:start position:0%
mobile provider
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
and they saw 48 patients on the first
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
day through those two sites one in
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
Colebrook and one in Concord they're
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
coming back to do their follow-up visits
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
um I think one's coming today
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
um and um the first week in May then
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
they were working with Delta to try to
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
expand that capability to help fill in
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
some of the the issue that was raised
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
there in terms of as things stand up I
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
know if most of us if we called a
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
dentist no matter what the benefit we
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
would have today if you're going for
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a routine
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
um type of thing it's it can take months
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
to get an appointment but what we do
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
have is we have a you know Dr Finney and
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
the medical director at Delta Dental
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
that if you know there's a systemic
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
infection type issue that we're
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about they'll find a way to
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
get them seen and so we're not we're not
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
where we need to be but we're we're a
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
lot better than where we were and we're
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
going to get better as time goes on
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
is it on the is it planned for
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
representatives to go to the various New
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County Republican monthly
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
meetings and Democrat monthly meetings
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
we hadn't planned that but you had until
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
now what we had not planned that until
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
now until now that's that's what I
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
wanted thank you
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you
 
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.789 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you
uh

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
not to belabor the point but
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the mapping uh what
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful if maps are
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
difficult in terms of software is to
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
know the exact town or municipality
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
because as I look at the county
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
breakdown if you map at a county level
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to tell me anything more
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
than this it if you look at the county
 
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
than this it if you look at the county
breakdown

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
the issues are as usual kawas only has
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
two and Grafton which is a huge County
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
only has three and I noticed that
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
Windsor Vermont which is convenient to
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
some but not much of Grafton County does
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
give us five more so that helps with the
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
river towns it just doesn't help with
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
anything in the warm mountainous part of
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
Grafton County so knowing exactly where
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be difficult in terms
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
of software just to provide a list of
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
towns and the number of providers per
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
down I today I have an Excel spreadsheet
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
that I could provide to give you the
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
exact address of everyone that's in the
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
network the the other thing that they're
 
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.669 align:start position:0%
network the the other thing that they're
doing

00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
um in their Deltas doing they're
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
measuring what is the time and distance
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
standard to each of the practices so
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're really doing uh those
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to evaluate things
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm very pleased with the how they're
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
collaborating with us and trying to
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant but thank you Mr
 
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
chair one of the I served on a qualified
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
Healthcare board for several years and
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we had was what
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
are called no shows and given the fact
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
that with Medicaid reimbursing being as
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
low as it is and to your point about the
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
provider having a good pair mix
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
do you know when the contract within
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental is the state willing to pay
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
for the no-show or at least to help
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
cover the provider because once the time
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
is evaporated that opportunity is lost
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's so the empty chair issue is one of
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
the key factors when we were talking
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
about the benefit with providers who are
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
involved in it and so our approach to
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is to provide a transportation
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
benefit so if transportation is a factor
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and also care coordinators to to work
 
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:44.660 align:start position:0%
with people who may have
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
different issues that that make it
 
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:49.460 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to access the system
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think that we have to to test that
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
experience a little bit to to see
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
whether that's going to work or not but
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think you know that's a fundamental
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
issue if there's a lot of empty chair
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
time that's we're going to have to take
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
other actions to to close that because
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
that fundamentally is uh you know if
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to be altruistic
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
you you know to take your share if you
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
will then you know you don't want to be
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
penalized by both having to get nothing
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
and and pay for the staff and supplies
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
Etc are planned follow up and thank you
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
Mr and so going forward will there be
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
any tracking of that data to help us
 
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
understand this program because if we're
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of empty chairs no shows
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the overall impact
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have with providers and they're
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
willingness to take on the program if
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
we're not finding a way to keep them
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
whole financially
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a specific answer today
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions please
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
continue thank you so the next um topic
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
area is we just wanted to give an update
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
on the Medicaid unwind
 
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.210 align:start position:0%
on the Medicaid unwind
um

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm just waving oh okay all
 
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm just waving oh okay all
right

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire was one of the first
 
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.730 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire was one of the first
States

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
um to return to normal operations and
 
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:16.940 align:start position:0%
this was actually done with CMS approval
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
and primarily this is because New
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we had systems in place and
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
operations and we've been working on
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
this honestly since July of 2020. excuse
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
me associate commissioner um do we have
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
a handout on this and what does it look
 
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.570 align:start position:0%
a handout on this and what does it look
like

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
if we do
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
oh it's hiding okay thank you sorry for
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
the interruption that's okay
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
um and so I think what's really
 
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.310 align:start position:0%
um and so I think what's really
important

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
um we've heard heard a lot of
 
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.970 align:start position:0%
um we've heard heard a lot of
um

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
talk about the end of the continuous
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
coverage that we have saying people are
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
being terminated or kicked off of
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I think we really want
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to reframe that to be
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
people are in transition because some
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
people remain eligible
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
um because they still meet the
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
requirements others complete the
 
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.549 align:start position:0%
requirements others complete the
redetermination

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
redetermination
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and yet also we're not able to retain
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
certain and eligible people so we're
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
working really hard
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
um with providing information about
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
other insurance sources we work closely
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Insurance The
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
Navigators and so we're really making
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure that if people aren't eligible
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
um we work through their case with them
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
and then also we refer them the right
 
00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:36.010 align:start position:0%
and then also we refer them the right
way

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.020 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
we are taking a risk-based approach for
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
our procedures so we prioritized those
 
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.210 align:start position:0%
our procedures so we prioritized those
who

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
um we focused on the first month the
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
first couple of months are those who are
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
likely to be ineligible for Medicaid
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
based on income information they gave us
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
we also tracked it with people who
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
weren't using we took that group and
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
then looked at their claims over the
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
last few months so really to ensure that
 
00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:07.789 align:start position:0%
last few months so really to ensure that
those

00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
um who are least vulnerable would be
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
worked on first and then we delayed
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
those who are more vulnerable towards
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
the end so we can continue to try to
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
keep people on so
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
um we believe that because of how we
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
approach this the number of individuals
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
who became eligible ineligible and
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
um March is probably our highest point
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and then it'll continue to lessen over
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr could you help me
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
understand on the graph first of all
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing it's helpful
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
what the timeline is I'm assuming the
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
first number is like if you look at the
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
first one 51 366 is that back in March
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
of 2020 in the last data point is on
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
March 27th or April 24th
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the the questions so
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
what we've always been looking at is
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
from the time that sort of the
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
um kicked in so March 16th is roughly
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
that date March 16th of 2020. so we
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
we've been benchmarking against that
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
time the whole time through and so if
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
you look at the the top line of the
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
graph that
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
um the theoretical High Point was just
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
just before the end of March where we
 
00:25:35.169 --> 00:25:35.179 align:start position:0%
had 96 515 people in granted Advantage
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
154 842 in standard for a total of 251
 
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
154 842 in standard for a total of 251
357.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
357.
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
um the next line down of numbers going
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
across the 81 773 is now what is in
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage as of Monday
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the standard program has gone to 143
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
793 so as of April um 24th the the
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
enrollment stood at 225 000 566. if you
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
drop down below that we've sort of
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
developed the the blue the blue column
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
um is measuring um against
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you know what that the maximum
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment was in and what the change in
 
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.140 align:start position:0%
enrollment has been since 328 of of
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
23. so what we're what we're seeing is
 
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.810 align:start position:0%
23. so what we're what we're seeing is
that

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the risk-based strategy that
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
Chris described is that uh
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
um in the first
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
um number of months here we're seeing
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
um a hot very high percentage of people
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
who are Income ineligible so those are
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
are individuals that were automatically
 
00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:54.980 align:start position:0%
transferring to the uh to The Exchange
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
and what we understand
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
um is that the you know The Navigators
 
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:03.500 align:start position:0%
will be getting lists from The Exchange
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to make additional Outreach
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
first in the form of letter and then in
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
the form of follow-up calls so that
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who can't be eligible for
 
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
individuals who can't be eligible for
Medicaid

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's that's the the
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
biggest group right now we also have a
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
group of people that have
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
um aged out you know both in the terms
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
of uh individuals who are on granted
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
Advantage as an example who are now
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
Medicare eligible and we also had a
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
group of children that are no longer
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
children since this has gone on for
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
three years and then
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
um you know there are other people that
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
may have been categorically eligible and
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
aren't eligible anymore we're working on
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
refining our analysis of that
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
information every every week we meet
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
just every Friday to review sort of
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
metrics and
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
um we'll be able to I think as we get a
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
little bit more refinement here giving a
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
picture of what happens but
 
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.269 align:start position:0%
picture of what happens but
um

00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know our Outreach efforts I think
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
are probably Second To None I think in
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
in the country in terms of what's been
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
done to try to give people a heads up
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
and and to have an opportunity and you
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
know we're also seeing that people will
 
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.010 align:start position:0%
know we're also seeing that people will
close

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
um that you know we're looking at a sort
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
of a Lifeboat concept just because you
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
close doesn't mean that you can't reopen
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
and we've the numbers on this page
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
reflect the net effect of those two
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
things in about seven and a half percent
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
of the closures end up reopening because
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
they may not have provided information
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
but once they get the closure notice and
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
they actually close they come back and
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
we try to help them and there's also you
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
know special additional Outreach that's
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
going on on vulnerable populations so
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
someone may have aged out of Medicaid
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and on Medicare but still hasn't done
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything to sort of get coverage we're
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're making additional phone calls on
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
what we call high-touch individuals the
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
highly vulnerable and you know it's not
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
perfect because we we're working with
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
claims information to identify this type
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
of information but we certainly are
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
making I think a tremendous effort to to
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
reconnect people and and transitions are
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
people on Medicaid who lose coverage
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
have until July of of 24 to exercise a
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
special enrollment period and Medicare
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
individuals have six months from the
 
00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:19.330 align:start position:0%
individuals have six months from the
time

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:22.220 align:start position:0%
just one other piece I think we've done
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of work with providers knowing who
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're serving who needs a
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
redetermination and really connecting
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
with them as they see the people when
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
they come in their office when they do a
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
home visit yeah I think that that's been
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
a big part of our strategy is giving
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
them lists of their patients and what
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
their missing items are and so that they
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
can do Advanced Outreach the mental
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
health centers have been very good using
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
that information that's can be a tough
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
population to to um to get to complete
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
things and there's been some really good
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
work done by the providers as well as
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
our mcos thank you for being proactive
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I think Mr Lipman
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
may have actually answered it but I want
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
to be sure
 
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.490 align:start position:0%
to be sure
um

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:12.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner was testifying it
 
00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:16.490 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner was testifying it
was

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um the phrase was used not able to
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
retain certain eligible people and am I
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
correct in assuming that those are the
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
people who remained eligible but did not
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
return their paperwork so those are the
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
people you were talking about about
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
getting picked up again once they
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly realized they didn't have the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
coverage anymore now they're getting
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
paperwork in
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's actually two groups that were okay
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
103 000 individuals
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
as of Mark the end of March that were
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we call protected meaning that the
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage requirements that
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
that group we had originally forecasted
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
that about 87 of those people would
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
close in the first month in fact 71
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
percent did but the reason our closure
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
was approximately what we wanted to do
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
is those people who are just coming up
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
to their first time eligibility which we
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
didn't have information on there was a
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
certain closure rate that occurred there
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
so we're doing better on the on the on
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
the um the people who are in the
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
protected group and we need to do more I
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
think to to strengthen our Outreach
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
effort to people who've never had to
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
redetermine but haven't been protected
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
um by the law
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm just trying to
 
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:31.340 align:start position:0%
understand the chart the top seven
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
categories all tend to go up over time
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then they decliff and go down the
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
last one the children with disabilities
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
continually goes down right from the
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
get-go is that because they time out
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
because of age or is a alternative
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
coverage or do they go into the adult
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
with disabilities category how why did
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
that number go down so steadily so we've
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
we've when we shared this information
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
before we've had governor and Council
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
we've got that that question it's a
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
great question what we've been looking
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
at it it's basically aging into a
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
different category aging so it's not an
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
alternative coverage of any sort
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
generally not okay thank you
 
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.889 align:start position:0%
generally not okay thank you
meaning

00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
more people age out than are being born
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
and coming in
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
know that someone who is say 16 at the
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
time of this and they're they're they
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
move and they're now 19 they may be in
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
the adult group as opposed to the the
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
Children's Group my question is why have
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
they not been replaced by newly born
 
00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
they not been replaced by newly born
people

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I in terms of of that I think that
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
generally we haven't seen the
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
applications because we've been
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
processing applications all the way
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
through when Chris talked about it and I
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
also think sometimes children may start
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
in under their family coverage
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um potentially and then move into a
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
specific child with disabilities
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes that does happen so
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and isn't it
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
important for us to remember that
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
although all the other lines are in the
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
multiples of thousands here we're only
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
talking a change of uh just about 150
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
kids and and our birth rates are
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
declining is that what you were
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
some on other things among other things
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.509 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Rosenwald thank you
um

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
I know that but you know but March of
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
2020 we had about 125
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
000 people on traditional Medicaid and
 
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.029 align:start position:0%
000 people on traditional Medicaid and
50

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
000 about on expansion are you expecting
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
by the end of this calendar year
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to get back to those numbers
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
or do you think we're still going to be
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
at a higher case load for one reason
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
for another
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
um you know again we've got like six
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
weeks of experience here we're moving
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
into the more challenging cases as we
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
progress in but I think we're going to
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
be approaching within a years of time of
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
March I think too where we were
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
um you know given the same economic
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
conditions today as you know the
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
employment and other things are at a
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
very low level that the economy has goes
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
into a recession that could affect the
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
the the the numbers but I think you'll
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
kind of on a steady state basis of where
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
we are now I think we are going to be
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
reapproaching that and it also as you
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
know that in the grand Advantage piece
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
that people cycle in off on that and so
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
you know depending on layoffs and other
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
things that go on in the world you know
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire's very pretty well
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
but other parts of the country depending
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
on the the concentration of their
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
industry you know there's a lot of I.T
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
layoffs going on now I can say a state
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
like California with the big uh vendors
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
there but this really granted Advantage
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
was driven by unemployment temporary
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
losses of coverage
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
of the people who have been disenrolled
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
because you've determined they are no
 
00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:23.900 align:start position:0%
longer eligible do you have a any
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
information for us on the
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
percentages of reasons is it because
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
their income is too high or they have
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
other insurance options or they've moved
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
or is there information you can provide
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
us yes it's not today some other time
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
yes I think that um to give you some
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
sense again with six weeks of
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
information about half the individuals
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
are related to income eligibility then
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
there is probably the next largest group
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
of people who despite all the efforts
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
didn't complete their their paperwork
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
but we're tracking that and we'll be
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
able to report on that uh but you know
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
the information is still kind of green
 
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:13.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
relying on it completely but we we are I
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
think we've referred over close to 19
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
000 people so far to The Exchange
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative Edwards
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I first I I've been
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
hearing about the Medicaid unwind for
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
about a year in various venues and I
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
just really appreciate the assertiveness
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
with which the department has been
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with this this is you're going
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
to set us up for as much success as we
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
can get from a program like this so I
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm curious
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that these numbers are
 
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.630 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that these numbers are
all

00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
um uh embedded in our three mcos
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
business operations and so as I look at
 
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:10.220 align:start position:0%
it longer and longer I start to wonder
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
if all three of our mcos are going to
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
end up in
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
a relatively the same places where they
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
got started do we have any issues where
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
we need to worry that
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
by pulling some of the population out of
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
the business that we're going to
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
disproportionately harm one MCO over
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
another or are they all pretty much in
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
the same boat that's a very good
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
question uh so when we did the original
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
procurement and that went to effect in
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
September of 19 that generally what we
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
understood from The mcos Who bid at that
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
time that they needed at least 50 000
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
population to be able to um you know get
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
to a a viable
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
um if you will level to to make the
 
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.550 align:start position:0%
um if you will level to to make the
Investments

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you know one MCO is based on this
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
enrollment is just dropped below that
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
but when we started the program we had
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to be able to for
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
people who did not make a choice of
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
which plan that they wanted that we did
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
an algorithm to to try to get that that
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
one plan up to sort of the viability
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
level I think depending on on how that
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
goes we may have to use that tool again
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
because we benefit by having choice for
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries and and and it helps
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
us in terms of controlling the cost and
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I do think that you know as a plan
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
matures they also have some
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do good marketing and
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
provide good services to get more people
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
to choose their plan so well I think we
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
can try to help we can't guarantee and
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's why I think if we were able to do
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
the next procurement that that you know
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
that will be a factor as to whether
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
someone wants to stay in the market and
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
some new someone new might come in
 
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.270 align:start position:0%
some new someone new might come in
um

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay so this is this is what I'm storing
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
from what you just said that that it is
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
in fact uh an important state objective
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
for us to have at least three MCO so
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
that we can have a competitive situation
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that is it stands now there's some
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
indication that uh uh we may have some
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
challenges in that area but that you're
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
working through them as best you can but
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately at the end of the day this is
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
a competitive market and they have to
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
just perform
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that's you know the
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
plans that are been here will have been
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the the market for almost five years
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
and you know through this service and
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
their extra benefits that they might
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
offer is part of the way that they have
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
great that's all I have for the
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioners update today thank you Mr
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
lippman if we ever get a national
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
single-payer health program would you
 
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
you're up next all right so I guess the
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
the next topic you were looking computer
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:30.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
the next topic I think you wanted us to
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
address was Senate Bill uh 263 which I
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
know chairman McDonald uh is probably
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
better even better able to update than
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
than I can but uh as I think everybody
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
knows that came over from the the Senate
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh on the unanimous vote uh
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
HHS and DNA committee
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
um have their first discussions of that
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
at executive level
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be a number of uh of
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
issues that uh that members of the
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
committee wish to talk about and I don't
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
know whether it might be better to have
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh chairman McDonald to address that but
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh I can kick in here or however you'd
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
like me to
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
well let me ask chairman McDonald's to
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
hold forth and you folks can go you two
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
can go back and forth if you wish
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
without being recognized as nod thank
 
00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:26.329 align:start position:0%
without being recognized as nod thank
you

00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
um Health and Human Services and elderly
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh as since a number of the
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee members are present this
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
morning had an extensive discussion
 
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:42.020 align:start position:0%
about SB 63 263 this past Wednesday
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
we did not make any decisions it is
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
clear that there are numerous amendments
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
forthcoming on the bill that will be
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
discussed that our next executive
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
session is coming Wednesday but there
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
was extensive discussion on both sides
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
um pro and con as far as
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
as far as the sunset how long a sunset
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
should there be a sunset that was
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
obviously a main topic but um no votes
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
were taken no amendments were formally
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
considered a couple were distributed and
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are again numerous others
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
numerous numerous others apparently that
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
will be a forthcoming and we anticipate
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing on the at this
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
upcoming executive session
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
um that's that's unfortunately that's
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot else I can I can share
 
00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:37.579 align:start position:0%
but I certainly invite any other members
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
by May Mr chairman representative Weber
 
00:42:43.569 --> 00:42:43.579 align:start position:0%
I may want to speak to this also
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
chairman and Mr chairman
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's important to recognize
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
that most of the discussion that
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
happened this past week was a far and
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
free-ranging discussion of the entire
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
state of the health care delivery system
 
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:08.900 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh the state of economics and social
 
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:16.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the entire world and uh
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
concerns about the Medicaid Program in
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
general and not a lot of specifics about
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 263 so we're just going to
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
have to as far as I'm concerned we're
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
just going to have to wait and see how
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
that unfolds because a lot of what's
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
coming either hasn't been formulated yet
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
or hasn't been shared because there
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
might be more
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
formulation coming we have we have a
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
couple of specifics that have been
 
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:46.700 align:start position:0%
shared but I think that
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
those are fairly narrow and clear it's
 
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
the broader stuff that's going to be an
 
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.250 align:start position:0%
the broader stuff that's going to be an
issue

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:54.260 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh yes it was as you know far
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
reaching and um uh discussion on
 
00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:03.650 align:start position:0%
reaching and um uh discussion on
Wednesday

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think one of the
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
um more poignant you know uh concerns
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
that I heard
 
00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:13.579 align:start position:0%
among others was the permanency issue
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would just like to hear
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
your thoughts about the pros and cons of
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
a two-year permanency five-year
 
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
permanency versus indefinite permanency
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
meaning that at some point if Medicaid
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
goes away as a federal program along
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
with the state I'm assuming that would
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
end our program here as well so I I
 
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
guess I would like your general thoughts
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
about the sequencing of two five and
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
then indefinite permanency
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
so on the the two-year standpoint I
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
think the advantage of that
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
time frame is that there's a formal Hab
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
as I think came out in committee
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussion there's you have to actually
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
reconsider it the the downside of it
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
from administering the program and
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
looking at you know what what is
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
probably larger than a six billion
 
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
dollar contract is that it puts us at a
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in terms of the competition
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
that we have in terms of trying to put
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and maintain a contract in place
 
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:13.970 align:start position:0%
and maintain a contract in place
um

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
the The Five-Year
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I think generally what we
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
understood from the past procurement is
 
00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
understood from the past procurement is
that

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a to be a new entrant as a
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
significant investment in terms of time
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
and effort to build out a network and
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
set up systems and what have you that
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know coming into the market not
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
knowing whether the Market's going to be
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
large enough to support a new entrant um
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
because if we lose the granted Advantage
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
Program it wouldn't be viable for for
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
three plans likely
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
um and so that that I think is a
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
disadvantage you know from an
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
Administration standpoint that that we
 
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.329 align:start position:0%
Administration standpoint that that we
see

00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:52.339 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
the way that the not have to I made a
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
note card on this to carry around with
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
me but the way the
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
um you can actually put all of this on a
 
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:07.569 align:start position:0%
um you can actually put all of this on a
notepad

00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:07.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
um you know if it was was done
 
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.569 align:start position:0%
um you know if it was was done
um

00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:16.849 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
see if I can read my notes
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that the the
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
misalignment of five years is that we
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
would we'd have like about
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
um nine months or eight months that
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
um they'd be so uncertainty as to
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be renewed versus uh 34
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
months if it's a two-year
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
reauthorization which I think that's
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's my concern in terms of getting
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
the state the best deal and our
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
our beneficiaries the best benefit plan
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
that we can put in place if there's not
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
competition for
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that I think five years is a little
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
bit of uncertainty I think the market
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
can can can tolerate something like that
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
six years would be ideal because it
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
would cover the length of the the
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
reprocurement and we've been doing it in
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
five-year increments since the since
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
managed care even before we had rented
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
Advantage as a program I think uh
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the the other part of the
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
conversation that came up is every
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
whatever is passed is really good for
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
two years in the sense of that you know
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
the next legislature can come through
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
and do that but I think you know that
 
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
the practice has been to honor what's
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
been been passed um let me ask a
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
question let me ask a question about
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
this as a person who tries to be
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
compassionate and Frugal at the same
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
time sometimes pulling it off
 
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:34.849 align:start position:0%
time sometimes pulling it off
um

00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
would the cost of the two years
 
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
in a two-year plan be greater than the
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
first two years of A Five-Year Plan
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
given how bidding goes
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think the cost would be higher if
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
there's a two only a two-year and
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
effectively it's 16 months because the
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
the the current reauthorization runs
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
through December
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and so it would only be a 16-month
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
contract which is even worse than two
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
years for um someone who'll be
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
considering coming into the market as a
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
competitor could you has a
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
estimation as to the difference of two
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
years in a two-year plan versus the two
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
years of A Five-Year Plan with the two
 
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
years and a two-year plan be a ten
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
percent higher bid a 20 percent higher
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
bid what I guess even if it's a very low
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
percentage even if it was five percent
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
five percent on a six billion dollar
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
contracts real money
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess you know a range I
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
would put would be probably in the five
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
to to ten percent as being you know a
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable planning uh number
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
um because you know underlying
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
um you know any contract is ultimately
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
the the medical costs that that have to
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
be incurred
 
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.650 align:start position:0%
be incurred
um irrespective

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
um irrespective
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I jumped in thank you and just so
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're clear
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
um if if we're setting aside the
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
two-year plan
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and going with something that meshes
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
with a five-year procurement
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
interval isn't it true that we really
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to talk about a six-year and you
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
said this already but I just want to be
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
sure we're all clear about it because we
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
keep throwing out the five-year
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
extension and isn't it true that if
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to cover the full
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
period of another five-year contract we
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
need to have that six-year extension
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
that you referred to so we should all be
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
in our brains adjusting to a six-year
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
extension if we want if what we want to
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
do is cover the next contract cycle that
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
is correct okay I just I just want to be
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
really clear on that because for those
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
of us who do not sit on finance and
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
can't remember which
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
July then the next fiscal year starts at
 
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.290 align:start position:0%
July then the next fiscal year starts at
um

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:02.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
I know but but I can never remember
 
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:06.980 align:start position:0%
whether it's the date that's ahead or
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's the year right
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
um anyway those of us who have trouble
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
calculating that if we could just all
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
remember that uh to cover a full
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
contract renewal we need to do a
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
six-year extension if that is our intent
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
yes I think that when I talk five years
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
I think what to me again this is my my
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
view of it and that there could be
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
alternative viewers I think it shows
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the state has at least the
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
commitment equal to what it entered into
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
this contract because we've got a
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
five-year reauthorization I think that
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
sends a different signal to the
 
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.790 align:start position:0%
sends a different signal to the
marketplace

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
um six years I think is guarantees us
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
that they understand we're there um five
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
years could work as well but you know it
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
does have it could have some impact that
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
I can't quantify for you exactly but I
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
do think sending a signal that we're
 
00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
less committed to the program uh like
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
with a two-year reauthorization does
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
affect I think you know what the
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
administrative side of this looks like
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
Murphy

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman uh just a follow-up
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I think it was just a dress but I
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear and in the spirit
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
of compromise and as we will be
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
addressing this obviously next Wednesday
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
once again and also coming from somebody
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
who will obviously be running the
 
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:27.980 align:start position:0%
national Healthcare program as
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards suggested my I'm
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
taking the blame for that
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
my question is I just want to be clear
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know as opposed to permanency into
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
the future indefinitely Or a two-year
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
plan in the ideal World running this
 
00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:45.500 align:start position:0%
administratively as a six-year
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
extension of the program give you
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
comfort in running the program for the
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of efficiency and for the
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh I've heard Mr lutman also that in
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
terms of debating the five versus six
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
versus two uh it's my understanding
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
anything less than five it's very hard
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
to get people to bid is that correct
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
also yes because of the if you're
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
looking to be having new entrants as a
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
possibility encourages everybody to
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
sharpen their pencil and what they're
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
going to offer and how they're going to
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
work with us
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know when you can't
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
recover your investment there's a lot of
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
time that a new entrant has to spend in
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
terms of developing you know a contract
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
with you know thousands of providers and
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
you know setting up the systems and
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
hiring people that if you're you know if
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
you don't have some reasonable a period
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
of time and there was always a risk
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
wreck because of the legislature could
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
come in and do something different but I
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
think reasonably you know the the
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that uh is passed I
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
think generally would be I think a
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
strong enough signal to to get people to
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
be interested in it and I you know have
 
00:53:01.319 --> 00:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
be interested in it and I you know have
had

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
um other than those that are in the
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
entrance that are in the market today
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
who have expressed interest at least
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
exploring what the opportunity might be
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
oh one of the things we I heard anyways
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing on Wednesday
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
and it goes back to the two year five
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
year six years and so forth and I
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
totally understand where you're coming
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
from because
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
you'd be looking for a new entrance into
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
the marketplace to put pressure on the
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
ones that are existing is it's a way to
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
do it is how the free market works
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
however there's a concern also that if
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
we go for five years that we don't have
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
a legislative review or
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
until five or six years after it's
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
passed is there any way to build into
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
the commission that was being created
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
through SB 263
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
benchmarks that if they don't hit
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
certain benchmarks it would require a
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
legislative review at that point in time
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of a compromise saying it's
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
not going to be stripping six years
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
before the legislative body reviews it
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
again but there's some Assurance within
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
the process that there is the ability to
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
put metrics in place to ensure we're
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
hitting some sort of metrics either
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
Financial patient satisfaction whatever
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
I do think that in terms of the the
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission structure that was another
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
thing that I think when Senator Bradley
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
testified originally to the committee on
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
when he introduced the bill to to your
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
community uh chairman McDonald he there
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
was a question about would there be some
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
tweaks to the I don't remember
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
specifically what they were to the the
 
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.790 align:start position:0%
specifically what they were to the the
commission

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a place where you know
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
you want a higher level of scrutiny as
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's going along I think one of the
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
arguments that I heard was that you know
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
if you do
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the permanency then people just don't
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
pay attention to it and if you do five
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
years that's five years when they'll pay
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
attention to it or six years it'll be
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
six years when they pay attention to it
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think if if the commission is staffed
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
or appointed with the right people that
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's I think probably the best thing
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
um other things in terms of making sure
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
that it's the program's working you know
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
balancing the the benefits that people
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
are receiving and the health outcomes
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
and and how the rest of the insurance
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
Market's working because today I think
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know I've tried to in various venues
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
is that you know New Hampshire's got the
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
number one highest employer sponsored
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
insurance which is you know a function I
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
think of two things one that the the
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
marketplace is available to help people
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
who aren't necessarily you know they're
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
small pool so that a difficult risk to
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
underwrite and in that market with the
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
1332 waiver we've got the lowest
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
Benchmark premium in the country on the
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid side we've got a pool of
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
individuals that have tend to have more
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
complex needs and by having three
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
structured pools you know that's
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
probably an oversimplification you know
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
our markets in terms of you want
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
employers to offer Insurance you want
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
the marketplace to be you know
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I put reasonable in the
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
air quotes because Health Care is not
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable no matter what you price it
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
up and then you know you've got the
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program which you know I think
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're running at a at a pretty efficient
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
rate overall in terms of our cost per
 
00:56:31.319 --> 00:56:35.089 align:start position:0%
rate overall in terms of our cost per
person

00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
you do realize when you go Federal we
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
will still be your oversight committee
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
enjoy that thank you so much thank you
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much see you next month
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
um update from our last or site meeting
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
last month on the retained House Bill
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
608 as far as the developmental Services
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
redesign implementation project
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
what I handed out is just an update from
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
last month to current as to kind of what
 
00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:46.089 align:start position:0%
last month to current as to kind of what
our

00:57:46.089 --> 00:57:46.099 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
involvement has been with stakeholders
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
with families with some advocacy groups
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
as far as talking about the redesign
 
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.790 align:start position:0%
as far as talking about the redesign
process

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.450 align:start position:0%
process
um

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:59.049 --> 00:57:59.059 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608 particularly talked about
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
piloting some of the services which
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
we're still planning to do however we
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
have not started that process as we're
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
still working towards compliance for our
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan on seven one of
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
this year so
 
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:18.020 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to take any questions or
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
feedback if you would like different or
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
more information about 608 and this well
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
first of all the chair would like to
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you because we've had some
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
conversations about how I gave myself a
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
good talk that I haven't talked with
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
either my Downstream staff or the people
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
who come to us for care and in doing
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
that I shared that with you and I want
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
to thank you for what I've been hearing
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
and with my ear to the ground and spot
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
checking we're getting there we're going
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
to do more I know that and thank you for
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
the progress thank you
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh yes sir I I
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
have several questions just about
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
reporting methodology and and formats
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
and some of them are kind of in the
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
weeds I I can either take them offline
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
or ask about four or five questions in
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
public which whatever you prefer I would
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
prefer to let people with the single
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
question and one follow-up go first and
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
then um all right we'll go back to you
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you very much
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I missed the last couple meetings so
 
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
I've missed the updates but I do know
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
that there are some significant level of
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
concern among families in the
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
developmental Services communities they
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't feel that they're necessarily
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
being listened to by the department so I
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
just want to lay that out there again
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
because there there is a concern and I
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
guess my specific
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
question on this is
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
I still don't understand how
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
the department can save money
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
and deliver the same level and quality
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
of services
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
in these programs particularly As We
 
01:00:14.099 --> 01:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
in these programs particularly As We
Know

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
Know
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
costs are going up wages are increasing
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
so so I'm still
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%
confused myself sure thank you thank you
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
for that comment I I don't think the
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
department takes the stance that this is
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
a cost savings for the this program
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
um what we have had is you know
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
um no historical methodology and
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
developing rates for services that kept
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
up with inflation that kept up with the
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
costs of doing service so part of the
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
whole redesign is to look at the costs
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
and what are we reimbursing as far as
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so unless this is a different
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
proposal but it was the marsal
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
report I'm referring to Alvarez and
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
Marcel there was projected to be a
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
cost-saving of something like 40 million
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
dollars so has the department walked
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
away from the notion that there will be
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
cost savings I I would have to look back
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
at what the what the a m report had said
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
about cost savings I'm not sure it was
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
I see Chris coming up here as far as the
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
sorry about that Chris Antonello
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner the Alvarez and
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
Marcels report came in two phases the
 
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:48.059 align:start position:0%
first phase looked at that 40 million
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
dollar savings and that was really
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
related to wait list
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
last year the other
 
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.030 align:start position:0%
last year the other
savings

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
savings
 
01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:58.460 align:start position:0%
that's where the savings were then the
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
Alvarez Alvarez and Marcel a m report
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
looked at better ways to utilize funding
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
and matching service needs with rates
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
with budgets and that's some of the work
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing in the next year around the
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you and so I recall that report
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
though phase two had three two or three
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
different tiers of service people were
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
going to be put into one tier or another
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I think there were cost savings
 
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.270 align:start position:0%
and I think there were cost savings
projections

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
there as well and that's the part that
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
was concerning to the totally
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
understands and so that piece
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
potentially and we actually put the
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
tiered waiver work on hold because of
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
all the concerns we heard from families
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
and so what this department will be
 
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.150 align:start position:0%
and so what this department will be
doing

01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the fall winter is look at okay what
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
services and they're started some of
 
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
that work do we need to have where do we
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
need to have it um is it in the DD
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
waiver is it in a different waiver so
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
that was put on hold
 
01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:17.450 align:start position:0%
that was put on hold
on yeah

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald and I both raised the
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
question of stakeholders being listened
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
to more we raised it in different ways
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
but it was the same point could you take
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
a minute or two and and just give a
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
little oversight about what you've got
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
planned in the next few months with both
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
the area agency leaders and with
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
individual stakeholders sure so one of
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
the upcoming series that we're doing is
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
just a brief snippet online for families
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
using our communication committee and
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
then we will be going back kind of on
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
our road show again for individuals and
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
families to have some face-to-face
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
meetings with them to talk about their
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and you know really wanting to
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
hear from them directly as individuals
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
and families utilizing Services what
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
their concerns are so we also as I think
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
as you know representative Pearson we
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
have a newsletter that should be going
 
01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:20.420 align:start position:0%
out I believe
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of days that
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
we've been doing quarterly yeah and
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
you're you're all I think you're on the
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
list right
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
um to receive it so with area agencies
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
we've been meeting uh weekly with csni
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
which is their Trade Organization myself
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
and Associate commissioner Chris
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
Antonello have been meeting with them
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
weekly and really trying to collaborate
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
on on a plan and where some of our pinch
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
points may be so we have been doing that
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
just just a thought in that I bring
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
my work as chairman of the New Hampshire
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
commission for the deaf and hard of
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
hearing we've got three different groups
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
out there that are advocacy groups for
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
the same population
 
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:08.540 align:start position:0%
like you do
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
and I find it's very very helpful
 
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
and I find it's very very helpful
sometimes

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
to work with and through those groups
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
and sometimes not
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
and that way should there be the
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
hypothetical of any particular advocacy
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
group wanting too much to guard the door
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
I have a way to speak to
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard of hearing individuals and
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
their caregivers and loved ones that
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
both take into account the strengths of
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
the advocacy groups and also the
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and it's just free advice
 
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.530 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and it's just free advice
um

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we welcome any invitation
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
from any of the advocacy groups we've
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
met with a couple this past month as far
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
as we were welcomed into their meetings
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
to kind of do a q a and have that
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
one-on-one time with the department so
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
we met with the able Group which is an
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
advocacy group we also met with New
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire disability voice and choice
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
who has a different
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
um kind of take on the whole system's
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
work so we're we're open and willing to
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
talk to whoever you know wants to talk
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
to us and if we can reach out to anybody
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
that you know you're hearing from or
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
have concerns from where we're
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely willing to do that how are
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
you getting more names for your
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
newsletter mailing list more names of
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
individuals out there sure I think what
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
as we're doing more stakeholder
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
engagement and provider education I
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
would say we're pretty flooded with can
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
you add me to your mailing list
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
um which is good because we want to be
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
able to streamline our communication in
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
a quick way
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
um to everybody so we I think certainly
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
our efforts have been helping maintain
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
and build that list I found in the deaf
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
and hard of hearing community that some
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
of those names came forward from
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
and then I started calling audiologists
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
individually and said I can't ask you to
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
do a HIPAA violation but I can ask you
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
to type this out and give it to every
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
one of your patients that if you want to
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
be on our mailing list you can be and so
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
you have to contact us so therefore no
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
HIPAA rule violation but it does reach
 
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
out into the community more fully great
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
you probably already know that but I
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I think I figured that out
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
a few years ago any other questions
 
01:07:40.329 --> 01:07:40.339 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I actually have
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
two questions one's a clarifying
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
a question the other one's an inquiry on
 
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.849 align:start position:0%
a question the other one's an inquiry on
the

01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
charts that we handed out there is the
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
pie charts and there's also bar charts
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I've noticed that on the bar chart
 
01:07:59.329 --> 01:07:59.339 align:start position:0%
there's no delay the back clock if you
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
will however when I look on the pie
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
chart here's the orange and the blue and
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
the orange indicates that people that
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't have service that are waiting so
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to pull together why the pie
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
chart has the two orange and blue but on
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
the bar chart there's nothing showing a
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
delight sure and I think that's our our
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
next topic but
 
01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.669 align:start position:0%
next topic but
um

01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
so for the bar chart that is the funding
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
waiting list so people who have
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
requested funding have received funding
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
and then the pie charts talk about the
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
service delivery
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
um that they're actually receiving so we
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a waitlist for funding people
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
for services but because of mostly
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
Workforce which you'll see on the pie
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
chart they're waiting to receive
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
services but not due to a funding issue
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for the verification the
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
inquiry yes the inquiry question is
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
along this journey we talked about some
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
sort of software implementation and
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
trying to make the changes along that
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
Journey can you provide an update of
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
where are we with that software update
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
as far as how are we in a process of
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
implementing it are we still exploring
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
it where are we in regards to that
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
software sure we're we are very excited
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
about the software I'm not a software
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
person but
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
um certainly it'll be an upgrade from
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
um it is in a few phases so the first
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
phase uh will be turned on
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
um on seven one I believe
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
um as far as automating some of the
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
processes that our department and the
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
area agencies and providers do manually
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's via email via fax so we're
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
we're certainly excited about that and
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
then moving into the future getting
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
things like our prior authorizations
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
automated which again will get money out
 
01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
um is the enthusiasm of the software
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
update shared with the stakeholders as
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.709 align:start position:0%
update shared with the stakeholders as
well

01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
they haven't
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
I I I don't want to speak for them but
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
they haven't said uh that they're not
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
excited about it they're probably not as
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
excited as we are however
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know I think anything that
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
automates a process and makes services
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
and and money flow out quicker I think
 
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
is a really beneficial for individuals
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
I issued a press release when the deaf
 
01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
and hard of hearing committee through my
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
predecessor and my people on the
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee issued a handy motorists card
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
I got a press release out to everybody
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
and local police departments were so
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
inundated with requests can I have one
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
of those cards that we had to go to a
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
second printing privately funded and so
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is get everybody excited
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
write a wonderful press release coming
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
to a DD community near you is ta-da the
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
new software and here's why this is so
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
important and all newspapers please
 
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
important and all newspapers please
print

01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
print
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
you gotta you got to get out there thank
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
of McDonald
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
my last name is not Edwards thank you
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
sir yeah no not not that I would mind if
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
it were
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
just to clarify on the pie charts uh the
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
in-home supports and the acquired brain
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
disorder talks about individuals
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
projected to start Services by March
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
31st I'm assuming that should be 2023
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
not 2022.
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct thank you just want
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure I wasn't a year behind or
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
and now
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
as promised
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards why don't you
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
take 10 minutes without asking me to let
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
you go another 30 seconds so you've got
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
it all right thank you I actually had
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
one item that I wanted to mention
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
um sort of before diving into this uh
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
and that is that I've had uh the the
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
pleasure of uh visiting uh uh Miss Santa
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
nella's office with Miss Hardy they were
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
very courteous they offered me lots of
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
chocolates so I I want to go back
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
sometime and visit some more uh they're
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
they're over in the the campus over
 
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.729 align:start position:0%
they're over in the the campus over
there

01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:25.739 --> 01:12:27.110 align:start position:0%
there
um so

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
um but but one of the takeaways and and
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
I had to flee the building for another
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
meeting so we didn't quite finish up and
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I've had some time to think
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
about it we the the one of the things
 
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:43.340 align:start position:0%
that uh I've observed is a very specific
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh client communication an issue that
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
the bds's experiencing and it's related
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
very to a very specific topic about
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not a a parent can take their
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
DD child into a recreational facility
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
and what and when they do what gets re
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
what's reimbursable and what's not and
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I I understand that the CMS
 
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
guidelines are pretty clear that the
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
price of admission is not covered but if
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's uh extra costs associated with
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
an escort of some kind that that sort of
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental cost to make the experience
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
possible is reimbursable so so having
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
been an old army comptroller uh I I
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
understood sort of the branch conditions
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
on this but but then when I continue to
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
hear from the individuals and I continue
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
to hear from
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
certain members of cisney not the whole
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
seasoning but aspects assisting and then
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
continue to hear from the Senator's
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
office it just seemed to me like this is
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
such a simple small thing that's
 
01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:06.020 align:start position:0%
exploded into just a communication
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
tornado of some kind I don't I don't
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
understand I I I would like it I would
 
01:14:16.729 --> 01:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you could
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
provide me specifically in the CMS
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
guidelines you know page chapter line
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
item this yellow highlighted exactly
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
what the department is
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
um citing as the official Point of
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
Departure for your decision because the
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
community seems to think that you're
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
operating in an area of discretion and
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I picked up that you're operating
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
from an area of of direct guidance or
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
limitation and so the distinction
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
between doing what you're told in the
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
words of the CMS guidelines and whether
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
or not you have discretion is really
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
captured in the write-up from CMS so if
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
you could bring my attention to that
 
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:10.940 align:start position:0%
that would at least help me understand
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
not just the specific issue but the
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
bigger context which is why are we
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
having so so much trouble
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
communicating with the with the public
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
or the public hearing it and I I don't
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
mean to bash you because I I see I see
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
your document where you've got all the
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
meetings you're going to the dates that
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
you went to I have absolutely no doubt
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
that you guys are trying I'm just trying
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
to understand how it can maintain such a
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
huge disconnect with all of the efforts
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
the good efforts that you all are making
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and so if I could just take a look
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
at this one residential or excuse me
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
recreational issue that would help me
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
understand maybe you know what the
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
Genesis of these points of contention
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
are so
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
and so I I just as a follow-up we met
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
with some of these families that you're
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning actually this week about
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
their concerns with the recreational
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
coverage we also reached out to
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
um our our national organization that
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
liaises with CMS about additional
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
guidance so we can certainly provide
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
that to you
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
all right thanks and and sort of the
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
break point is
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
are you following a mandatory guideline
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
or are you following are you
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
interpreting it in a way in which you
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
have discretion and you're choosing to
 
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
go the other ways that we don't have to
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
answer that today but that's kind of
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
where I want to end up because one or a
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
zero at this point do area agencies have
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
discretion within themselves so one Area
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
Agency may do it one way and another a
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
different way
 
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
I I think that has been a historical
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
practice where they have had discretion
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
however when we have asked CMS directly
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
for that guidance
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's what we're following now
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
is their guidance that things such as a
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
recreational pass are not covered by the
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
waiver however things that like you said
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards if somebody needs
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
a direct support professional or
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from said activity
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
those those are the types of things that
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
are covered so because this has been
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
brought up we've directly gone to CMS
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
that have been following their
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us but we can provide
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
you with that detail I understand that
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
you have to give your area agencies uh
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
some flexibility yeah but when I get a
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
phone call from somebody saying this
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
wasn't covered but my cousin has a DD
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
person in a different part of the state
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
and it was I I don't have the answer and
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
if the answer is different area agencies
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
have different discretion at this time
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
before you make them do it all in a
 
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
uniform way that's a bit of information
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
that can be communicated as well because
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
I I had no answer to them sure I also
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that certain area agencies have
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
other types of dollars that they can use
 
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
to pay for some of these activities that
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
are not covered under the waiver so they
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
have family support Council dollars they
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
have fundraising dollars they have
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
Community Partnerships that they can
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
utilize too so I think that's where we
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
see some of the differences between the
 
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
area agencies again communication
 
01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.370 align:start position:0%
area agencies again communication
foreign

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't want I don't want to leave
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
that topic making it sound or feel like
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm picking on you all or beating up
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
on you it's just an entire it's an
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
extremely complex area where you have
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
thousands of clients every one of your
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
clients is deeply emotionally engaged in
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
the problems that they're trying to
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
address and and you're sort of stuck in
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
the role in a way of having to be the
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
well-managed bureaucrats that are sort
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
of out of sync with the emotional aspect
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
of what they're what your clients are
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with so it's inherently tough so
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
I um
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to talk about the the format
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the reporting if I may now Mr chair
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay so we representative Merchant you
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
put your finger right on something big
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about for
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
probably nine months or longer and that
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
is uh on the last document that shows
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
that there is no wait list this is
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
because this is what's been getting
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
reported to us is that we have fully
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
funded the wait list that's our legal
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
obligation and but that never got to the
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
questions that are answered by the pie
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
chart and so these pie charts these are
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
the first times I think we've seen these
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
pie charts right I think we've provided
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
them last last time but um yes we're
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
this is something we would like to do
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
ongoing if it's information you find
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
valuable oh okay so this is the
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
distinction between Our budgetary
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
obligation and what's really happening
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
out in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
what we really care about I think is you
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
know that we we know what's really going
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
on and so you've got on the first chart
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
um you've got 677 individuals and and it
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
just makes me curious how many did we
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
fund for you don't have to answer that
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
right now I'm just I'm just going
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
through some of the questions that that
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
get triggered when I look at your your
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
data and so uh so obviously we funded
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
for all of them it's probably a number
 
01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:38.219 align:start position:0%
that's different than 677 though so so
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting to know how much
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
we funded for how many are actually
 
01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:44.780 align:start position:0%
coming to our doors to asking for help
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
and then how many of those are we're
 
01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
just not able to help
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
and your top delay reasons you have
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
securing a vendor agency 28 of those in
 
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
that unserved category are having what
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
what does that mean they they there
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's not one of the 10 area agencies
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are working with them or why is
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah not
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
curing a vendor to provide the services
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
that are being requested
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay so so maybe I'm misinterpreting the
 
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
use of the word agency there that the
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
agency is having trouble finding a
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
provider correct is that a would be a
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
better way to say that bullet or am I
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
just misinterpreting it still
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
so this is a good distinction vendor
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
agency meaning the area agency cannot
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
find the vendor agency once they find an
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
agency if the agency says we're having
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty hiring staff that's the 47
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
number above the 28 so the majority of
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
people are not starting or have a delay
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
because there's inability to identify
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
staff right and there is a provider
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
agency selected right that agency is
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
having difficulty the 28 is there are no
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
agencies responding
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I guess I just need to
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
learn the bullet then because you just
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
told me the board agency is being used
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
in two different ways Area Agency and
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
the next level yeah and remember who
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with simple legislators
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know you gotta the kiss principle
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
right keep it simple for the stupid bit
 
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.310 align:start position:0%
right keep it simple for the stupid bit
um

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
all right continue and then
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh I think what this implies then is
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
this these are all snapshots at a given
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
time and that there's going to be Trend
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
data provided so that so that we can see
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
some of these things over time like uh
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know if we we we want to know if the
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem's getting better or worse and
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
and that's what the trend lines would be
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
but uh I when I first saw these last
 
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:03.380 align:start position:0%
night I I was very excited because I was
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
uh this is just something I think we've
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
always needed and I appreciate it uh how
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
how tough is it to get this data
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
is this is this a hard report to produce
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
once you get started is it easy to keep
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
up with the data or is this a pain in
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
the neck every single month well I think
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
going back to the the previous question
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
about the I.T system currently this is
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
all gathered
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
um by hand uh with our department
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
working with the area agencies to
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
collect that information with I.T system
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
as it comes online this should be more
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
of an automated process where we will
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
know and be able to pull reports from
 
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
New Heights to get this information but
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
as of right now it's a manual pull on
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
the BDS team but also on the area agency
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
team reporting that data out to us so
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
say again when you think you're going to
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
go live on your it system
 
01:23:58.739 --> 01:24:04.669 align:start position:0%
go live on your it system
um

01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
up and running so while you're doing
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
this in the manual phase what's a
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh workload to put on you
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
once a month once every quarter what's
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
what's the right timeline given the
 
01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.209 align:start position:0%
what's the right timeline given the
Manpower

01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
Manpower
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think we've I think what we've been
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
doing is a quarter we've been keeping up
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
with it quarterly and I think that's
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
pretty doable I think monthly would be a
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
burden for the not only for the
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
department but for the area agencies all
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
right that's it for me
 
01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
the representative yields back the rest
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
of his time Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
I just have
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
one question do you get claims data
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
on these Services through the mmis
 
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.550 align:start position:0%
on these Services through the mmis
system

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
we can we can capture claims data
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
through mmis one of the challenges is
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
when there's a prior authorization or
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
also known as a PA that may or may not
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
be billed out so it would be nice to
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
have a snapshot of what services have
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
been utilized
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
but without knowing what's been billed
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
out the claims data is just going to
 
01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
tell us what's been built
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
so we have to know what's been allocated
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
and then what's been billed and then
 
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:25.940 align:start position:0%
that will tell us our utilization
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you basically cash versus accrual
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant if I could
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman well in
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
the representative Edwards
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
I think I heard the fact that the pie
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
charts are something you're doing
 
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
charts are something you're doing
periodically

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
and yes so we're doing it probably will
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
be on a quarterly basis yes is there a
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
way to take the pie charts like you did
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
with a bar chart and map it over a trend
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
line sure thank you we're not seeing the
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
needle move I mean the 30 to 20 number
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
of people not receiving Services seems
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
to be pretty consistent but we can
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
certainly show that Trend in our next
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present to the committee
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
I know in the Medical Counseling massage
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
organization of which I'm part-time CEO
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
we are now helping people with their
 
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
tuitions as they are in school in
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
exchange for working for us in order to
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
help the area agencies find more
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
providers of various types is this
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
something that is doable something
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're thinking true working with the
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
area agencies where are the people you
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
need that where are the gaps where are
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
the holes where are the schools where
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
are the people out there who aren't
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
applying to the school because they
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the money but if suddenly
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
they discovered an area agency might
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
prevent some money for them maybe not
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
having to be paid back maybe over a
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
period but you got to work first for so
 
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
many we just heard about that uh well
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
last time with dental students and maybe
 
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
this is something that might work for
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
you folks too
 
01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say that the
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
corollary to that and I can't remember
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
whether I heard it here or somewhere
 
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.810 align:start position:0%
whether I heard it here or somewhere
else

01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
is that if you're doing one of these
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
programs where you get somebody uh you
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
help with tuition so that they can
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
come to work for you uh it's it's
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
actually one of the things that seems to
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
work really efficiently is they take out
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
the student loans and then each
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
period that the student loan comes do
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
you pay the student loan or whatever
 
01:27:56.290 --> 01:27:56.300 align:start position:0%
percentage of it you've agreed to pay
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is that if you
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
structure it that way you have not paid
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
the tuition up front right uh and had
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
somebody go Waltzing off or or really be
 
01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
willing to pay it back but then they
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
have a catastrophic illness or something
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
but you also have uh the incentive for
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
somebody to stay
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
and neither side is going to lose out
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
financially either because they didn't
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
complete the length of time or because
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
you said you were going to pay for them
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
and you didn't
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and and it just is is a nice seems to
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
me to be a sensible Arrangement so I put
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
it Forward whenever this question comes
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
up and I'm taking this to my board of
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
directors that's brilliant thank you so
 
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.450 align:start position:0%
directors that's brilliant thank you so
much

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
and representatives say hi to the
 
01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
Richard now recognizes Michael Holt from
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug monitoring program
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
to present the annual report
 
01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
you know the first requirement of
 
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
testifying here don't you
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
Miss myself that's the second one
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%

you turned on the mic and you smiled now
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
I got that I got that in from you
 
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
you may go go ahead I'm just gonna thank
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
everybody my name is Michael Holt I'm
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
the section administrator for the
 
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services and I
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
oversee the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
program and the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
program okay that was my question
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
so it's the prescription drug and the
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
non-prescription drug
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's correct I apologize for that
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today to present the state
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 annual report for the
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
pdmp uh it's a report required by
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
Statute required to be presented to this
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh this body uh and it contains data for
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2022 so that's means
 
01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
July 2021 through June 2022 so the data
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
is a bit uh it's old on the on the older
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
side my presentation will present
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
information from this reporting period
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
and also updates from the uh the current
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh State fiscal year
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
um as you all know 2022 was a year of
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
transition for the pdmp it was
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
transferred via House Bill 2 from oplc
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
to DHHS uh PDP staff was transferred as
 
01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:52.250 align:start position:0%
to DHHS uh PDP staff was transferred as
well

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
um at that time the other program
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
administrator position had been vacant
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
for almost a year from Spring 21 to
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
Spring 22. we filled the program
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
administrator position in April 22 Sean
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
Jackson is sitting behind us he'll
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
um he served a full year and has been
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
recently promoted and uh the position is
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
vacant once again we're trying to
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
recruit for that
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
um other than the agency transfer
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
um another the other significant change
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
in 2022 was the passage of Senate Bill
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
45 which allowed this was a long-term
 
01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
goal of the pdmp and the bill permitted
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
the integration of pdmp data into New
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire practitioners electronic
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
health record-keeping systems basically
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
integrating pdmp data into the clinical
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
workflow into the ehrs
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
um into
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes I'll tell you all about that right
 
01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:51.950 align:start position:0%
yes I'll tell you all about that right
now

01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
um it's uh the value is that it becomes
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
part of the clinical workflow there's no
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
delay on practitioners don't need to go
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
outside into another web-based server uh
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
to access a separate web-based platform
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
to acquire the pdmp when they're seeing
 
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.689 align:start position:0%
to acquire the pdmp when they're seeing
patients

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:32:08.699 --> 01:32:09.890 align:start position:0%
patients
um

01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
it makes access to PDP data more
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
efficient promotes compliance with state
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
state laws for mandatory use and
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
contributes to clinical outcomes
 
01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.649 align:start position:0%
contributes to clinical outcomes
um

01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.659 --> 01:32:25.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
so another another Milestone
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
um in January 2022 we entered a new
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
state contract with uh bamboo Health the
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
software company that provides the pdmp
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
data system for New Hampshire
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
um the contract includes multiple
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
enhancements to the pdmp including
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
direct support for pdmp integration
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the integration product is called PMP
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
Gateway we launched it in March 2022 and
 
01:32:54.729 --> 01:32:54.739 align:start position:0%
if you go to slide 12
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
shows that in the first three months of
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
implementation the number of pdmp
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
queries increased dramatically by 36
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
percent and uh and has continued to
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
increase so the goal of the goal of
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
increased utilization through EHR
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
integration of pdmp data uh is has been
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
has been borne out
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
um dramatically
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
um we are using Federal CDC funds to
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
fully fund
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the first two years of Gateway
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
integration through January 2024 for any
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
health care entity in the state that
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
wants to integrate
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh despite active marketing Outreach and
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
partnership with the New Hampshire
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association uptake of the
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
service has been surprisingly slower
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
than expected with only a 15 penetration
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
rate for prescribers in the state
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we continue to Market uh we continue
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
to do Outreach and we continue to
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
partner with the hospital Association
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the reasons may be the
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
technological you know work uh in
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
integration uh using
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the system uh the hospital Healthcare
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
entities existing EHR vendors others
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
might be simply
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
well once the funding runs out we're
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay for it ourselves so
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
best not to give or um our our
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
prescribers what they want for fear of
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
having to pay for it at the end of the
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
funding period so again this is ongoing
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
work for us
 
01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
um and um to uh to increase uptake uh
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
Market the value of this and do Outreach
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
to Providers uh individually to to push
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
their uh their their health care
 
01:34:39.239 --> 01:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
their uh their their health care
entities

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
um to adopt this uh this excellent
 
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:44.689 align:start position:0%
um to adopt this uh this excellent
service

01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
um another significant enhancement that
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
we launched in 2022
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
um as a software product called narx
 
01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
um as a software product called narx
care

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
um you can uh this enhancement is decide
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
on just described on slides eight
 
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
through ten
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um narx care is a it provides enhanced
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
patient prescription history reporting
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
for prescribers including risk scores
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
proprietary risk scores that are
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
developed by our vendor interactive data
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
visualizations and a Communications
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
module where prescribers can communicate
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
with one another through the system
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and the feedback that we've gotten
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
from the new visualizations and tools
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the pdmp is still dealing with
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
another significant statutory change
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
resulting from House Bill 2
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we're on our way to fixing it
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
um but remember that uh House Bill 2
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
changed the confidentiality standard
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
um applicable to the release of pdmp
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
data the law sites what is known as the
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
HIPAA Safe Harbor standard and in part
 
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
this means that all location data
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
smaller than the entire State need to be
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
removed from any aggregate data released
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
including city and county the only
 
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
exception to this would be as an
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
allowance to use the first three digits
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
of a zip code this is called zip three
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
and so last year's annual report and
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
this year's annual report present all
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
location data in terms of um not County
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
data but in terms of zip 3 data let me
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
interrupt you to say that there are wide
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
swaths of the state and swaths of the
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
state that are not wide but still have a
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people in them but there's one
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
who's done bulk mails all his adult life
 
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
I know we have uh I'd probably say 033
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe 031 who are narrower and if
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't worry if I get the numbers wrong
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
but there are certain first three zip
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
codes that population wise are are quite
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
narrow do you think that is posing any
 
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
narrow do you think that is posing any
problem

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh well the zip 3 standard that were
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
that were on using the past two years is
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
problematic because it creates
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies for historical data
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
um you know I mean if you look at page
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at page four of the
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
report you can see the zip3 map overlaid
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
on counties and and they don't match up
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
so you know this is the same issue that
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
we ran into last year where we um we're
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're presenting locational data you
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
know that we presented for the past you
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
know five or six or eight years but it
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's not consistent with previous data
 
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
it also creates barriers for
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
um other uh entities and other partners
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
to use county level prescription data
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
from the pdmp so it's been about been a
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
couple years of not being able to
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
actively use our data in in the most
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
efficient way however the good news is
 
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.550 align:start position:0%
efficient way however the good news is
that

01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
um to fix this unintended consequence we
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
have HHS requested legislation
 
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
um this session to allow the pdmp to
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
release data by County
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
um as an exception to the safe harbor
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
standard I want to thank Senator gray
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
for sponsoring that legislation
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
um it's Senate bills 34 it is past the
 
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.709 align:start position:0%
um it's Senate bills 34 it is past the
Senate

01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and recently passed um got an OTP
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation from uh representative
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
McDonald's committee
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
um HHS and EA so if it all goes well uh
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
starting fiscal year 24 we'll be able to
 
01:38:07.139 --> 01:38:09.169 align:start position:0%
starting fiscal year 24 we'll be able to
release

01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
release
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
county level data once again so we're
 
01:38:15.850 --> 01:38:15.860 align:start position:0%
looking forward to that thank you
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
chair and uh it's good seeing you again
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
Mr hole I had wondered what happened to
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
you after you uh you moved off our
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
marijuana Plantation on the Cannabis
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Care you'll see me in a couple
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
weeks reporting some cannabis
 
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
information for you so
 
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I I this is a very thick thorough
 
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
report and it feels to me like it buries
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the lead a little bit and I'll just tell
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
you how how I'm I'm looking at the
 
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
report and I'm wondering if the format
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
next year may want to be tweaked a
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
little bit there's a lot of great
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation but it seems
 
01:39:01.850 --> 01:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
like page five at the bottom of page
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
five the prescription prescribing Trends
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
is is is maybe the headline and it and
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
it gets buried a little but you know
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
because what we're trying to figure out
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
is do we have a increasing or potential
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
problem in the future or are we getting
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
something mitigated we've worried a bit
 
01:39:21.490 --> 01:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
about in the past so so this this
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
prescribing Trends which seems to want
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
to be a major element and then when you
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
look at the stimulates and it says it's
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
being increased you go flip to the
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
stimulants pages on pages like 32 and
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
Beyond and it it provides some data but
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't offer any explanations of why
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
this trend may be occurring it's just
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
documenting the fact that the trend
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
exists and I wish Dr Murphy were still
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
here because he may have some clinical
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
Insight but in without having a
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
clinician available
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
um it just it begs the question in my
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
mind is why are we seeing an uptick in
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
stimulants and it's predominantly all
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
the young people and not us old people I
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
guess we can't be stimulated anymore but
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh but in any case I I I think it's a
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
really thorough report and it's mandated
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
by law but it it could be a little bit
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
more useful in terms of highlighting
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
what we really need to know about does
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have a problem and and why
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
might we have a problem
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the feedback I'm happy
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
to take that back and make some
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
improvements in terms of structure one
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
man's opinion
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I mean with that introduction I'm
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
happy to run through uh some of the uh
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
the report itself highlighting some of
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
the data
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um as representative Edwards uh States
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
the the if you go to page five it
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
introduces some of the you know the high
 
01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
introduces some of the you know the high
level

01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
um high-level Trends uh for Staples
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
skier 2022
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
um registering counts have increased by
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
8.4 percent
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
um our five-year look back has uh shows
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
an increase of uh a 58 registrant
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
accounts since 2018.
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
um 2022 we had patient queries performed
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
by practitioners uh increased by 14
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of that is attributable to
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
um to the Gateway integration that was
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
successfully implemented uh the spring
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and um yeah if you want to um page
 
01:41:36.729 --> 01:41:36.739 align:start position:0%
five has a
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
States what various drug categories have
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
either drawn up or gone down but I'd
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
urge you to turn to page 14 again buried
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
deep in the report representative
 
01:41:46.679 --> 01:41:48.109 align:start position:0%
deep in the report representative
Edwards

01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:51.860 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
so the slide on the slide on page 1415
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
are are um illustrative
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
um slide 14 talks about field
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
prescription counts shows a two-year
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
period from staple school year 21 and
 
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.370 align:start position:0%
period from staple school year 21 and
22.

01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
22.
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
um opioid prescription counts down by
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
eight percent stimulant prescription
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
counts increased by 22 percent uh and
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
sedative prescription counts uh
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
decreased by five
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
um page 15 shows a five-year look back
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
which shows more dramatic increases and
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
decreases opioids down 23 percent over
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
this five-year period from 2018 to
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
present stimulants up 31 sedatives down
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
by eight
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
um not shown on the graph is a total
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
control substance prescriptions over the
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
five-year period have gone down four
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
percent on the state of uh in the state
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
um the slides that follow starting on
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
page 16 we have a we have an opioid
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
series of slides
 
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
um we see the decrease in opioid
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions consistent not only across
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
prescription counts but also by day
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
supply and potency uh like I said there
 
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
are some location based slides as well
 
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
but it's not particularly meaningful to
 
01:43:09.729 --> 01:43:09.739 align:start position:0%
say that zip 3 region
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
035036 saw the largest decrease
 
01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.290 align:start position:0%
035036 saw the largest decrease
um

01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
slide 24 I'd like to highlight want to
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
turn to that page
 
01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.330 align:start position:0%
turn to that page
um

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year 2022 8.4 percent
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
of all New Hampshire residents had at
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
least one filled opioid prescription uh
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
again this is down from uh from from the
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
01:43:36.239 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
previous year
um

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
the largest percentage uh being in the
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
60 and older age range which is
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
understandable due to uh
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
I would absolutely say that also I'd
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
also legislative efforts to you know to
 
01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.850 align:start position:0%
also legislative efforts to you know to
to regulate

01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
to regulate
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
um the prescription opioid prescription
 
01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
patterns are
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
key representative representative Weber
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hearing representative Nagel's
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
voice in my ear but uh this also stems
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
from my own life experience
 
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:21.530 align:start position:0%
from my own life experience
um

01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
I was I was looking at the day's supply
 
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
of opioid prescriptions and that's
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the aggregate but I'm I'm
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
remembering a time when I was caring for
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
my late husband who had metastatic bone
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
disease and
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering I'm just putting out
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
there because I don't see
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
I read this as thoroughly as I should
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
have up till now but I will uh I want to
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
put in the plug that for
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh particularly for long-term cancer
 
01:44:57.609 --> 01:44:57.619 align:start position:0%
patients and other patients that need
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
opioid prescriptions for long-term pain
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
control and are being managed that way
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
and particularly for hospice care end of
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
life care that patients are getting
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
the medications that they need and the
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh number of days supply of pills that
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
they need to my late husband's
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
experience was that if he had one pill
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
there was a continuous application
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
say MSR MS Contin 30. he felt sick and
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
brain fogged all the time and he didn't
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
want to live like that if he was given a
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
larger supply of immediate release pills
 
01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:47.540 align:start position:0%
at the 15 milligram level
 
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
he was able to
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
pick and choose when he wanted to be
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
clearer and when he wanted more pain
 
01:46:00.850 --> 01:46:00.860 align:start position:0%
control and I hope that we are allowing
 
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
patients that kind of flexibility but
 
01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm worried that we aren't because his
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
experience was in the late 90s when they
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
were still being thrown around like
 
01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.290 align:start position:0%
were still being thrown around like
candy

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether that's
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
something you can comment on or not
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
because I realized that most of your
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
stuff is in the aggregate yeah it would
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
be difficult to comment on that
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
um prescriber uh prescribing patterns of
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
opiates are
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
um are really are related but are
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
outside the the scope of what the pdmp
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
does which is you know which is
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
essentially a clinical tool a database
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
for uh for providers to look into to
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
make sure there's not over prescribing
 
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
but what you're talking about is exactly
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
that with in terms of mme where um
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
milligram uh morphine milligram
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
equivalent which does combine all uh
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
opiates into uh into one standard
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
um and it's a it's a national standard
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we all states use to aggregate
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
presentation of data
 
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.830 align:start position:0%
presentation of data
um

01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:03.129 --> 01:47:03.139 align:start position:0%
one follow-up sure
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh do you
 
01:47:05.639 --> 01:47:06.910 align:start position:0%
uh do you
um

01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
slice the information that's currently
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
on on slide 18 which is the aggregate
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
number of days Supply that's out there
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh is there a way of determining the
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
number of days supply per individual
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
I mean it presumably would be just
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
dividing these numbers by the number of
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
prescriptions I'm I'm sure we could well
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I just I just thought it was
 
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
interesting that
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
being a liberal arts guy I can read it
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
read any sentence four ways and then
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
page 25
 
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
um with this big huge we write them as
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
another liberal arts graduate I write
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
them that way oh good thank you that's
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
why we communicated well
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
um page 25 it could mean the big jump of
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
21.3 percent under the zero to 19 year
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
olds is that these dentists with a
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
specialty are going opioid crazy or it
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
could mean that this is a new data
 
01:48:13.729 --> 01:48:13.739 align:start position:0%
category that is coming in or it could
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
mean several other things which is a
 
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
because it's dangerous if it's one and
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's completely understandable if it's
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:48:28.209 --> 01:48:28.219 align:start position:0%
and can you find out and let us know
 
01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
we can try to find out the cause I can
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
tell I can tell you like what the slide
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
says is that
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
um 50 of this increase is due to uh
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
prescriptions uh made by Oral Surgeons
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and so does that suggest that uh
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are more kids getting oral surgery
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
um better access to Dental Care uh we
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
has the category of these dentists been
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
part of the data all along no no so it's
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
a new it's an addition is it yeah so it
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the dentists are going up a
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
yard crazy it just means they're now
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
showing up in this particular place
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah the chair yes since
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
the data is 21 to 22.
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we've had the crisis and we probably
 
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
deferred a lot of elective procedures
 
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
it could be that in 20 we didn't have
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
the kids come in to get their oral
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
surgery and in 22 we brought them all in
 
01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.229 align:start position:0%
surgery and in 22 we brought them all in
and

01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
all those wisdom teeth
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
you had a backlog
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's entirely possible and and and
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
probably likely you do write good Pros
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
by the way any other questions
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious I should maybe know
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
exactly what the this commission or this
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
board does uh what its Charter is but
 
01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:55.699 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
explicitly charged with trying to find
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
out the underlying reason behind Trends
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
or are you meant to be more of a
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
methodology and data collection
 
01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.850 align:start position:0%
methodology and data collection
operation

01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:09.860 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
undercar and guidance the latter this is
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is a this is more of a a data uh
 
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.149 align:start position:0%
this is a this is more of a a data uh
repository

01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
repository
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and the issue that we have had with
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
pdmp data is that it is siled and the
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
um that we have had historically of
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
sharing that data on any in any way that
 
01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
is usable you know to those who might be
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
able to assess the data better
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
um has been a barrier
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
um similarly we're limited the amount of
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
data that we can take into the pdmp from
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
other areas you know like Medicaid and
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
so when I asked you earlier
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
why the use of stimulants have gone up
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if we now have a pending
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
problem that's outside the charter
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's outside the scope of your
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
organization to answer the why that
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
trend is happening we are limited in our
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
ability to make those assessments within
 
01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:09.739 align:start position:0%
the EMP itself due to uh
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
statutory prohibitions on sharing and
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
utilizing data outside of our specific
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
program and Mr chair maybe someday you
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
could educate me on how we identify the
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
why when we get the data like this you
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
know who who do we go to to help us
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
understand I don't think that the people
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
who are making the presentations would
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate this as an interest of hours
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
income to do that
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Holt just testified it's outside the
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
scope of their responsibilities to
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
address the why I said that there are
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
there are legislative barriers to to
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
making those assessments and comparing
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
various data sets could you with your
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
super with your superiors craft some
 
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.209 align:start position:0%
super with your superiors craft some
language

01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:52.219 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
that would help the legislature do just
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
we uh well he recovers representative
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
what we would we would uh we can we can
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
pull uh language that we've pulled for
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
many many years to be to allow the
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
department to access and utilize pdmp
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
data uh in more robust ways um we've
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
tried many many times and we've not been
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
successful in uh in expanding our data
 
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.590 align:start position:0%
successful in uh in expanding our data
representative

01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
or am I not correct that we are now
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
running up against the issue of
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
the desire on one hand to collect
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful Health Care data across any
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
number of different platforms with the
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
other prevailing Trend that we have seen
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
particularly since the passage of the
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which is
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
protection of privacy and the trend
 
01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:55.580 align:start position:0%
towards disallowing data to be
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
collected in a way that allows you to
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
slice and dice on a very local level
 
01:53:04.090 --> 01:53:04.100 align:start position:0%
because or a very granular level because
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
that is much more likely to be
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
re-identified and to
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
then have people's most intimate stuff
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
shared with the general population and
 
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with that tension
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
for as long as I've been in the
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
legislature but currently we're on a the
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the the pendulum is swung towards
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
privacy rather than towards
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
public data
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh Public Health data collection
 
01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.430 align:start position:0%
uh Public Health data collection
yes

01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
only one way to understand that word
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Page 25 a wise colleague
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
suggested to me that in order perhaps
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
better to explain
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
why the big black vertical column under
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
the zero to 19 you provide us
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
um previous year's iteration of this
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
chart like sfy 20 to 21 19 to 20. give
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
us a five-year retrospective before this
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
one so that we can lay them in a side by
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
side by side and maybe uh infer some
 
01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
things wisely if you could do that
 
01:54:25.619 --> 01:54:26.510 align:start position:0%
things wisely if you could do that
please

01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchant
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
um also remind the committee
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
that the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
program the database that's in that
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
program is an essence of medical
 
01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.790 align:start position:0%
program is an essence of medical
information

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
into your episode Weber's point of view
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
is the question at that point in time is
 
01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.090 align:start position:0%
is the question at that point in time is
the

01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:49.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
the
intense

01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
intense
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
concern about privacy when you get to
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
someone's medical record I think we all
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
should be very cognitive with the fact
 
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
how it gets utilized and where it's
 
01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
released and so forth is extremely
 
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.169 align:start position:0%
released and so forth is extremely
important

01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
number two to the why I think it goes
 
01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
back to the licensing boards the issue
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
of why something is being prescribed is
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
a clinical decision
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
not a legislative one and I would
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
again conscious my peers here that we
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
somehow go back to the licensing boards
 
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
under the hospice of the prescription
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring program and saying was seeing
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
the spike but let the clinical people
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
understand what's causing the why and
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
not for us to try to get into it
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
legislatively I would be very willing to
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
do that thank you I agree with that if I
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
could follow up one thing please okay
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to I would like with
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
your leave please to bring this
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
discussion to a close after your
 
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up because we still have the
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
State Office of rural Health's annual
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
report and Ms Hernandez have been
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
sitting there very patiently and I know
 
01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
I'm able to stay a little bit longer but
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
not many not everybody may be so if we
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
could wrap it up I will
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
the other unintended consequence which I
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
think president Weber talked about
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's representative Nagel's brought to
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
our attention before
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
as much as we have a focus on the
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
mmes and so forth Etc the unintended
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
consequence is many times patients
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
because providers are very reluctant to
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
give the appropriate opiates to a
 
01:56:27.169 --> 01:56:27.179 align:start position:0%
patient because they don't want it going
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
before the board or being highlighted by
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the data there's that unintended
 
01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
consequence where all of a sudden
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
providers get antsy about writing for
 
01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
certain things inpatient care can go in
 
01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction so I just want to
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
make people aware of that fact is that
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
we need to be monitoring things but be
 
01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
cognitive of the fact that in the
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring process we're not
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr Holt thank
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
and you're not being given four minutes
 
01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
you're given as long as you need and as
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
many of us can stay as long as we can
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
will stay and
 
01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.530 align:start position:0%
will stay and
um

01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%

um I'm here to present this year's
 
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
annual report on the health status of
 
01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
rural residents and health Workforce
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
data collection efforts by the Health
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
Professions data center this is a
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement of the State
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
Office of rural Health which sits under
 
01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
rural health and Primary Care with
 
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
contribution by the health statistics
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
and data management office which my
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
colleague Dr Jessica sagona is here to
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
represent say the name slower please go
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
and what is your title
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior Public Health data analyst
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
senior wow
 
01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:03.890 align:start position:0%
senior wow
okay

01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna just highlight some
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
interesting parts of a very lengthy
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
report that you all have copies to and
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
can electronically access on the rural
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
health and Primary Care web pages
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
um so the first part of this report
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
covers the health status of rural
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
residents which our office determines by
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
revealing Health disparities that exist
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
between rural and non-rural residents in
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
the state and we break down rural
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
geography by overall aggregate region so
 
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
rural versus non-rural and by Regional
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
Public Health Network which is also
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
defined by morality
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
so we evaluate the help of the
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
population by analyzing Primary Care
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
Associated health indicators that reveal
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
access to and utilization and delivery
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
of primary care this includes
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
demographic risk factors like senior age
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
disability on insurance and so forth and
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
while we include a full list of the
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated indicators as an appendix and
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
the report that's appendix a only the
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
primary care Associated indicators found
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be statistically different by
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
geography are included in the data
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
summaries of the report one of the
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
exciting developments that we've
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
achieved over the last year is the
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
inclusion of a geographic filter for
 
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
rurality on the DHHS public facing data
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
portal so the data portal provides
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
aggregate Health Data statistics and
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple areas of Health like
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
chronic disease infectious disease
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
Community Health maternal and child
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
health substance use this will go so on
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
and so forth and the data portal now
 
01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:42.659 align:start position:0%
provides users with the ability to drill
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
down to rurality for significant
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
differences summarized by graphics and
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
rates and many of the indicators on the
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
data portal were just put pulled
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
directly for this report those that
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
aren't on the data data portal as of now
 
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
and are in this report we plan on
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
integrating in in the next coming years
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the big picture here is
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly there are significant
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
Health disparities between rural and
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
non-rural populations in the state when
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
considering population risk factors
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
access to Primary Care and health
 
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
outcomes rural populations are older
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
they're poorer they have higher rates of
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
visibility and on insurance travel times
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
to Health Care are longer Primary Care
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce Supply is lower
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits for
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted harm is higher smoking
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy is higher screening
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
rates for colonoscopy mammography and
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
two-year-old lead testing levels is
 
02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
lower rural populations are less likely
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
to have had a checkup in the last year
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
and the proportion of late stage breast
 
02:00:52.129 --> 02:00:52.139 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis and child lead levels
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
is higher in rural
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
across many of these categories of care
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
there are three regional public health
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
networks that really stick out against
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
the rest as having worse rates than
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
other individual Public Health regions
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
or aggregate region by morality that's
 
02:01:13.129 --> 02:01:13.139 align:start position:0%
North Country Winnipesaukee and Carroll
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
County a few particularly troubling
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
rates stood out including 20 percent of
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
residents in Winnipesaukee indicated
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
they don't have a primary care provider
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
rates of no or late prenatal care is
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
almost twice as high in Winnipesaukee
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
than the aggregate World rate and the
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
age-adjusted death rate for North
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
Country and Winnipesaukee is about 15
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
percent higher than the aggregate rule
 
02:01:41.410 --> 02:01:41.420 align:start position:0%
rate so these are obviously substantial
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
the exception to this pattern is for
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug related inpatient
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
Admissions and pqis are prevention
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
quality indicators which are basically
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
preventable medical complications with
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
access to proper primary care so with
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
these indicators rural outperforms
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
non-rural populations overall
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
all right so and it's a very large
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
report and you have access to all the
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
detail there if you do
 
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
um take a look in Greater detail I'd be
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with any questions
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have uh the second part of the
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
report focuses on our health Workforce
 
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
data collection efforts through provider
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
surveying um during license renewal and
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
leveraging Licensing data to more
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensively speak to supply in the
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
state when you mentioned the report and
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's extensive do you mean the executive
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
summary document so no that's involved
 
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's just the executive summary but
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's a 55 page report yeah and you
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
didn't make those oh good there is a
 
02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:46.850 align:start position:0%
copy here it looks like that no it is
 
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:50.709 align:start position:0%
copy here it looks like that no it is
[Music]

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much could we have copies
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
for us next month of course yes yes
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
um the data in the report reflects data
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
collected in 2020 as our turnaround time
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
for courses two years after data
 
02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:06.659 align:start position:0%
collection and the workforce data
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
reports can be found again on our rural
 
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
health and Primary Care web pages for
 
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
medical provider types including
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%

drug counselors and psychologists these
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
reports contain survey participation
 
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
rates and dashboards on provider and
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
practice characteristics of the
 
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
workforces including practice status
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%

02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
certification our oplc continues to work
 
02:03:49.209 --> 02:03:49.219 align:start position:0%
very closely with our office to reduce
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies and administrative
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
burdens and increase survey compliance
 
02:03:55.729 --> 02:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
which has obviously resulted in
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
increased response rates every cycle
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
year and this helps us accurately assess
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
the workforce Supply
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
now I'm gonna have you turn your
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
attention to uh one of the handouts in
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
your packet that's page 31 uh table 1.3
 
02:04:13.619 --> 02:04:15.649 align:start position:0%
your packet that's page 31 uh table 1.3
oh

02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:04:18.169 --> 02:04:18.179 align:start position:0%
there should be so the packet that has
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
the executive summary
 
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.370 align:start position:0%
the executive summary
yep

02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:24.890 align:start position:0%
yep
no

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's the stapled
 
02:04:29.410 --> 02:04:29.420 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.609 --> 02:04:42.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
now what this table does is that
 
02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
identifies changes in provider Supply
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
with providers lost so those providers
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
with an active license status that
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
didn't renew and providers gained those
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
that received an initial license in year
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
2020 and an analysis of the licensing
 
02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
list found that none of the primary
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
medical or Behavioral Health workforces
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
experienced a true loss of providers
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
during this period in fact PA saw a
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
moderate gain about seven percent and
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioner saw a more
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
substantial gain about 12 percent it is
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
worth mentioning of course that because
 
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
this took place and the height of the
 
02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:26.219 align:start position:0%
Copa 19 pandemic that it's unclear
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
whether there were providers just
 
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
maintaining an active license status and
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily clinically practicing in
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and those that were
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
clinically practicing was it at the top
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
of their license or were they simply
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
just aiding in the pandemic efforts
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to track this
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be clarified in the
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.129 --> 02:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
all right now the report also contains
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
data summaries for um the medical and
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health workforces
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that could compare Supply and
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
capacity differences between provider
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
types and this includes significant
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
differences between the rural and
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
non-world practicing providers and
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm going to have you turn
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
your attention to the third page in the
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
before we do
 
02:06:16.609 --> 02:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
um under uh mental health we have
 
02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists psychiatric nurse
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
practitioners psychologists alcohol and
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
drug counselors do you also have licsw
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
counselors and the equivalent yes so the
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners we do
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
collect data on and that includes licsws
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
lcmhc and so forth there was a data blip
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the reason why they're not contained
 
02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
in here is because it came to light that
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's a Mal distribution of providers
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
by license license renewal year the
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
intention is for them to be be evenly
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
distributed across year but at some
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
point in the last 10 years or so the
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
boards of actually psychology and mental
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
health practitioners are mental health
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
practice decided to group all of those
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
that received an initial license before
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
the year 2000 all together in odd years
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
so now we have all of those that have
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
been practicing for a long time and of
 
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
older age all together in one group and
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're no longer you know an equal
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
distribution of cohorts
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
um and so at at that point we had to
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
wait another year in order to get those
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
summary the data summaries together page
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
three okay
 
02:07:29.089 --> 02:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
um all right so page 36 here this is a
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
nice snapshot of the characteristics
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
shown to be significantly different
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
between rural and non-rural practicing
 
02:07:36.649 --> 02:07:36.659 align:start position:0%
providers the same summary as I said
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
does exist for Behavioral Health
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce providers but I wanted to draw
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
your attention to this handout to really
 
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.179 align:start position:0%
just highlight the incredible value the
 
02:07:48.169 --> 02:07:48.179 align:start position:0%
summary holds these measures which act
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
as indicators to Recruitment and
 
02:07:52.490 --> 02:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
Retention are really critical for a
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce efforts they're used in
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
application for Grants to support and
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
strengthen the primary care Workforce so
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
you can see just in the first table
 
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
rural Physicians are more likely
 
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
um statistically more likely to have New
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ties to have worked or lived
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire prior to receiving
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
their license to have attended a New
 
02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical School which is guys
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
all to have trained in a residency
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire and it's about
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
three times as likely as non-roll
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
practicing Physicians and less likely to
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
provide outpatient primary care services
 
02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
and less likely to practice a mental
 
02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
health specialty and that just speaks to
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
the shortage in rural so data like this
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
is directly used actually to justify the
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
need for Rural residencies like our
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
newly developed co-was and Cheshire
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
Family Medicine Residency programs and
 
02:08:45.169 --> 02:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
also Workforce pipeline programs we used
 
02:08:57.850 --> 02:08:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's like where's the trick
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to run for the house and
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
come into my committee all right
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
just wondered where it was up there
 
02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:20.930 align:start position:0%
just wondered where it was up there
centered

02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
pointing it early yeah I know where
 
02:09:24.250 --> 02:09:24.260 align:start position:0%
you're pointing
 
02:09:28.209 --> 02:09:28.219 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you thank you
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know we've known each other seven
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
um and then of course also Workforce
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
pipeline programs programs Fair headed
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
by UNH and Dartmouth
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um most recently the the rural um
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Grant funds um that were able
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
to be secured by federal funding
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
um you know data like this helps in the
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
application so the Health Professions
 
02:09:53.930 --> 02:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
data center really continues to show
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
immense value the data is used to inform
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
shortage designation which our office is
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
required to coordinate for New Hampshire
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
this brings providers and funding uh to
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
underserved areas of the state with a
 
02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
lack of primary care providers and
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
because of shortage excuse me survey
 
02:10:13.729 --> 02:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
implementation when a new shortage
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
designation was developed this year by
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
the health resources and services
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%

02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%

02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
to accurately and quickly submit OB GYN

02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
data for designation and consideration
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
because it was already within our
 
02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.570 align:start position:0%
because it was already within our

02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
um just as you know this is just an
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
example that data center provides
 
02:10:45.169 --> 02:10:45.179 align:start position:0%

oh that's a mouthful
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
we work closely with members of the
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission to put the data into action
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
so we work with key stakeholders on the
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
commission including UNH Geisel the
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
medical association the nurse

New Hampshire recruitment center and
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
many more
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
internal requests are frequent and this
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
year we've informed the work of maternal
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
and child health the oral health program
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Ryan White program and and
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
more so the data center is really doing
 
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what the legislature intended
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
and that's providing critically needed
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh data figures in order to tackle
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
the current and anticipated Primary Care
 
02:11:52.729 --> 02:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges in the state
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
no I'm just I'm I texted him
 
02:11:59.050 --> 02:11:59.060 align:start position:0%
um you're still going you're still on no
 
02:12:03.169 --> 02:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering I I I took the
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity while you were talking to
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
access your website so I could find the
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
report that we were talking about and
 
02:12:15.729 --> 02:12:15.739 align:start position:0%
I'm really interested in the designation
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
of what's a an a rural area and what's a
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
non-rural area because I've I've
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
actually been to Washington
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
and to find it that it's an urban area
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
is a matter of some astonishment to me
 
02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:33.609 align:start position:0%
is a matter of some astonishment to me
um

02:12:33.609 --> 02:12:33.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
how were the areas designated what was
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
the criteria for that so we use we
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
currently use population and population
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
density figures as there's a million uh
 
02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
as you know right Federal definitions of
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
role within the office we use those
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
metrics to designate rural on the level
 
02:12:57.890 --> 02:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
of just Regional Public Health Network
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
and all those towns that fall underneath
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
roll up however the question comes at a
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
good time because we are currently in
 
02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
the midst of of changing the methodology
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
to actually drill down to defining rural
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
by town because of that exact reason
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
that there are these nuances within
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
Regional public health networks and for
 
02:13:21.649 --> 02:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce considerations Lebanon and
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
Hanover right that sort of
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
um uh skews the true relationship and
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
this true shortages we see between rural
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
and non-rural because there's a wealth
 
02:13:34.609 --> 02:13:34.619 align:start position:0%
of you know Healthcare that's provided
 
02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
in those areas so once we were close to
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
finalizing we will certainly this year
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
and come out with a report that will be
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
publicly available and will be presented
 
02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
to this commission but it will do a
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
better job growing up outside of Boston
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
as a kid I asked my parents what does
 
02:13:56.169 --> 02:13:56.179 align:start position:0%
rural mean and they said New Hampshire
 
02:13:59.810 --> 02:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you
 
02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.649 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you
um

02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.530 --> 02:14:08.540 align:start position:0%
if the designation is
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
keyed to provider networks I kind of
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
understand that but just looking at the
 
02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
map itself I'm thinking about
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm applauding the idea of
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
drilling down a little more because uh
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
as several of us here have served on
 
02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
several redistricting commissions know
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
as well uh there are towns that look on
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
a map like they're connected to
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and uh getting theya from
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
here is not easy and
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
um uh so
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
some of the towns here look like a
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
really false notion of how easy it is
 
02:14:59.470 --> 02:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
and how proximal they are
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
to health care providers because of how
 
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
difficult it might be to get from from
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
one place to another in addition to the
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
fact of being
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
towns of very small populations so
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely and two-year refinement would
 
02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
be really helpful and to your point
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually the new methodology we're
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking at wouldn't just use population
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
and population density metrics as we
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently are it's actually considering
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
mileage from the nearest population
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
Center and in New Hampshire that just
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
means Manchester and Nashua and we're
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
considering drive time to the nearest
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I have a question
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
um my wife is a Unicom graduate and you
 
02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
may know that the University of New
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
England College of osteopathic medicine
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
was specifically
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
um the the savior of Saint Francis
 
02:15:58.010 --> 02:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
College when they no longer needed to be
 
02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
a francophone College in Biddeford and
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
it was the medical school was
 
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
established for Rural medicine in Maine
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
and some of the numbers of rural
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
providers in Maine are really heartening
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
um one of my uncles was one of them and
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
so my question is to what degree are you
 
02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
going to be improving your link with
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
Unicom and might I suggest knowing a few
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
faculty and administrative people there
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
even to the point of perhaps a satellite
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
campus of Unicom
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure if um director Trisha
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
Tilley wants to speak more to this the
 
02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
commission that I mentioned earlier in
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
the poor report actually does have two
 
02:16:43.250 --> 02:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives that come
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you know with concerns of primary
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
care and how to sort of think through
 
02:16:48.770 --> 02:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
the challenges of New Hampshire
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
um from une
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if there's any existing
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
relationships now
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
um between une and some of you know the
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
attempts and the rural areas to get
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know recruitment over there and
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
pipeline work there unless this would
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
interrupt and some other people have to
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
leave I can speak with director Tilly
 
02:17:12.530 --> 02:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
after the meeting
 
02:17:14.509 --> 02:17:14.519 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
information right now but we have
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
several we have been connected with une
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
with some of the helpful Workforce
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
Development yeah we're good there's lots
 
02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
of different pieces in the pie we could
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
come at another time and actually give
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
you a more comprehensive presentation on
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
that of all of the workforce initiatives
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
or at least you and I can sit down
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
because we have a big stake in une and
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
our we are a rotation clinical site
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
um also before you get back on track
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I text people in the audience
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
during the meeting to make me look
 
02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
intelligent and uh one of one of my
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
usual suspects
 
02:17:57.770 --> 02:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
um is to ask Danielle which legislators
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge participate with this
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
commission you mentioned
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
so we're actually currently in the
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
process of having a new uh
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative appointed to the
 
02:18:16.310 --> 02:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
commission uh I know that that letters
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of uh being processed
 
02:18:23.650 --> 02:18:23.660 align:start position:0%
now and I can't remember the name
 
02:18:26.089 --> 02:18:26.099 align:start position:0%
we will get back to you we will get back
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
to you
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
um but previously it was representative
 
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
um Lori Harding
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes
 
02:18:33.179 --> 02:18:36.849 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes
um

02:18:36.849 --> 02:18:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
right right I work extensively with the
 
02:18:43.129 --> 02:18:43.139 align:start position:0%
speaker's office on recruiting and
 
02:18:45.770 --> 02:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
nominating people to boards so if you
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
want me to grease the skids let me know
 
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
what you're doing I have a meeting up
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
there when we finish here but there's
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
been a backlog and they've asked me to
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
step in and help I remember now Jim
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going up there after this and I'll
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
make sure this gets expedited right okay
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:10.979 --> 02:19:12.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
continue

02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:12.260 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
unless there's a question representative
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I see a lot of focus on the medical
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
side which is important obviously but
 
02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I've heard before
 
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
this comment was working at the top of
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
the license yeah and given the fact that
 
02:19:34.570 --> 02:19:34.580 align:start position:0%
it's time wise less time
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
involved and less constraint
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
with resources to help move along the
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
advanced nurse practitioners and PAs
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to try to increase
 
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
that Workforce because
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
if we can take some of the items that a
 
02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
physician doesn't have to do
 
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
from a clinical point of view not the
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
legal point of view but down shifted to
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of personnel it would free up
 
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks on the higher end to
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
do and take care of the patients at that
 
02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum versus trying to
 
02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
constantly fill that void so is there
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
any work going on in New Hampshire to
 
02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
try to find ways to take mid-level
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
practitioners and and enhance them so we
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
can take what time we do have with the
 
02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
higher level practitioners to utilize
 
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
that time more efficiently effectively
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and I actually do
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
have a list maintained of all of the new
 
02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
er since 2020 pipeline programs
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
um that have come into existence
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
um one of them is certainly a registered
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
nurse pipeline program I do work
 
02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
actually closely with the Clinical
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
Director of the unh's NP fellowship
 
02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:51.170 align:start position:0%
Director of the unh's NP fellowship
program

02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
um although that's a little right
 
02:20:56.690 --> 02:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
separate from being able to you know
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
have have duties be distinct and have
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
um focus on the the registered nurse
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
side of things it's not per se
 
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
registered nurse is looking at the nurse
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner which is a higher level
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
than an RN and trying to understand at
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that point in time is growing that
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
mid-level Spectrum for
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's probably easier time wise resources
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
in order to get them educated at that
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
level than trying to go through the
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
medical schools and training they have
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
to go through become a physician just
 
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
trying to find what are we doing as a
 
02:21:28.570 --> 02:21:28.580 align:start position:0%
state to try to enhance that mid-level
 
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
category of providers
 
02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
so we can try to take what we do have on
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
the physician side which is the higher
 
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
end of the scale and utilize that time
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
as effectively as efficiently for
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
patient care as we can
 
02:21:43.849 --> 02:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
with the chair's permission I can say
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we're also
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
doing is that you come up to a live mic
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
so this gets recorded please as a
 
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
complimentary effort to that is the work
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
of um our state loan repayment program
 
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
which has really not only focused at the
 
02:22:00.170 --> 02:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
top with the Physicians with all of the
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
mid-level providers so we're seeing you
 
02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
know significant numbers of aprns coming
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
in Pas coming in that we're able to
 
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
support that way as well as the
 
02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
mid-level providers in the behavioral
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
health space but to your other point of
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
how do we maximize them within a
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
practice I think that is a separate line
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we are working with some of the
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
pipeline you know to ensure that the
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
pipeline folks you know as they're
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
coming up through that they're well
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
prepared to work to the top of their
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
um capacity and then we certainly see
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
great you know examples of that like in
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
our fqhcs and other places that really
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
do know how to maximize the use of of
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
those providers there's more we could do
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
in that space But we're coming at it
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
with from like a bunch of different
 
02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
angles slurp being one of the main ones
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
other questions so far
 
02:22:55.690 --> 02:22:55.700 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll keep going oh I'm done
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
wow this then there's Jessica and she
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
can move close actually moving the mic
 
02:23:04.969 --> 02:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
closer to you actually I don't have a
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
separate uh presentation she's here for
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
the technical questions around some of
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
the data sets representative Edwards
 
02:23:13.849 --> 02:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
took this occasion to come up with a
 
02:23:13.859 --> 02:23:14.830 align:start position:0%
took this occasion to come up with a
question

02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm curious
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
um to what extent you crosswalk this
 
02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
with other entities that are floating
 
02:23:24.490 --> 02:23:24.500 align:start position:0%
around out there I I was specifically
 
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's a um a tele commission to study
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and you know what they
 
02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
found was uh ironically telemedicine is
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
being used more in the non-rural areas
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
than in the rural areas and when we dug
 
02:23:44.210 --> 02:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
into the why of that the why of that was
 
02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
mostly a bandwidth issue to a lot of
 
02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:50.300 align:start position:0%
places and so understanding the why
 
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
helped strengthen the idea that we
 
02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
should support some band with
 
02:23:58.610 --> 02:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
development issues out in the rural
 
02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
02:24:02.929 --> 02:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
so knowing why is important even if
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
we're not clinicians but but in any case
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
um the real question is do you there are
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
so many different entities looking at
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
the rural health problem I'm just
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
curious to to what extent you've
 
02:24:19.010 --> 02:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
identified other entities with other
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
pieces that are relevant to the your
 
02:24:21.479 --> 02:24:24.170 align:start position:0%
pieces that are relevant to the your
picture

02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:25.610 align:start position:0%
 
many

02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.170 align:start position:0%
many
um

02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
working parts to this of course so where
 
02:24:33.410 --> 02:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
we come in under rural health and
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
Primary Care you know is our focus on
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
access you know ensuring access to
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
Quality primary care for citizens of New
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to try to mitigate disparities
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of course you know along
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
with Health Care access or socioeconomic
 
02:24:52.270 --> 02:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
there's behavioral there's Community
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different legs of this
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
and I know that
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
um within you know I can't speak to the
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
whole of dphs and all of the efforts
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
going on under the division and even
 
02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
really the community community efforts
 
02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
all I can speak to is really our
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
specific work and sort of the entities
 
02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
and the stakeholders we work with to try
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
to get this data out because now
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
remember that this report really serves
 
02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
to inform policy by highlighting areas
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
of concern right so that we can address
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
them and it's getting it into the hands
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders that make it action
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
people that can do something with it
 
02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay so um in the ticker reporter in the
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
executive summary I was wanting to see
 
02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
something that read like a recommended
 
02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
Solutions or potential approaches you
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
know taking all of the ocean boiling it
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
down and just giving us okay so this is
 
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
what the smart people think we ought to
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
be doing from a policy perspective and I
 
02:25:58.490 --> 02:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
did not see that no you didn't
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
um again because the aim of the Rapport
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
is sort of exploratory get the data out
 
02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
there how can it be actionable but I
 
02:26:07.309 --> 02:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
will say the other statutory requirement
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
that comes along with this report is to
 
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
again inform the work and policy
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
planning of that legislative commission
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I had mentioned earlier and in
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
their final report the data here is used
 
02:26:21.770 --> 02:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
to inform that data report that has
 
02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations on yes yes so they're
 
02:26:26.450 --> 02:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
one of the entities of course again
 
02:26:28.969 --> 02:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
before we use this data directly for
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
federal shortage designation as well for
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
State loan repayment program as well
 
02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
which also is administered under rural
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
health and Primary Care to your
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge does that report of that
 
02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee come here as well or will we
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
have to threaten one of our own members
 
02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
to release it to us
 
02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
I don't I guess not no I don't believe
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
so not as yet no but
 
02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
um the final report
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
um is actually due in 20 next year and
 
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.170 align:start position:0%
um is actually due in 20 next year and
2024.

02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
02:27:05.090 --> 02:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and that will have recommendations of
 
02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
sort of all of this data that's been
 
02:27:08.929 --> 02:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
collected over the last
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
um you know four years actually since
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
the the bill
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
um the bill passed that extended the
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
commission one is hoping June of 2024
 
02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
because we start writing builds over the
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
summer and have to have them in by
 
02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
November and if it is November of 2024
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
you've wasted a year
 
02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that report's due date is
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the middle of 2024. it is November
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
1st but all right and let me tell you
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
that means no later than but it could
 
02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
mean quite earlier then and it would be
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
in your advantage if it were earlier
 
02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
then right
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative I also note that serving
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
on rules we just
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
um passed the resolution that we pass
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
every single year that says that reports
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
that come due in November uh that
 
02:28:00.770 --> 02:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation uh we give a
 
02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
blanket pass
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
from the reporting from from the filing
 
02:28:07.690 --> 02:28:07.700 align:start position:0%
deadlines so
 
02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
the filing deadlines for next year are
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
going to be very limited September
 
02:28:17.809 --> 02:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
window but we always every year need to
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that there are many
 
02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that report
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
sometime right around the beginning of
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
November and often recommend legislation
 
02:28:32.170 --> 02:28:32.180 align:start position:0%
and so every year if it is recommended
 
02:28:36.610 --> 02:28:36.620 align:start position:0%
by the majority of a sitting committee
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
that legislation is
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
automatically given a blanket
 
02:28:46.849 --> 02:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
pass on the deadline so that it can be
 
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
drafted and and started without waiting
 
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
a whole nother 12 months
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
as a wise man once said that's on the
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
house side I don't know how they do it
 
02:29:05.290 --> 02:29:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions pretty much we do
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing it's just not as formal
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
passing a minute yeah we have 400 people
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
we have to do it this way any other
 
02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
questions anything else you want to give
 
02:29:26.270 --> 02:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
does uh director Tilly wish to add
 
02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:31.070 align:start position:0%
does uh director Tilly wish to add
anything

02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
