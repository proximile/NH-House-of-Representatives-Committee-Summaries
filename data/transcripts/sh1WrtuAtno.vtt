from the consent agent
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative lamb uh thank you
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair um if I had a question about
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
whether the ell definition would impact
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
school funding would that be something
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we pull or is that just a
 
00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
an over anxious question
 
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 align:start position:0%
what a good question which uh
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
which definition is it which um that is
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
on the third one on the agenda FP uh
 
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.749 align:start position:0%
on the third one on the agenda FP uh
2023-23

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's the uh esol teacher correct
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that would affect
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's about the qualifications for a
 
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.650 align:start position:0%
that's about the qualifications for a
teacher

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it defines English language learner
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
as long as that's an entirely separate
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
section which not in which would not
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
impact school money I have no objection
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
to consent but I wanted to raise the
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
question ah
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
you're from
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
um this um
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
what is this doing it's relative to the
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
licensure standard of an esol teacher
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and changes were proposed by the
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board
 
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
so it's all about their licensing the
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
question is does the definition of an
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
English English language learner
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
differ in any way from the definition
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
that is used for school funding
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm unsure I'd have to
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
pull it back up
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
if the agency is here
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if the agency is here then
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps they could answer the question
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes is there someone who can answer that
 
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:51.050 align:start position:0%
yes is there someone who can answer that
question

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
turn your background please
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
there you go leave the light on
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
I know it went off when you hit it again
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
so it's supposed to be red okay
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
um good morning Julie Shea
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator for the
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
um that definition did not change from
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
the last proposal and so I would imagine
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to affect anything
 
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.050 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to affect anything
because

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
it was already there before
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
um the the changes that were made to the
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
proposal for the esol teacher did not
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
involve the definitions
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
and they were already there
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
from the draft from
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
the prior rules it did change where OLS
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
made some comments regarding how the
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
definitions were written because
 
00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459 align:start position:0%
um the way that we had it separated out
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the proper format
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
and then if that doesn't impact the
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
funding definition then I have no
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
problem with consent I just wanted to
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that that does not expand the
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
definition for funding that I I don't
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
know all I can speak to is what was
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
there before and that I I don't think it
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
had any impact prior
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I can either follow up or I can ask
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
the division director who is down the
 
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.829 align:start position:0%
the division director who is down the
street

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
then perhaps I should pull that from
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
consent okay we will pull that second
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
sent you will contact the division
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
director to make sure there's no impact
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions on the
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
consent agenda um is 2023 100 still on
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
the consent agenda if so I would like to
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
pull that
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
it is uh the item v and the consent
 
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
it is uh the item v and the consent
calendar

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
Item B is a V C is in Vector oh Victor
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you I hadn't gone that far
 
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay I'd like to pull that from
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
consent as well okay
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
any other uh representative
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.949 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
um

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
I noticed a grammatical error on of
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
subsection B which is the charter school
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
lease Aid
 
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.130 align:start position:0%
lease Aid
um

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
page five there's a small grammatical
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
error so I wasn't sure if that warranted
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
being removed
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
director that can be corrected
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
editorially at the time of adoption
 
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.970 align:start position:0%
editorially at the time of adoption
okay

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman improved consent minus
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
the items that were pulled second second
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by you
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn okay
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
any further discussion comments or
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
things to remove
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed
 
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed
okay

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
the first one on the regular agenda is
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes this this rule is no longer
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
necessary because the office the Allied
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
health professionals office was
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh deleted in House Bill too so it was
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
it does not exist
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
2023 15 is
 
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.829 align:start position:0%
2023 15 is
um

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
essentially the issue is that
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
there's a seal of the board
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:08.540 align:start position:0%
the board is now using a generic steel
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
so when
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
a person
 
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
sees the seal it doesn't say that it's
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
for geologists it's just a generic PLC
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
board and
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
um we think that this could could be
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
confusing if somebody has a seal that
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't identify the board it's for and
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's just a generic seal it's a generic
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
oplc board
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
I know PLC is going to all generic seals
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
kind of for everybody but it it may be
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
confusing if you can't tell which board
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's from
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
if I could step in here
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
um so the next proposal also has the
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
same issue and so the board statutes
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
actually required the board to adopt an
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
official seal a design for official seal
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
so it's unclear it's probably not what
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature intended a generic seal
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
they wanted a specific seal for each
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
board and so both in 15 and in this one
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
one for geologists and then the board of
 
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.949 align:start position:0%
one for geologists and then the board of
Architects

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
Architects
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
um like it like Christina said it just
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
says New Hampshire board councils and
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
commissions so there's no indication
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
that it's specific to either geologist
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
or to Architects and we're seeing this a
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
lot in the IPS so um so it would be good
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and figure this out
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes CNN
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um from the office of professional
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
oplc takes care of all the paperwork of
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
the boards they process all the licenses
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
they do all of that
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
and so that having a seal for each board
 
00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:54.290 align:start position:0%
and so that having a seal for each board
um

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
I don't believe is necessary it says in
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
the rulemaker story that the board will
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
have a design design and official seal
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
they've chosen to go with a generic seal
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
any documents that are sealed would have
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
the name of the board on it so I don't
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe it would be confusing as to
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
which board the documents are from
 
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
could you explain how that happens if
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
you've got a generic seal how does it
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
say this is a geologist that's it that's
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
stamping this document no there's two
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
that's two different things the
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
geologists who have to seal their their
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
documents have their own seal that's a
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
different rule this is the seal that the
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
board say they had a if if we still
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
sealed licenses
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
this would be that seal that would be
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
used to seal a license like we used to
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
do I don't believe seals are used
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
so they're using the generic they're
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
using the generic seal the document
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
itself has the name of the board but the
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
seal the raised seal
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corona thank you I just
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
want to understand make sure that I
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying so you're
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
saying that let's say someone's applying
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
for a license for
 
00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:15.230 align:start position:0%
for a license for
um

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
structural for architectural
 
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.930 align:start position:0%
structural for architectural
Landscaping

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
Landscaping
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
their their license would have a generic
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
seal that says that
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to think of where you
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
would use this generic seal versus
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
certifying that the work is being done
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
by someone who's certified
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I can answer that question Lindsay
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director oplc so the
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
seals are rarely used at this point
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
um since we have moved away from a paper
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
process they're mostly used for wall
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
certificates when people request them
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
and we do we do use seals for wall
 
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
and we do we do use seals for wall
certificates

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
um upon request the whole purpose of
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
this seal is really to just designate
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
that it's an official state of New
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seal and that's the purpose
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
and I think a generic steel satisfies uh
 
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
the purpose of of the seal requirement
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
in the statute regarding the other
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
skills those are entirely different and
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
would designate you know typically a
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
license number for that professional the
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
profession but it's very separate and
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
distinct from the actual State of New
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seal
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so what you're saying is that
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
if somebody asks for a wall certificate
 
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:31.460 align:start position:0%
and they're an architectural
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
landscape architect then they would get
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
a certificate from oplc that has a
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
generic seal but it would still say
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere on that license
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
what this profession is correct they
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
would say State of New Hampshire or this
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
person authorized to practice as
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
landscape architect and then
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the seal usually at the bottom right
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
hand corner I think and if an individual
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
needs their seal for their work that's
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
something where do they get that
 
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
so typically that's required in a lot of
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
technical professions
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
um they get that on their own in
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
accordance with the regulations
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
established by the profession all right
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm satisfied
 
00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.370 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm satisfied
representative

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
um suppose a board wanted to support the
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
the board that covers the
 
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.100 align:start position:0%
I guess we're talking about geologists
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to write like a
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
some kind of official letter
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
you'd you'd have them write that
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
under the seal and of oplc
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
in general it I'm just thinking that
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
they would want to distinguish them who
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
that ruling is coming from or or request
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
so I'm not aware of an official letter
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
that a board would be able to write
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to issue orders they'd be
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
able to issue declaratory rulings
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
typically we advise against the boards
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
from just taking positions that isn't um
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a basis in statute
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I suppose if they wanted to designate
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
our position is that that the seal which
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
again the purpose is to just make clear
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
that it's a state of neometrial function
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
isn't administrative function that falls
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
within our statute
 
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.010 align:start position:0%
within our statute
okay

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
not clear that I understand that support
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
suppose there's a
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to write a letter and
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's part of a
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
public hearing or something and they're
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
writing an opinion of the board on
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
something or I don't know might be a
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action I don't know if
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
you're the person you know the oplc
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
takes disciplinary actions or the board
 
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.690 align:start position:0%
takes disciplinary actions or the board
does

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
just to just just so there's no
 
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.529 align:start position:0%
just to just just so there's no
confusion

00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
that whatever that document is is coming
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
from the board
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
there is no confusion because typically
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's a header that says you know
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire Board of name
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
your board
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and then order on blah blah blah just
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
as I went Court opinions we don't we
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't seal disciplinary documents
 
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
don't seal disciplinary documents
um

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
um like it or not I believe that they
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
they have met the the legal requirements
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
what we've written in the law uh the
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
objection from staff was whether there
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
would be confusion we've heard testimony
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department that it should not
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
and will not we are all able to write
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislation in the coming year and I
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
think we've discussed this enough and
 
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
seconded by uh Senator Gray
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that the distinction
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
between the board seal and the Seal of
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
the individual professionals
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
is very important because that's the
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
seal that needs to say
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
what the profession is and who the
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
person is who's doing the official seal
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that was brought up and
 
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that was brought up and
clarified

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to approve the rule
 
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to approve the rule
of

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you the
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%

issues other than that one okay
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
excuse me can I ask a question please of
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
the chair I'll be saying then therefore
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
we approve the removing of the Seal of
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
the generic seal
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
for the boards act stamping of things
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
like wall licenses yes I this I vote no
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
let the record reflect that senate

representative grow to voted no on the
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
geologist's rules Senator Lang

I moved to approve 54.
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
by Senator Ennis
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none those in favor
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed

no no all right representative grow to
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
Public Health Laboratories
 
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.020 align:start position:0%
so this proposal uh
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
2023-32 the agency did file a
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that addressed
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
all of our substantive comments except
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
for one and the one remaining really
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
would need a legislative fix as it has
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
to do with two conflicting statutes
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
the agency is authorized to uh
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
set in administer administ
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
administrative fines in the statutes
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
however where that fine money goes
 
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:07.460 align:start position:0%
there's a bit of a conflict so RSA 5 151
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
16a directs the agency to forward those
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
fines to the state treasury in the
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
straight State Treasury to put that in
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund however the next
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
statute are say 155 16 B directs the
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
state treasurer once they receive the
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
administrative fines and civil penalties
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
from the agency to put that money in a
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
separate non-lapsing interest bearing
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
account so there was a question of
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
whether the legislative intent was that
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
there are two different types of
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
administrative fines that will go into
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
two different
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
accounts or if the intent was to have
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
all of the administrative fines put into
 
00:23:47.409 --> 00:23:47.419 align:start position:0%
one account but which one it's unclear
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
so that was the only comment I had with
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal sounds
 
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.169 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal sounds
interesting

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay good morning for the record my name
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
is Doreen Shockley I'm the manager of
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Licensing and
 
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.930 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Licensing and
certification

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
um we would like to thank OLS attorney
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
for discovering this inconsistency
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
um we the legislation for the second
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
section B was
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
enacted or effective in 2010 so the
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistent language has existed since
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
2010 after receiving your comment I
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
consulted with one of our attorneys who
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
agreed that there is Need for
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
clarification and therefore we are
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
already in the process of putting forth
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it's also worth
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
noting that the intention was in fact
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
civil money penalties CMP penalties are
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
very different than the others and we do
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
We are following the intention and one
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
is in the general fund and one is in a
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
separate non-lapsing recurring
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly you're
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
saying you're working with some
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislator to clarify which fines go
 
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.130 align:start position:0%
legislator to clarify which fines go
where

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
but you think you want you think you
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
understand it and have been doing so
 
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.430 align:start position:0%
understand it and have been doing so
correct

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
um my question is about what appears to
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
be some expansion and scope in the
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
licensing rules
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
um in 808
 
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
um in 808
um

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
0.0102 e it says that this is everybody
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
who is not covered by this it says all
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
entities that performed wave testing for
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose of risk assessment and
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
which test results are not used for the
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis treatment monitoring or
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
consideration to provide or continue to
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
provide treatment of disease the
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
existing rule only says that are not
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
used for diagnosis or treatment of
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
disease and I'm curious where there's
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
this statutory authority to potentially
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
greatly expand the regulation under this
 
00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:02.390 align:start position:0%
greatly expand the regulation under this
rule

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.710 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.890 align:start position:0%
good
no

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
Miss Chocolate I guess I'm not really
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the question
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
it the question is
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
um before there was nothing that
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
required that a lab that is only doing
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
risk assessment
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
um and not providing diagnosis or
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
treatment of disease but if you say it
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring or consideration to provide
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
treatment that would be any sort of
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
early Wellness testing where you might
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
be looking at at not looking at any
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
level of clinical disease but people
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
looking to see what their risk factors
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
are and in order to decide whether or
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
not it is necessary in order to escalate
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
to a physician by background as a device
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
analyst I did some work in laboratory
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
and Diagnostics so the distinction may
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
seem minutia to you but I've seen the
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
application thank you for your question
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to our unit chief of
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensing unit for health facilities
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
good morning so the exemption was
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
expanded upon on the recommendation of
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
the CLIA coordinator CMS because the if
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's risk assessment only and they're
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
not considering treatment or providing
 
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.210 align:start position:0%
not considering treatment or providing
diagnosis

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
you know diagnosing opinion than it
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
would be for health fairs screening
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
Wellness like when a hospital puts on
 
00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
you know for employees it's the intent
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
was to avoid the burden of Licensing for
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
those type of screenings rather than
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and diagnosing do I understand
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
correctly that this expands the type
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
type of Laboratories that do not need
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
licensing rather than the ones that do
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
so it may exempt some existing
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
Laboratories from licensure is that
 
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.610 align:start position:0%
Laboratories from licensure is that
correct

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
no not a non-existing because a true
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
laboratory who's performing and testing
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
results for diagnosing or treatment they
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed this is you'll often
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
find fares that are that pop up in their
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
transient it could be blood pressure it
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
could be blood sugars it could be
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
cholesterol and it's finger sticks but
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
by the definition of a lab if you
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
produce a result and you're diagnosing
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
it you need a license and we agree with
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
that but these fares or screenings
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
aren't providing that type of service
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
what they do is they'll provide the
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
numbers like a blood pressure reading or
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
a blood sugar cholesterol and they
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
recommend going to your doctor okay so
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
as clarification wouldn't that be
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
consideration that you may need
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
treatment of disease
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
that when you have a high blood pressure
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
reading that they say you should go to
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
your doctor and find out if you need
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
care correct
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that this is not in the
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
inclusive part this is the one that
 
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:03.419 align:start position:0%
rules people out it says that
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
um if it's not used for consideration to
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
provide treatment that it is required to
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
be licensed to be be ruled underneath
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
now it's tough because it's a negative
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
and then it's a negative within there so
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I do I see what you're saying for
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
sure and I think it's just a wording
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the intent is that the results aren't
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
used for that but if we're wording it
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
wrong and it's inferring that then we
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that thank you I think
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if we could go to
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
the original language not used for the
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or treatment of disease
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
because that is that that would exclude
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of these screening fairs or other
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
can you restate how you want that
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
written I understand it better thank you
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes that way we can have the information
 
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:17.180 align:start position:0%
this is in Hep 808.02e
 
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.529 align:start position:0%
this is in Hep 808.02e
[Music]

00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that I would like it stated all
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
entities that performed wave testing for
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose of risk assessment and
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
which test results are not used for the
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or treatment of disease
 
00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:31.190 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or treatment of disease
semicolon

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
semicolon
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
language we have that right here and we
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
can send the official language to Olaf
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that will help any
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
further comments or ask representative
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
lamb uh thank you sorry I have another
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
question here in the area of
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
non-compliance which is in dot o3c so
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
right on the same page that is a new
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
area and I saw that previously in the
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
similar section it did not include a
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for State licensure to
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
comply with other federal or state
 
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
requirements so we we've seen the impact
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
of some federal requirements that are
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
just rules or
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that may not have have the full
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
backing and full strength that this
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
would then cause a problem where
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
um where it could bring state
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal requirements that
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
this doesn't spell out that it needs to
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
be a rule it doesn't need to be a law
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
but is this a CDC recommendation and I'm
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about that scope creep
 
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.289 align:start position:0%
concerned about that scope creep
yeah

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
could you say that a different way I'm
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
sorry because we do have the authority
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
if it is a Federal Regulation but CDC
 
00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:40.789 align:start position:0%
if it is a Federal Regulation but CDC
guidance

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
we can't enforce guidance is it a record
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
would that the CDC guidance be a
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirement or no because this is
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
replacing deficiency and it had the same
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
definition but this area of
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance adds or other federal or
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
state requirements and I'm just curious
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
the implications Madam chair yes I I
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
think because it said Federal
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that would include uh
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
federal law or federal regulations uh in
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
the CFR but nothing else okay thank you
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
that clarification is very helpful so
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'll go through all that question thank
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions
 
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.230 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions
comments

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a motion moved or
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
approve as edited
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
second okay that's a conditional
 
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.690 align:start position:0%
second okay that's a conditional
approval

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.370 align:start position:0%
approval
and

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add if that's okay with you
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
Senator that the department continue to
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
work for the legislative fix on their
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
funding issues oh actually I mean there
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure would that be a
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation to be added to the motion
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh further discussion or
 
00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh further discussion or
comment

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to conditionally
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
accept the rules with the recommendation
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
they get legislative fixed
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.289 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
okay

00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
so the next couple of proposals
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
um the first issue that's going to be
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussed will
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
apply to not only 20 23 52 but also to
 
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:25.700 align:start position:0%
the three subsequent ones so F through H
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and this particular issue as we
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
discussed last time has to do with the
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
administrative processing fees versus a
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
licensing fee so the oplc did submit a
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's amended conditional approval
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
because their original conditional
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
approval had just removed a fee from the
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
Plumber's table in that particular rule
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
section so this amended conditional
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
approval they have changed it from
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
saying application related fees to
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
application processing and Licensing
 
00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:01.970 align:start position:0%
application processing and Licensing
fees

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the section title of each different
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
section and then with regard to the
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
table itself in the places where it had
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
said application processing they have
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
added after that and Licensing
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
it is our office's opinion that this
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't really address the issue that
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
was brought up which is what is
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
constitutes a licensing fee versus what
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
constitutes an application fee as these
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
are two very different fees one is
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
refundable as it is a benefit conferred
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
or a conditional privilege which would
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
be the granting of the license and when
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
you look at the board statutes as a
 
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:45.500 align:start position:0%
whole it's very clear that these are
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
benefits because the statutes at least
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that we have looked at so far
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
which primarily are the court reporters
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the recreational therapists State
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
very clearly that you cannot practice
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
these professions without a license and
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
therefore it would be a conditional
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
privilege for you to
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
be able to practice because you need
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
that license
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
I believe our original recommendation
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
was to just remove the application fees
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
and just have them as licensing fees as
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
the oplc was unable to tell which would
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
be considered a license fee versus what
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
would be considered an application fee
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
for each of these sections and they had
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they needed these rules
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
to go forward so to address the issue
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
for now just call them licensing fees
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then have them go back and
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
reevaluate what would be considered an
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
application fee
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
however it seems that they've just added
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
licensing to make it clear that there
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
are two fees but they still have not
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
separated them
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um I yes thank you we
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Broda and I met with the
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
oplc on this issue because we agree that
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
there is in fact a license and a
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
licensing fee and the
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc is unable at this time to
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
determine how much of the fee is a
 
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
application fee
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
which does exist
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
versus the licensing fee and that they
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
will be revising this as they deal with
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
each individual profession
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
which was agreeable to us because it
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
turns out that
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
requests for refunds of license fees are
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
not common
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
the most the most usual case is that
 
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
the most the most usual case is that
someone

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
is in the middle of an application and
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
withdraws it probably because I think
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
they won't get a license
 
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.690 align:start position:0%
they won't get a license
and

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that can be dealt with
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis if I could just
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
jump in um you know since the agency
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what portion of the fee is
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a cost recovery and not you
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
know for a conditional benefit then it
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
really would make sense to amend these
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
rules to indicate only that there are
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
licensing fees until they know what
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
portion of that fee is cost recovery in
 
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:18.740 align:start position:0%
some cases they can probably identify it
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
when we get to court reporters I can
 
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:23.540 align:start position:0%
point that out for you for the committee
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
but yeah also to also keep in mind that
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of rulemaking over
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
the last eight to 12 months in which
 
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
those rules were approved that say that
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
application processing fees are
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
non-refundable and the agency is
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
including licensing fees that are
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
refundable within that so they really
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
need to go back and do some cleanup to
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
those rules so the agent you know you
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
may want to ask the agency or get the
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
agency to commit to amending those rules
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
that have approved
 
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsay Courtney executive
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
director oplc with me as attorney
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
Douglas osterhout from the office of
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
I think the issue before the committee
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
is really quite simple it's whether oplc
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
has the authority to charge the or
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
assess the fees that are
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
um proposed in the PLC 1002s and I think
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's quite clear that we do Under the
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
newly revised Statute or recodification
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
of oplc Statute which is 310 5. the
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
executive director of The Office shall
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
establish and collect all license
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
certification and renewal fees as well
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
as any necessary administrative fees I
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
know a council for Olas did acknowledge
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
in the court reporters filings that the
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
application fees can be considered an
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
administrative fee so clearly there is
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
authority to charge the proposed fees
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
now with respect to the application
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
versus licensing fee distinction I'm not
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a distinction and I
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
think that the materials cited by OLS in
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
the email that we received that's part
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
of your package
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
um really explain that you have to look
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
at the substance sense of what the fee
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
is actually doing and not just the
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
language that's being used we would
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually dispute that any of our fees
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
are for benefit conferred I don't think
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you get a benefit from having to be
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
required to actually obtain permission
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
from the government to perform an
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
occupation this legislature has stated
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
in statute that the right to pursue an
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
occupation is a fundamental right and I
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
think using the title the prohibition on
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
using the title of court reporter is
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
really intended for Consumer Protection
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
issue to make sure that the public
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
understands who's licensed and who's not
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
now when we talk about cost recovery the
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
materials cited by OLS talk about a cost
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
recovery a true fee which is not
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
refundable to be considered a fee the
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
amount paid to acquire quote a business
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
license must bear a relationship to and
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
approximate the expense of issuing the
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
license and of inspecting and regulating
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
the business license I think it's clear
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
that all of Opel suits fees support the
 
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
regulation of the profession
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
particularly now thanks to Senator Lang
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
and legislature that we have a
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund everything goes to
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
support the oplc regulation so I guess
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
in some I I think we have the authority
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think all of our fees are cost
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
recovery it doesn't really matter what
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
you call it because that's what's
 
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.130 align:start position:0%
you call it because that's what's
happening

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I would submit that their
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
fees are very reasonable in light of the
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
fact that the majority of the fees have
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
been in existence for years
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
and if I may just quickly jump in um it
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
never was an issue of whether or not
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
they had the authority it's very clear
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they have the authority to collect
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
these types of fees we're not arguing
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
that what we're arguing is
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
um as director Courtney pointed out we
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
see there's a distinction between these
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
fees which the OPC doesn't agree with
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and if that continues to be an issue
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
and if that is a concern for the
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee then perhaps legislation can
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
come forward to clarify exactly what
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
type of fee is what or what was intended
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
the issue is um like she just said it's
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
not whether they have the authority they
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
do they can't assess fees it's what type
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
of Feed the legislature authorize and
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear there are two types of
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
fees they're administrative or cost
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
recovery and then there are license fees
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
and that is for conditional privilege so
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
um you know in the court reporter
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
statute it's pretty clear that it is you
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
you can only practice you can only have
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
that title if you pay and you have a
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
license so there is also an application
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
fee that's listed in the statute but
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
they are different
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
I believe the the significant point is
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
that a license fee is refundable and an
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
application fee is not and the point the
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
oplc is making is that the the license
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
part of the fee is vanishingly small
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
compared to the cost recovery part of
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
which they consider an application fee
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
well they can certainly be transparent
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
with that in their rules and they're not
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
doing that now ah thank you yes Senate
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah I I guess I
 
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
have to say I I agree completely with
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
the oplc here I think we're making this
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
much more complicated than it needs to
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
be I mean if the if the
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
as I understand it correct me if I'm
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
wrong on this but the legislate first of
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
all on the issue of a conditional
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
privilege I mean I I guess I it's not
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
clear to me what license if if the law
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
requires you to have a license to do
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
whatever the business is presumably if
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
you you can't practice the business
 
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
without the license so I'm not sure that
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know trying to
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
trying to draw distinctions between one
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
type of license or another makes makes
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
sense but the other thing I guess I'm
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
really concerned about is
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
certainly the legislature if it wanted
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
to could could
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
draw distinctions between application
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
fees and license fees and say that one
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
is refundable and the other is now I
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
don't have any question that the
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
legislature could do that but as I
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
understand that the legislature hasn't
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
done that unless there's some particular
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
statute that I'm you know I'm
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
overlooking but the legislature hasn't
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
done that they've just sort of said you
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
can collect they've they've used
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
language like you know application
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
license fees administrative fees those
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of things Without Really indicating
 
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
that they intended to distinguish
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
between those some of the professions do
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
I mean each board is different that's
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
one of the issues we have and some of
 
00:43:51.609 --> 00:43:51.619 align:start position:0%
them do make distinctions between
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
application fees and license fees but
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's not all of them by any means
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
and the other issue is that uh for there
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
are some professions where the initial
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
licensure fee is significantly higher
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
than the renewal fee which indicates
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
that there's a major application
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
processing part of it
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done once but not again
 
00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done once but not again
yeah

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
um historically speaking the committee
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
and staff have always thought of a fee
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
for a license for the issuance of a
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
license is refundable if the license is
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
not issued where it says an application
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
fee doesn't talk about a license fee if
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
it says solely an application fee then
 
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:42.500 align:start position:0%
that is uh non-refundable
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
this situation is a little more
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
difficult because there are a number of
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
different statutes with the different
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
boards some say applications some say
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
license I I think the office is trying
 
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
license I I think the office is trying
to

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:59.569 --> 00:44:59.579 align:start position:0%
make things clearer and more uniform but
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
I think you may need statutory changes I
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
also think there's a little confusion
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
here in these rules because there's
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
reference to administrative fees I mean
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
personally from the history I've seen of
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the boards and their statutes an
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
administrator fee was only intended to
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
be minor administrative costs like a
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
licensee loses its wall certificate or
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
its damage and they want a new one so
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's a ten dollar fee for that in the
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
past people have been able to get a list
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
of licensees from a particular board
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
there may be a fee for processing that I
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think now it seems with these rules
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
dimensions of administrative fees seems
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
to be expanding
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
and throughout these proposals it
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
indicates that these fees are
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
non-refundable period and that does
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
include license fees
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
okay may I just ask one follow-up
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
question can I just make sure am I
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
understand are is there now in some of
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
these licensing statutes is there
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
specifically does has the legislature
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
said these fees are refundable
 
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
as a the legislature used that language
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
in some licensing statute
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain not that I know of no
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
and I think that's I think that's the
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
issue because
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
I could find No Authority for the
 
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.309 align:start position:0%
I could find No Authority for the
proposition

00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
proposition
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
that license fees are refundable and
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
application fees are not and I think the
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
materials cited by OLS support the
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
proposition and I'm quoting from the
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
memo when evaluating of Revenue law the
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
substance controls and not the labels so
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
this over simplistic distinction between
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
license fees and application fees
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
um it really has no bearing on whether
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
or not it's refundable or not I think
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
you have to undertake the analysis of
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
the cost recovery versus conditional
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
privilege in our position is that
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything that we do is cost recovery
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
because everything supports the
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
regulation of the profession now some
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
may be more towards the application
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
processing itself versus the regulation
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
which would include assistance with rule
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
making assistance with investigative
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
support and I do think that we can do a
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
much better job of distinguishing you
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
know which how much is going to what
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
type of function that it absolutely we
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
could do a better job and after we you
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
know continue to
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
assess costs and allocate them
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
um but but I I don't think that uh I
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
just disagree with with the simplified
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
distinction between license fees and
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to say um there is only one other
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
section representative
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
so this year the legislation
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
of surrounding House Bill 655 was that
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
oplc was going to have jurisdiction over
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
setting fees
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm thinking that there's no
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
conflict in any of the board statutes
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that HB 655 as amended
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
overrode or repealed all the authority
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
that boards have for setting fees I
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
believe I've some comments from the
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
staff on that one
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I just am a little confused actually
 
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how a person
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is reading
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
this the rules would know what fee is
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
refundable and what fee is not
 
00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:36.109 align:start position:0%
refundable and what fee is not
refundable

00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
refundable
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
um how would they know that if you don't
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
tell them
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
which fees refundable which fee is not
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
we do it's in the PLC 300s
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
we State explicitly
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
that you have to look at the 1002s to
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
determine what the fee and that the fee
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
is non-refundable Madam and chair if I
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
just because that was just a preamble to
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say you're okay so
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
then I think that and and the oh and the
 
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
reason for doing to for centralizing the
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
licensing process
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be the fees was to give a
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient and effective way of
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with licensing
 
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.750 align:start position:0%
dealing with licensing
and

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
therefore I think that that warrants an
 
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.349 align:start position:0%
therefore I think that that warrants an
examination

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
examination
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
as to how licenses are processed and
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
what part of the fee is refundable and
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
what part is not and I think because
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
we've brought in this amend this new
 
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
we've brought in this amend this new
statute

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
I think it takes it requires us because
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
this is a different way of doing things
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
it requires us to come up with as
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
efficient or effective way of handling
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
licensing or Administration fees and
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe what we're saying is that because
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
oplc takes on the burden of
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility when it issues are
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
licensed because it is looking at
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
different components of the requirements
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
of these licenses they take the burden
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
on and therefore that is where the the
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
main portion of fees are
 
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
main portion of fees are
found

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
or lie
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay director Morrow uh we have no issue
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
that the office of professional
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification has
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
authority to impose fees that's not a
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
question the question is what type of
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
fee is it and do they have authority to
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
I agree that we need to be more
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
transparent about this but I'm not sure
 
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.970 align:start position:0%
transparent about this but I'm not sure
that

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
the oplc is able to do that at this
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
point in time for all the professions
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are listed in this in this rule it
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
certainly would be
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
and for all those reasons I think that
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the legislative solution is what we need
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
to this and it's not going to happen
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
this year and therefore I move the item
 
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:14.540 align:start position:0%
second okay moved by Senator gray
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
Senator line any other comments
 
00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:22.609 align:start position:0%
Senator line any other comments
questions

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add a condition that the
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
oplc continue to work on clarifying
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
their fees the mission is a condition is
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
acceptable to my motion
 
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.630 align:start position:0%
acceptable to my motion
okay

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll uh
 
00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:41.300 align:start position:0%
just so you don't get bored and idle
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
okay I was worried
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
and does that include the previous
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
um rules that have been passed that
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
indicate that all fees are
 
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.710 align:start position:0%
indicate that all fees are
non-refundable

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
non-refundable
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
yes if they look at those rules and
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
decide that they have
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
that their first pass was overly broad
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
then yes they should go back and fix
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
them if as necessary
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
director Morrow I assume uh your
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
addition is either a recommendation or
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
all right seeing on the motion is to
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
prove the rule with the
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation that the oplc work on
 
00:52:28.319 --> 00:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation that the oplc work on
transparency

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
aye opposed no
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
that was Chamblee I think yeah Senator
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
Chandler all right thank you
 
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.450 align:start position:0%
Chandler all right thank you
okay

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
so we got one big issue out of the way
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
already but and now another one that I'm
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
sure the oplc is very happy to talk
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
about again
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um which is the retention policy that we
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
have brought up before
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
um so I won't get into what has been
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
said before what I do want to bring up
 
00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:07.819 align:start position:0%
is that in looking at HB
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
655 there was language added in four
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
places that require the oplc to retain
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
records in accordance with a retention
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
policy developed by the agency but it
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
does not state that it needs to be filed
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State as I know
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
that was an issue that the Secretary of
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
State specifically the director of
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
archives does not have rules with regard
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
to retention policies and what our
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
office's concern is is that this affects
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
the licensees or anyone else who is
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
looking for these records so it affects
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
the public at large so it should really
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
be in rules somewhere to ensure that
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
this is being
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
applied uh
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
even to all people evenly all boards
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
evenly additionally RSA 541a is the
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee may be aware specifically
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
states that you know if it is a rule it
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be written as a rule
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
um unless it is specifically exempt in
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
statute which we do not see an exemption
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the statutes here there is also case
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire that specifically
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
states that policies are not enforceable
 
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.750 align:start position:0%
states that policies are not enforceable
uh

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
the public cannot enforce the agency
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
cannot enforce it as it is just an
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
internal policy as opposed to a rule so
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
we would once again argue that this
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
retention policy should be written as a
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
rule and based on what we're seeing in
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
HB 655 that the oplc should
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
probably put those in rules themselves
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
and therefore would recommend that the
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
committee consider potentially a
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
petition for rulemaking regarding this
 
00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:47.329 align:start position:0%
petition for rulemaking regarding this
issue

00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
director Morrow
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
historically most agencies the boards
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
have had rules that say for example
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
the board shall retain records for all
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
records for three years unless otherwise
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
established by the director of archives
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 5 colon 30. where he
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
does have the he or she does have the
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
authority to establish requirements
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
regarding record retention I mean the
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
director could say
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
I want all agencies to retain records
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
for five years it's not necessarily
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
submitting those records to the director
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
of archives but at least uh
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
completing them as was indicated in this
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
instance there is no uh requirement
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
for a specific time or how to retain the
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
records the records are simply being
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
held pursuant to an outside document
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
by the agency but if I understand
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
correctly the issue is that the director
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
of archives has the authority to write
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
rules on this and has not yet done so
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
yes I spoke with the Secretary of State
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday morning he indicated a
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
willingness to meet and talk with that
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
in fact have a meeting with staff and
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
oplc if they wish to discuss the issue
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
but you are absolutely correct that uh
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
for decades the director of archives has
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
not had rules on this and if the
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee wished it could petition for
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
director Lindsay thank you um
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
for the record Lindsay Courtney
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
um so this is a carryover language from
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
what was in 310a that was added I I
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
believe one or two legislative sessions
 
00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:45.829 align:start position:0%
believe one or two legislative sessions
ago

00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.210 align:start position:0%
ago
and

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
um interacting it it was purpose we
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
purposely did not stay and according to
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
the rules adopted by 541a because we
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
believe that the rule making Authority
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
actually lies with the secretary of
 
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:57.589 align:start position:0%
actually lies with the secretary of
state

00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
and so we did follow the process even
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
though it's not enrolled took us over a
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
year to get approval from the Secretary
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
of State
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
um and we did adopt in a policy what was
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
approved by the Secretary of State's
 
00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:12.829 align:start position:0%
approved by the Secretary of State's
office

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and and specifically about archives
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to put this into rule but I
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
do think that that conflicts with their
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
Authority and I think if there is a
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
petition for rule making it really
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
should lie with the secretary of state
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
and not with the office
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay since you have a document from the
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that you're using it
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
incorporate by reference to the guidance
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State because like
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
that might
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's not their their document it's the
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's document
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
we can make it part of the record for
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
this rulemaking but it it's not
 
00:57:56.049 --> 00:57:56.059 align:start position:0%
something that can be at this point be
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
included as incorporation by reference
 
00:57:58.859 --> 00:58:01.609 align:start position:0%
included as incorporation by reference
okay

00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
that seems to me that that's
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
really they're referring to the guidance
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
they have been given by the agency that
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
has authority over that area
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we want the oplc to
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
make rules on this issue yeah my concern
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
is that such a letter from the Secretary
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
of State
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
telling or
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
indicating to oplc this is how you
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
should keep your records well the
 
00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:35.059 align:start position:0%
keeping of those records by the by oplc
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
I would say constitutes a rule because
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
it affects people outside
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
they may have their own requirements I
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
mean it should be someplace Incorporated
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
in a document that everyone can see
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you so again my concern as
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
we get into the same problem we had oplc
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
with boards had rights to make rules and
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
then the agency had right to make rules
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
and the rules were conflicting so my
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
concern is that if the agency adopts
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
rules that then goes and conflicts with
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
the archivist rules then we have you
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
know a constitutional issue which one is
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
the overriding regulation so I'm not
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
sure we're talking to the right person
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and that I think it's the archivist
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
that has the responsibility for setting
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
the retention rules for the state and
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
then the agency would be required to
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow that rule for retention so I
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
think we're kind of yelling at the wrong
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
person in the short term I think
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh the director has corrected
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
it by creating an internal policy until
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
the rules are adopted and I think
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
they've followed the right process so
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a recommendation to
 
00:59:37.559 --> 00:59:39.710 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a recommendation to
approve

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
represent their fellows
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
um my concern was along the same general
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
line is um what Senator Lang just said
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that the um
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
the retention policy is not
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily driven just by what the
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
archivist says it has to do with I think
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to have to do with like what
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
the material that you're dealing with
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
for example in education
 
01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:10.099 align:start position:0%
schools are responsible to to keep
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment information in perpetuity
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
so and if you if you have federal grants
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
you there's a requirement that you keep
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
certain pieces of information
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
for a certain length of time and then of
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
course anything that with licensing
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
there could be lawsuits so you want it I
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
would think you know statute of
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
limitations would apply so it it's not
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
like all of your information it can be
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
some of your information in the
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
retention policy could be different for
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
different pieces of it I don't think it
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
this whole issue doesn't lie just with
 
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:45.980 align:start position:0%
the architis
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
if I if I may Madam chair please the
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
policy that was approved by archives is
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
on our website and does describe the
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
different types of documents and have
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
different types of retention schedules
 
01:00:59.569 --> 01:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
based on the documents
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
and that information is in fact
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
available to the public yes it's on our
 
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
available to the public yes it's on our
website

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.530 align:start position:0%
website
okay

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
there's a motion in the second one okay
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
there are no no more discussion than the
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
motion is to approve the rule
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.329 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay court reporters um we've already
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
talked about the cost recovery versus
 
01:01:33.609 --> 01:01:33.619 align:start position:0%
license fee so I won't talk about that
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
however the fees do not match uh the
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
fees and this proposal say 155 for
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
initial reinstatement and renewal that's
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
a piece but the rules that you've just
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
approved previously for
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
2023-52 say 300 for initial and
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
reinstatement fees 204 renewal so
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're um so that's a problem that the
 
01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:04.220 align:start position:0%
fees do not match in this proposal
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
second there is just to point out to you
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
there is a 100 difference between the
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
initial and reinstatement fee of three
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
to the two hundred dollars for Renewal
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
so in this instance perhaps the um as
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
you stated chairwoman McGuire the the
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
cost recovery may be a hundred dollars
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
difference and so this proposal and the
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
rules that you just approved in 52 could
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
probably be amended to reflect that
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
um there's another issue and we've
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
already talked about at the retention
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
schedule so I won't spend any time on
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
that the next issue to bring to your
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
attention is there are some statutory
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
conflicts that will need to be addressed
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
in the next session and that's around
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
the term of licenses and we're seeing it
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
a lot with a lot of the initial
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
proposals that are coming in so the oplc
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
statute conflicts with the board
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
statutes the board statutes generally
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
say that the license that's expired
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
during the licensees birth month but the
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
oplc statute states that it expires
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
during the month of issuance so that's
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
probably going to be confusing for some
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
licensees they do have a notification on
 
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
their website about it but the committee
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
may want to know what Outreach has been
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
done beyond that notification so that
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
licensees aren't taken by surprise and
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
then lastly the link in the appendix is
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
not accurate so but that can be fixed at
 
01:03:37.329 --> 01:03:37.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
since Senator ward has left would you
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
like to replace a point somebody in the
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
replacement representative hacken
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
Phillips can sit in for Senator Ward
 
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.030 align:start position:0%
Phillips can sit in for Senator Ward
okay

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you I think there are two
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
issues here um the first regarding the
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
statutory conflicts we are very aware of
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
the statutory conflicts this is part of
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
um what will hopefully be another
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
cleanup effort in the next legislative
 
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.109 align:start position:0%
cleanup effort in the next legislative
session

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding the terms uh with 655s
 
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.490 align:start position:0%
um regarding the terms uh with 655s
passing

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
um I I believe it makes clear that all
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
licenses are slated to expire two years
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
after the date of issuance
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
um the way we've implemented this uh is
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
Forward Thinking obviously not changing
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
existing dates but changing them as they
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
are issued so upon renewal if they have
 
01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:32.900 align:start position:0%
always renewed on their birthday
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
assuming they were new on time they will
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
continue to always Renew on their
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
birthday because the last date of
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
issuance is their birthday
 
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
um in terms of communications to the
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
public we did send out an email blast we
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
also have posted this information I
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
believe on every board web page and we
 
01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:53.579 align:start position:0%
really haven't gotten a lot of inquiries
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
um or individuals confused about that
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
with respect to the first issue with the
 
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.470 align:start position:0%
with respect to the first issue with the
fees

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
honestly that I take uh responsibility
 
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
for this one uh the uh what we had
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
intended to do with the PLC 1002s is
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
really not changed or deviate from
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
existing fees at all
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
um because we what we were trying to do
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
is just get all the fees into one
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
document so we can avoid this whole
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
every board adopts a fee the prior fees
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
for for the court reporters when we
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
started working on this were 300 and 200
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
the 300 I believe was set in statute and
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why that was included
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
um but if you may recall two years ago I
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
had presented some fees for the board's
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
consideration that didn't go anywhere it
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
ended up becoming part of a discussion
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
with the SB 330 committee but we had
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
recommended modifying the fee for court
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
reporters to 155.
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
um so what I would suggest is that this
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
this rule really should just point to
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
the PLC 1002s and to the extent that
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything needs to be modified in the
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
future that we will make those
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
modifications in the 1002s so just to be
 
01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:07.309 align:start position:0%
modifications in the 1002s so just to be
clear

01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
um the fee is 155 and will you be
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
amending the um the rule set that was
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
just approved in 2020 352.
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
to indicate a 155p
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
so so I believe this this proposal
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
should be amended to reflect that it
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
that we are utilizing the fees set forth
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
in the PLC 1002s the PLC 1002s I believe
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
were just approved and included fee for
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
300 200. exactly which has always been
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
the fee for court reporters
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
um we will obviously
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
need to reament the PLC 1002s after
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
undertaking additional analysis
 
01:06:51.539 --> 01:06:52.190 align:start position:0%
undertaking additional analysis
um

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I suspect that those fees will
 
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative you had a question okay
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
anyone or Senator line so are you
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
suggesting that in in this one in 12 4 2
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
where it says applying for initial
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
license section three that says 155 we
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
should strike number three or have it
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
just reference 102 the other statute we
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
just and that would be the amendment you
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
would agree to exactly reference the
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
1002s pay the fee as described in 1002
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
all right we'll have some people
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
bouncing around looking for the rules so
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
I hope they're they're obvious move to
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
approve as amended for conditional
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
approval as I mentioned by Senator
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
Chandler I believe yeah Senator
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
Ennis all right any further comments
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
and if there is in fact a statutory fee
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
that we want to take add that to the
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
list of things we need to take a look at
 
01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.529 align:start position:0%
list of things we need to take a look at
okay

01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
Board of Podiatry
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
so this one
 
01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.030 align:start position:0%
so this one
um

01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
has the exact same comment about the
 
01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
has the exact same comment about the
licensing

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and that's the only issue that that's
 
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
so given that we've already had
 
01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:36.299 align:start position:0%
discussion ad nauseum on that I've moved
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
by reference Honorable in any comments
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none those in favor
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.249 align:start position:0%
 
Chandler

01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:00.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.809 --> 01:09:19.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
um just for the record
 
01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.010 align:start position:0%
um just for the record
um

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
I'm I believe that Senator Lang's motion
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
included conditionally approving the
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
rule to make the same insertion as in
 
01:09:38.289 --> 01:09:38.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the motion was to deal with the adoption
 
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
to change at number three to say the
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
fees were set by 1002 rather than have
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
the fee in the rule exactly thank you
 
01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:56.689 align:start position:0%
the fee in the rule exactly thank you
okay

01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay the only issue on this one is
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
actually that there were a couple
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
definitions that expired in 2006
 
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.669 align:start position:0%
definitions that expired in 2006
um

01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Nicole valenzola
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator for the
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair actually if I can bring
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
some clarification to this previously
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
the area agency had sectioned out their
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
definitions in a specific formatting
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
where each section
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
.01.02 was a different word
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
they are now reformatting and clumping
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
definitions based upon you know alphabet
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
so the section was was a previous word
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
that is no longer utilized and hasn't
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
been used and so the section was
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
reserved but per aarl language we have
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
to write expired but there isn't
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
actually expired language
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and the words that are now in that
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
section are new terms to be defined
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
so the previous word that was .02 is
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
cash account and that term isn't used
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
any longer and the new term now is I
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:15.140 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that the
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
definitions that expired in 2006 are no
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
longer used as such correct it was one
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
word in that section that hasn't been
 
01:11:23.159 --> 01:11:26.930 align:start position:0%
word in that section that hasn't been
used

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.370 align:start position:0%
 
expired

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
expired
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's been reserved I don't know for how
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
long that section so
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
indefinitely as far as I
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
so we you know we might have shot
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
ourselves there in the foot by even
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
saying it was expired but that's my
 
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.070 align:start position:0%
saying it was expired but that's my
fault

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
you know that's the only issue we'll do
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
a group exactly okay
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then I'm Madam chair I don't know I
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
had one that was pulled off consent
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
while I'm up here or I'm happy to go
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
back and sit and wait if you wanted
 
01:11:58.330 --> 01:11:58.340 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry one at a time
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I think we'll we'll deal with
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
the ones off consent last that's the
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
usual procedure all right do we have a
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
motion I already moved to approve oh
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
sentence sentence it has been moved and
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
approved moved and seconded to approve
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
the rule any further discussion comments
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
01:12:20.699 --> 01:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
opposed

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry for that
 
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:28.729 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry for that
interruption

01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:31.460 align:start position:0%
uh so the next is uh
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
2023-6 it's an expedited revision to
 
01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:35.930 align:start position:0%
2023-6 it's an expedited revision to
form

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
um there are two comments on this
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
particular proposal one's an unclear and
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
one is simply a note to the committee uh
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
both have to do with the fact that this
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
rule uh excuse me this form
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
was uh just amended back in 2022 through
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
the same process the expedited version
 
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:56.540 align:start position:0%
of form process
 
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:01.100 align:start position:0%
and in the notice the second
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
change it says that it's changing the
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
requirement from U.S citizen to Legal
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
resonated by the agency I could not see
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
that those uh Federal uh regulations had
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
been amended recently so I was not sure
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
why uh this change was happening now as
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to 2022
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and the other issue was
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
um as I said it's a note to jail car
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
because it's not a grounds for objection
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
however if the committee feels that this
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed they can certainly
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
do a petition for rulemaking but the
 
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
do a petition for rulemaking but the
form

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
um after it was mended in 2022 the rule
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
text was not updated to reflect the new
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
name of the form and the new edition
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
date as you can see from this rule uh
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
this proposal there are two rule
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
sections where this form is referenced
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
and both of them have the old name of
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
yes please good morning Allison radmay
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for family centered
 
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.850 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for family centered
services

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to uh address the note to
 
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:18.140 align:start position:0%
gel car with respect to the
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
inconsistency of the form title and
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
Edition date in the rule text on the Jen
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
import website
 
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.090 align:start position:0%
import website
um

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
I was no part
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
um involved in the 2022 revisions
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
however after looking through the
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
records in our office
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
um it has come to our conclusion that we
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
have not received the proofing copy
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
um that allows us to make those changes
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
on the actual rule text uh on the
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
genport website and we did make sure we
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
did not miss that so that's why that is
 
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.090 align:start position:0%
did not miss that so that's why that is
outstanding

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
outstanding
 
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
outstanding
um

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
isn't this something that the process
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
for expedited forms is supposed to
 
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:02.900 align:start position:0%
include that you update the reference
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
in the rule itself yes if there's no
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
substantive change then that can be done
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
editorially if there's a substantive
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
change created by the revision to the
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
form then they also have to go through
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
rule making for the text of the rule
 
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
I see so the in both cases there is in
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
fact a substantive change
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
in this instance yes then they would
 
01:15:32.649 --> 01:15:32.659 align:start position:0%
need regular rulemaking okay thank you
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
regarding the question about the federal
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
requirement it's not a it wasn't a
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
change in the federal requirement it's a
 
01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:50.179 align:start position:0%
clarification it refers to 42 USC
 
01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:51.729 align:start position:0%
clarification it refers to 42 USC
13950

01:15:51.729 --> 01:15:51.739 align:start position:0%
13950
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is part of the Medicaid
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
requirements the Social Security Act
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
references that individuals served must
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
also meet the requirements for that and
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
because the requirements include U.S
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
citizen or a legal resident alien alien
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
lawfully admitted for permanent
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
residents given the space we had
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
available on the form we felt that using
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
a legal resident of the United States
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
would cover both of those which is why
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
we chose that um
 
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.010 align:start position:0%
we chose that um

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
Security Administration is a broader
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
application than what this rule is what
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
went that then then the other
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
requirements is that correct that you're
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
broadening it
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
to fit with the Social Security
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
Administration so the title V funds that
 
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
are used to support the services
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
provided under this rule are issued
 
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
unallocated under the social Social
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
Security Act when we reviewed the ACT to
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were meeting all the
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
requirements in our application it
 
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
requirements in our application it
referenced

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
um also being in compliance with these
 
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rules when we cross-referenced
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
those that's when we
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
found that language
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not that we're broadening it I
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative yeah you know I I
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and my
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
only concern is um
 
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
if you I I certainly agree that a legal
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
resident includes a citizen but I'm
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if that term
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know if in other words if I just saw
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
the term legal somebody that that
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
um that maybe has some knowledge and if
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
I just saw the term legal resident I
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
might wonder if that includes a citizen
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
even though I even though I agree it
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
does I mean it just seems like
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't it be in terms of
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
sort of public understanding wouldn't it
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
be better to use both terms a U.S
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's just a suggestion
 
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.729 align:start position:0%
that's just a suggestion
okay

01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair uh because this is an
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
expedited revision to form I don't think
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
you can do a conditional approval
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's correct you either have to deny
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
and I I I would draw my you know do you
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
have a motion to approve yes I've moved
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lynn moves to
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
approve I'll second with the
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
edition of a request for rulemaking to
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
update the references in the rules that
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
refer to this form
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
can I actually clarify that with you
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
guys during the certification process
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
once we put a rule a former Vision
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
forward can't we amend the title in the
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
Edition date as part of the
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
certification process
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
if there's no other changes in the
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
but it would probably be editorial but I
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
think we would have to look because I
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
feel like that's how we've always done
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm just kind of confused yeah
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
well the
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
if there is a substantial a policy
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
change then we would want you to update
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
the rules that refer to this form
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
and you're saying there is not a policy
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
change no
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no change in the form that
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
would require uh complementary ruleming
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
no not other than the rule title and the
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
addition name and if I make I mean the
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
form title I believe this form is
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference is that
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
correct so there's no there's nothing in
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
the rule text that needs to be amended
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
except for the title and the Edition
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay so that could be an editorial
 
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.689 align:start position:0%
okay so that could be an editorial
change

01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay then I withdraw withdraw the
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
the request and just second the motion
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.250 align:start position:0%
any further discussion comments
questions

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.260 align:start position:0%

okay those in favor
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is the objection

um

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I have reviewed the
 
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
so I have reviewed the
um agency's

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%

um I
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
complied with the federal statute
 
01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.370 align:start position:0%
complied with the federal statute
um

01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and they did take into consideration
 
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.530 align:start position:0%
and they did take into consideration
stakeholder

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540 align:start position:0%

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.090 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
um

01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%

um
testimony

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
however there are actually a few typos
 
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.890 align:start position:0%
however there are actually a few typos
but

01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
I would like to go over
 
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.410 align:start position:0%
I would like to go over
um

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
there there some of them are definitely
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
typos that should be
 
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.669 align:start position:0%
typos that should be
um

01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.290 align:start position:0%
dealt with
so

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
it refers you from K to K and it should
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
be J which is the

um

01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
they should triple the original fine
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
for making the fine less
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the section above
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
and so I I don't know if they're
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
actually changing there's no way for
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
so that's just a little confusing there
 
01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.850 align:start position:0%
so that's just a little confusing there
um

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
um page 21 they have an extra and
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and then page 25 again they they
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
have a paragraph H that they're referred
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
on page 26
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're referring to K and they mean J
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
um and then they have a wrong citation
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
the G number three
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um K3 they're referring to G3 and it's
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually F3
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
so some of those need to be
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed just because so these
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
are these are generally editorial
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
yes they could they could do those
 
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
yes they could they could do those
editorially

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
editorially
 
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
editorially
um but

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's those were the only issues I
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
found so like they they appear to be um
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal statute
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and like I said they they did take
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
into consideration the concerns from
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
um stakeholders okay we have a request
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
for public testimony so uh
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam cheetah for the record
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Robert Clegg and I'm
 
01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.330 align:start position:0%
my name is Robert Clegg and I'm
representing

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
um Granite State case management
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about the letter
 
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Schmidt so we
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
um Sano today so this is the record so
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
you got to be really talking into the
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
microphone so they the record writer
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
will have even a chance at getting this
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
down so thank you thank you
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
um and again for the record my name is
 
01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
Robert Clegg I'm here representing
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
Greenwich case management and we're here
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
in response to the letter that came from
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
and I want to clarify a few things one
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
we had always thought from the beginning
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about case
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
management agencies because that's what
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
was on the on the rule however we see
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
here that they consider case management
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
agencies to include hospitals nursing
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
homes Home Health agencies assisted
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
living facilities residential
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation residential psychiatric
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
treatment substance abuse disorder
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
residential facilities non-emergency
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
walk-in Care Centers ambulatory surgical
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
centers and Stage renal dialysis centers
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
Community residents Adult Day Care
 
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
Centers and hospice care
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
we didn't agree until we saw it here we
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
agree now because we understand that
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's parity in the rates and the
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
rates paid to the hospitals for those
 
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.770 align:start position:0%
rates paid to the hospitals for those
Services

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:50.780 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
exceed what we get so we'll be doing a
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
right to know to make sure that
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
everybody's treated equally
 
01:26:58.139 --> 01:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
everybody's treated equally
however

01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have is that
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
rule that they're trying to do
 
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
is is not proper they're saying that
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
there is no CMS
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
intervention and rules than there is CMS
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
has a law has a rule that says if you
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
have case management licensing everybody
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
has to be licensed you can't go
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly and decide oh yes for this
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
one and know for that one it's either
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
we also want to want you to understand
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
what a case management does
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
case management doesn't just say to a
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
patient here's what you're going to do
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the reasons that we've
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
always had a problem with area agencies
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
is when you're the one providing the
 
01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:45.950 align:start position:0%
is when you're the one providing the
service

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
and then you're the one that determines
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not you provided that service
 
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.930 align:start position:0%
whether or not you provided that service
correctly

01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a problem
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
case management agencies such as Granite
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
State case management
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
has always been the one that says to the
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
state the client doesn't need that
 
01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:01.970 align:start position:0%
state the client doesn't need that
service

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times they say you're being
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
billed for service that the client's not
 
01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.390 align:start position:0%
billed for service that the client's not
receiving

01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
so it's actually the eyes and the ears
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the state and helps to keep us from
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
paying for things that are never done
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
it also stops a a patient or a client
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
from not getting the services that the
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
absolute absolutely positively need
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
now we also see that
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
they say that New Hampshire is under a
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
new plan of of Correction
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the same plan and correction
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
that they've been trying to do
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
in the legislature bill after Bill in
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
the last two years has said no to
 
01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:45.860 align:start position:0%
and we find it insulting that day before
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're out of session
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
they put in an emergency rule
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
and for the record I know that an
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
emergency rule becomes the law whether
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
you like it or I like it so basically
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's another usurpation of the
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative of how to run
 
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.810 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative of how to run
things

01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have shown up every single time the
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked us to comment
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
we show up at this committee to make
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody understands how we
 
01:29:17.639 --> 01:29:18.709 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody understands how we
feel

01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
and we fee again insulted only one
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
person showed up
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
well you know we we have work to do too
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
we showed up at gel car it doesn't take
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
all of us it just takes some of us to
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
let you understand where we are
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
and where we are right now is
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
Joe Carr needs to somehow find a way to
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
stop the Department of Health and Human
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
Services from creating constant law even
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
after the legislature says no to what
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to assist by filing
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
something next year that says if you
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
can't get gel Carr to say yes it's a no
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
there has to be some kind of legislative
 
01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
oversight and they should not be allowed
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
to wait to the last minute and say yeah
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
thanks a lot I was here in 94.
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I remember what they used to say
 
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
they used to say fine well wait till you
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
go home in the summer and we'll do it in
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
Rule and for years we stop them from
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
doing that and what I see now is I see
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
an arrogance
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
that basically says to the gel car
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee and the entire legislature we
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't really care what you think you may
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
be elected but we're the bureaucrats and
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it anyways
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to to not approve this
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
rule I understand it's going to go
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
through whether we like it or not
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
because you can't even stop that
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
but we need to say no and and we'll be
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
back again in January
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
and and we'll fight again
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
but we're asking for your help and we're
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
asking for you to act as the elected
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
representatives thank you
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with any legislative
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to deal to deal with it this
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
year could you clarify what part of this
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
you think is against legislative intent
 
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
well there's been numerous bills Senate
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 333 talked about licensing we've
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
had the argument in in the Committees
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember which Committee in
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
the senate in the house they were but
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
but the legislature decided that we were
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
correct the legislature has consistently
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
agreed that CMS does have the ability to
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
say if you license one you have to
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
license all
 
01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
01:31:33.179 --> 01:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
um so so
um

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
I'll stand corrected if it wasn't Senate
 
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 333 but it was a bill this year
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
um that we put in that you have to be
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
licensed so we've covered ourselves
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
constantly so
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
who needs to be licensed
 
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
anybody in case management needs to be
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
licensed everybody it's either that or
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
nobody is licensed but the law requires
 
01:31:58.570 --> 01:31:58.580 align:start position:0%
that anybody providing case management
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be licensed and this rule
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
apparently says that if you're licensed
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
as a hospital you can do case management
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
on the side
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
is that the issue that you're dealing
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
with according to what DHHS is saying
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
all of these people are doing case
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
I want to pitch in go ahead
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
no I'm I would agree I mean you
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself I apologize I'm Emily
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
Johnson I'm with granite case management
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
um thanks for for hearing me this
 
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.629 align:start position:0%
um thanks for for hearing me this
morning

01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
was I don't have much clarification
 
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.669 align:start position:0%
was I don't have much clarification
honestly

01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:32:37.679 --> 01:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
honestly
um

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:45.610 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
um the emergency rule which is this is
 
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:52.580 align:start position:0%
not the emergency rule
 
01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
this is the general rule on case
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
management agencies and I believe the
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
emergency rule does require everyone
 
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
license not license but right it's not
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
just going to be the area or agencies
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's anyone providing services
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
there is uh Carolyn virtue Granite case
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
management there is a statute
 
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.490 align:start position:0%
management there is a statute
um

01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
I believe that's RSA 1 51
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
e colon B1 but I may have that citation
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
off that requires licensure of case
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
management agencies
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
beginning on July 1st through yesterday
 
01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:48.260 align:start position:0%
the department has enrolled over 30
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
individuals or entities to deliver case
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
management two of them are licensed CMS
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
requires that if state law or rule
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
requires licensure that in order to
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
enroll a provider the department must
 
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
verify that that licensure exists
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
the department did not do that
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
licensing providers as required
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to have an exemption
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
in this rule
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
but there's no statutory basis for it
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you director Morrow
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
um I just want to let everyone know the
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
committee and the public that this is an
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
objection response so the committee has
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
the choice of approving the rule
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
entering a final objection and or joint
 
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.370 align:start position:0%
entering a final objection and or joint
resolution

01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:54.380 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that's basically it unless the
 
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
agency requests a revised objection and
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
any further basis for objection has to
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
be based on what the committee's
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
objection was to the final proposal
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
which was there was in part well there
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
was staff annotations and the War uh
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislative intent to the extent that
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
the rules were unclear
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
so does this rule conflict with the
 
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.669 align:start position:0%
so does this rule conflict with the
statute

01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe that it does but I I
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
agency may be able to explain it a
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
and to qualify what I just said yes if
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
the agency in changing the language in
 
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
the ejection response from the final
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
proposal create a new basis for
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
objection and certainly the committee
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
can take that into consideration
 
01:35:54.239 --> 01:35:59.090 align:start position:0%
can take that into consideration
okay

01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
I think so unless there's any questions
 
01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
I think so unless there's any questions
well

01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
well we will hear from the agency next
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Mr Clegg no
 
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ask one question yes Bob
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
so having read what the agencies reviled
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
it after our original objection
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
does the same situation still exist
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
where we're dealing with agencies
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
providing care also saying that they're
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
providing care properly and there's no
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
is that problem still exists that's been
 
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
something that they're trying to do it
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
still exists yes thank you I I want to
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
clarify what I said though you have to
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
understand that the Department of Health
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
and Department of Health and Human
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
Services I'm sorry Peter
 
01:36:52.090 --> 01:36:52.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
continuously tries to say to CMS that
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
there are no licensed case managers with
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
conflict-free abilities in the state of
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now there were two with
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
over 40 years experience
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
so while they keep telling the federal
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
I would like it may ask representative
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like clarification on
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
that Senate bill number because Senate
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 333 does concern case management
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
but it was passed by the house in the
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senate so I don't I'd like I don't
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
really understand your
 
01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
the intent we amended out the parts that
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
they have in here we amended out the
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
ability for them to allow unlicensed
 
01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.090 align:start position:0%
ability for them to allow unlicensed
people

01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
and there was another bill as well it's
 
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you madam
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair my question is regarding the
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
section that is deleted in this response
 
01:38:00.169 --> 01:38:00.179 align:start position:0%
it was deleted section F which Exempted
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
all entities who provide Service
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
Coordination to individuals receiving
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
developmental disability services or
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorders by making that

from the scope of work which is what we
did

01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're responding to in
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony prior to me it was
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
asserted that the Department of Health
 
01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services considers
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes Home Health
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
agencies assisted living facilities the
 
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
reason that we exempt these facilities
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
they are already licensed and regulated
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so if we
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
are asking now for every single licensed
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
agency to be licensed for every service
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
they provide you now will have hospitals
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes assisted living facilities
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
having more than one license and having
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of visits from us and also in our
 
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:06.530 align:start position:0%
a lot of visits from us and also in our
opinion

01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
and has been a long-standing policy or
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is not to
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
over regulate individuals rather we
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
review all of the services and programs
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
for each licensed facility
 
01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
to the point so if I understand you
 
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
correctly your interpretation of the
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
license all or none is that these
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
individuals are licensed as
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
say a home
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
hospital and case management is one of
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
their their license functions and they
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
have a lab and they don't need a lab
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
license so hospitals would need many
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
licenses for all the services they
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
probably provide as with nursing homes
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
add with as would assisted living
 
01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
add with as would assisted living
facilities

01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful say 151 colon 2-b is
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
not referenced in this rule however it
 
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
says all licensed Healthcare entities
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
would it help to clarify that the RSA
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
that that that facilities with case
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
management agencies license under 151
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
colon 2B are Exempted would that would
 
01:43:26.649 --> 01:43:26.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so all licensed Health Care
 
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.609 align:start position:0%
okay so all licensed Health Care
entities

01:43:30.609 --> 01:43:30.619 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
licensed pursuant to RSA 151 colon 2-b
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
is that what you're suggesting
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm afraid that I might kick
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
something out as well but if you
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
included one you have all licenses a is
 
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:45.860 align:start position:0%
all facilities listed in RSA 151 colon 2
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
comma two a through I but if you added
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
one that includes all facilities listed
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
um all facilities providing case
 
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
management licensed under 151 colon 2
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dash B that would make sure that all of
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
those groups do not need to pursue
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
another license but we're clarifying
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
that anybody who falls within that is
 
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
exempt from this case management license
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
so iding other services that require
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
licensure so we'd have to go back and
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
take a look at that too but I think we
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
could probably make a clarification on
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
that I
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate that I think that'd
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
help a lot thank you Senator Lang
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I guess my my stumbling block here is
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that while I recognize they
 
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
have a specific license that's more of a
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
global license that deals with it my
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
question is there anywhere else in rules
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that requires to make sure that they
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
also follow these guidelines for
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
um or the or the guidelines for
 
01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
um or the or the guidelines for
um

01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
case management agencies is there
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
something that says that while you have
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
a license that's up here you also have
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're following these
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
rules because basically I I don't want
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
the fox guard in the hen house right
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
without some sort of Regulation that
 
01:44:59.689 --> 01:44:59.699 align:start position:0%
deals with that and to a certain extent
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
that's my concern right is that I want
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that yeah you may be able
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
to allow to provide Case Management
 
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
Services because of your Global license
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
but understand there's some firewall
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
rules you have to deal with to make sure
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
that the auditing and all that work is
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
done properly and is that in place yes
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and your
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
comments and yes all of our rules like a
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
hospital is a good example but also I
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
mean they're also CMS certified and or
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
accredited from different accrediting
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
agencies so they have a great deal of
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
oversight but they um the hospital rules
 
01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.470 align:start position:0%
oversight but they um the hospital rules
also

01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
um talk to all of the different types of
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
services Radiology Cardiology I mean all
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
of the services they provide and what
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
quality measures are in place to ensure
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that patients are safe and healthy yes
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure my concern is all I
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
understand there may be Federal
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
Regulation we're talking about state
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
regulations Case Management Services and
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
so my question again is
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
do they have to
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
abide by the same regulatory same state
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
requirements because they hold that that
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
larger license that and that a smaller
 
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
agency that may only do Case Management
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
Services also has to abide by to make
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
sure that there's that firewall of of
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
services that there's not cross bleeding
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
over from oversight so RSA 151 I'm not
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure which particular section
 
01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.270 align:start position:0%
sure which particular section
um

01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
is titled deemed licensed so hospitals
 
01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:33.260 align:start position:0%
again are not a really good example but
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals are deemed licensed because
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
they are certified by CMS so I have a
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
CMS team and then I have a State
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
Licensing team and then there's the
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
external to the state agency a a
 
01:46:49.129 --> 01:46:49.139 align:start position:0%
crediting agency of the Hospital's
 
01:46:49.139 --> 01:46:50.169 align:start position:0%
crediting agency of the Hospital's
Choice

01:46:50.169 --> 01:46:50.179 align:start position:0%
Choice
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
they are deemed licensed which means it
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
is expected that they are compliant with
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
everything that's in state law and state
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
rule but they're overseen by the feds
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it's just presumed always that the
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations are more stringent
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
than the state regulations if there's a
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
contradiction there then our licensing
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
team gets involved or the accrediting
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
agency we also have a regional office in
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
Boston that works with us on that too
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
but again hospitals may not be a really
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
good example because they're very
 
01:47:25.729 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
they're different so but nursing homes
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
we would make sure that both our
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
licensing team and our CMS team are
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that they are compliant with
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
rules and law federal
 
01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.350 align:start position:0%
rules and law federal
state

01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:39.340 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a horrendous mess
 
01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:41.209 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a horrendous mess
[Music]

01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that means well
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
it means that we have Federal
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
requirements and federal regulations and
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
state rules and regulations and they
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
interact with each other
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to note that
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
the comments that were made prior to my
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
coming up here there is a discussion
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
about payment mechanisms and an
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
emergency rule that's separate from
 
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
licensing New Hampshire statute requires
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
licensure for facilities that provide
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
certain services so our Bureau oversees
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
that licensing and to the point that the
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that were identified on July 1
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
not being licensed they are in fact in
 
01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
the process of becoming licensed
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
license you can't list them as licensed
 
01:48:34.139 --> 01:48:35.330 align:start position:0%
license you can't list them as licensed
entities

01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
so they're not listed as licensed
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
entities they're in the process the
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
activity whatever system changed
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
effective July 1. if we were to say as a
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
state all of these individuals that are
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
receiving services from this handful or
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
less case management agencies that
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
effective 7-1 required a license prior
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
to 7-1 they didn't require A license
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
they require a license we're actively
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
working with them to get them licensed
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
if we were to stop their services then
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
all of those individuals would no longer
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
have services
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
so we're working in good faith to have
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I want to also point out that the
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
is a very large agency so to think that
 
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
licensing is responsible for everything
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's hap I mean I I guess sometimes I
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
get lost in in the com and I'm sorry
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
this isn't time for me to I'll stop but
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Peter
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
director Morrow if uh if any further
 
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
change were to be made as suggested by
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon because this is an
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
objection response the agency would have
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
to request a revised objection
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
which would end up back before Joe
 
01:50:02.699 --> 01:50:08.450 align:start position:0%
which would end up back before Joe
Kerrigan

01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
does the agency wish to request that
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
they're thinking representative
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering whether or not we're
 
01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:18.659 align:start position:0%
just making this too complicated
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this is as big of a
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
mess as it is because whenever you bring
 
01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
in intentions and
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
you you uh have
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
two organizations that obviously don't
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
agree then that's going to create a mess
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
in itself so I just think we need to
 
01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
look at it as a
 
01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:39.950 align:start position:0%
look at it as a
um

01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
strictly on a merit basis
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
if that if that's helpful okay well then
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
it would does the agency agree to put a
 
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
revised objection response
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
that would incorporate the
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
clarifications that representative Leon
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes we agreed to that okay then
 
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.390 align:start position:0%
yes we agreed to that okay then
yes

01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um I I just
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that with this in
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
process you'll still be able to get the
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
area the get those people licensed that
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed in order to provide
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
care to this community
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
because the process by the time we're
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
back here and we approve that with that
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
condition they'll already be in that
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
process of Licensing and it doesn't move
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
faster than that does it yeah and and to
 
01:51:28.729 --> 01:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
correct it's not area agencies that are
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the process of being licensed because
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're exempt it's those agencies that
 
01:51:35.209 --> 01:51:35.219 align:start position:0%
were part of F that we had initially put
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
in and the first objection that we're
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
here to discuss today we removed that
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
um so those are the agencies that we are
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
actively working on becoming licensed
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
so the delay would not interfere with
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
that process that's correct okay
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you in that case
 
01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
um we have the agency has requested a
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
revised objection response do we need to
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
vote to to accept it
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
well there's um there's another option
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
um you you could approve this and then
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
come back through with rulemaking for
 
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
that one section
 
01:52:20.689 --> 01:52:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
if the agency is is willing which well
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
which is the least trouble for everybody
 
01:52:27.179 --> 01:52:36.430 align:start position:0%
which is the least trouble for everybody
involved

01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
yeah I would yeah it would be to approve
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
this and start again on regular
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so we can at least get these
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
changes in place
 
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'll move to do that to to approve this
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
um intention of uh correcting the taking
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
into account the measures representative
 
01:53:07.330 --> 01:53:07.340 align:start position:0%
Leon suggested I'll second okay
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Liam and I I do want to
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that this is a clarification so
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
that there's not misinterpretation that
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
this rule is already intended to cover
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
anybody licensed under the one a 151
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
colon 2B and the simple the rule change
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:30.380 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sir
 
01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to approve the rule
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:53:43.689 --> 01:53:43.699 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay Senator Lang is opposed
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.239 --> 01:53:53.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.699 --> 01:53:59.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the next item on the list the
 
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
objection response for 20 23.89
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
um we have not received that response
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
yet but they have not met their deadline
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
their deadline is until July 31st so
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
they still have a little more time okay
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
we will not do anything on that then
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.649 --> 01:54:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so with regard to 2023 106 this was a
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
late filed final proposal that did get a
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
waiver for the um
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
final proposal deadline I had three
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
comments on it that have already been
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
discussed the fee issue the retention
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
policy issue and then the uh renewal
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
date issue have all already been
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
addressed so I had no further comments
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
yes we're we're in the discussion period
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
And I have a question
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh I had some public comment that the
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
this board had recently increased its
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements and do
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
you are you familiar with that and do
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know what the statutory Authority is
 
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
I believe that it could be referring to
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
a Respiratory Care not Medical Imaging
 
01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.709 align:start position:0%
a Respiratory Care not Medical Imaging
um

01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
they do have statutory authority over
 
01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
continuing education or the office does
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
because it's an Advisory Board we did
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
recently have a meeting a public meeting
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
on June 8th to discuss this issue
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
um interestingly I think stakeholders
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
are mixed about how many hours should be
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
required but I think the consensus was
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
that the increase in continuing
 
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
education should not apply to this
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
upcoming renewal cycle
 
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:17.810 align:start position:0%
upcoming renewal cycle
um

01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
so we do plan to Institute rulemaking to
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
on board
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions comments
 
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions comments
okay

01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
the motion is to approve the rule
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:56:36.719 --> 01:56:38.750 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Chandler vote snap okay
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair the next item under our
 
01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
hem 504
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
staff has looked at this to see whether
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
there does exist a basis for an
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
emergency Rule and it appears based on
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
the filing from the Department that it
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
meets both the requirements for imminent
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
apparel to imminent Peril to Public
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
Health or safety as well as
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
a potential significant risk of
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
financial impact to the state but that
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
can certainly be further explained by
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
Melissa Nemeth an attorney with the
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and hem 504 is a new rule for a
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
provider and provider agency operations
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
as we have discussed here in the context
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
of some other rules lately the
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
department has been under a corrective
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
action plan with CMS that we needed to
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
comply with by July 1st that included a
 
01:58:08.450 --> 01:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
few different elements some of the key
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
elements where the department needed to
 
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
ensure that providers of Developmental
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
Services were able to Bill Medicaid
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
directly because historically there had
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
only been the 10 area agencies had been
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
the only enrolled Medicaid providers and
 
01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
they had contracted out with service
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
providers so that was one element that
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
needed to be corrected as well as
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
ensuring that services to individuals
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
are free from conflict and so that was
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
as a I said the department needed to be
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
in compliance with these requirements by
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
July 1st this has been
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
coming into compliance with the
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan has been multiple
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
years in the making
 
01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
um but this
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
we kind of couldn't get to this final
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
stage we had to First ensure that we
 
01:58:59.689 --> 01:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
stay with the area agencies and what
 
01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:01.940 align:start position:0%
roles we're going to transfer to
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
Providers directly and so that work was
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
still being done up until a few months
 
01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.310 align:start position:0%
still being done up until a few months
ago

01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
the contract with area agencies needed
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
to be revised to distinguish their
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
functions and so that is some of the
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
reason that this was coming as an
 
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
emergency Rule and there was not a Time
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
previously to go through the regular
 
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:25.580 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
we we did send the department sent this
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
out to a draft of this emergency rule
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
out to uh it wasn't labeled as an
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
emergency rule a draft of the rule was
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
sent out to relevant stakeholders at the
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
beginning of May and asked them gave
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
them a month and asked them to get back
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
to us with any comments it was made
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
clear to them at the time that due to
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
the timing you know it was likely that
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
critical elements might need to be
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
implemented via an emergency rule the
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
department received a significant amount
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
of feedback and in fact was able to
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate a lot of that into the
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
emergency rule that you see before you
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
today and we are working as we speak on
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
the the regular rule to get this to make
 
02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:14.540 align:start position:0%
sure there are no gaps
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
to address the points that attorney
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
Morrell had brought up the imminent
 
02:00:24.290 --> 02:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
Peril piece as I said previously area
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
agencies contracted with providers so
 
02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
via that contract they had what we refer
 
02:00:32.689 --> 02:00:32.699 align:start position:0%
to as like a screening process or a
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
vetting process for these providers they
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
oversaw their operations and were able
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
to do the billing
 
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
those are important pieces that needed
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be overseen by someone they couldn't
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
there could not be a gap in services so
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
the imminent Peril is at if there were
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for any oversight or
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
enrollment of these providers we
 
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have standardization and that
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
could put people at risk if there were
 
02:00:59.930 --> 02:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
no standards these people to provide the
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
services as far as the financial concern
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we were not to be in compliance with
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan by the first
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
of July the state was at significant
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
risk of losing its 50 Medicaid match for
 
02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:17.780 align:start position:0%
these Services
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
which would then mean one of two things
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
the funds would need to come strictly
 
02:01:24.649 --> 02:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
from General funds that had not been
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
allocated which could be a significant
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
cost or if those funds were not
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
available it would mean that these folks
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
then would necessarily go without the
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
services again speaking to the imminent
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
Peril that this could have put
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
individuals in for so for those reasons
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
on the department felt that it was
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to go forward with the
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
when were you put under a corrective
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
action plan how long ago was that
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
I believe it was in 2017.
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
so seven years ago I believe that's
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
accurate yes
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
and we have to have an emergency rule
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
for something you knew about seven years
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
ago and we kind of anticipated that
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
question um and as I said it was this
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
has been worked on all of the steps to
 
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with the corrective
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
action plan have been in process since
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
that time
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but this this piece about what were
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
the requirements for these providers of
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
services going to be decoupling that
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
from area agencies which where it had
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
been a part of what they had done and
 
02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
contracted for we had to First make sure
 
02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
we understood what the functions of the
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
area agency were going to remain before
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
we could determine what they were how
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
they were going to
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
transfer to provider agencies and that
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
work has the the stakeholder uh work
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to that has been extremely
 
02:02:51.370 --> 02:02:51.380 align:start position:0%
robust there are a multitude of
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and advisory councils that
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
had been working on that and
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
those functions that are going to remain
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
with area agencies I you may or may not
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
have seen we have filed an initial
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
proposal of hem 505 so some elements are
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
there and then the elements
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
that are not yet adopted in the rule
 
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
we're in the contract with between the
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
department area agencies which was just
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
finalized and approved by governor and
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
council at the end of June so cut all
 
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
these things were kind of converging on
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
the same time frame
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
hello follow up so I guess my question
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
is in here it talks about July 1 which
 
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
we've already passed and what does that
 
02:03:32.689 --> 02:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
mean for services that have been
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
provided between July 1 and now that
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
we're out of compliance because we
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
haven't adopted no this is an emergency
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
rule it went into effect right oh it's
 
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:44.219 align:start position:0%
already been in effect yes on June 28th
 
02:03:44.219 --> 02:03:46.129 align:start position:0%
already been in effect yes on June 28th
yes

02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
and another another complication is that
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
there was the contracts between the area
 
02:03:53.689 --> 02:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
agencies and the provider agencies that
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
were through the end of June to provide
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.099 --> 02:04:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent Bland thank you
 
02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for getting these
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
rules out I think that this is a large
 
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
reason why as we have the different
 
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
bills coming through on this we were
 
02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
really encouraging the department to
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
seek another waiver so that we could go
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
through this rulemaking process in a
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
more measured and um and noticed way
 
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that that is why
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
we had sought why we had encourage the
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
department to seek another waiver so
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
that we weren't coming in at the last
 
02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
minute I appreciate the work that you've
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
done but but I'd like to see more more
 
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.450 --> 02:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.219 align:start position:0%
I do have one comment because I've I've
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
heard from the
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh case management agencies that they
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
believe they are stakeholders in this
 
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
process and they were not consulted
 
02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
during this this rulemaking
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you have any comments on
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is that those
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
entities that are providing services
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we're providing services to this
 
02:05:04.729 --> 02:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
community and now we're part of what who
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
would be regulated under here were
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
included I do not have the list in front
 
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
of me specifically but my understanding
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%
is that it went out to a very very broad
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know specifically which
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
agencies were included
 
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
it was primarily those who are currently
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the business well and so to speak and
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
this would this rule is for providers
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
both if they're providing direct service
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
and Service Coordination so it went out
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
to Providers of both of those types of
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
services but if they if an agency was
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
not already providing those services to
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
this community they may not have been
 
02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
included in the in that stakeholder
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
Outreach because it wasn't known to the
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
department they were the regulated
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
Community thank you
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
anyone else questions comments all right
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
Direction More wrong
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the Department of
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
Safety under other business we still
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
have I believe two final proposals
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
remaining that we're taking off consent
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:18.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:18.250 --> 02:06:18.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:23.570 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
um

02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
okay so um last time the committee had
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
approved the driver's licensing rules
 
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
and requested that the department of
 
02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:33.179 align:start position:0%
safety report back on its internal
 
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
policy to ensure that forms are not
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
updated outside the rulemaking process
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
they had adopted this policy last year
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and are slowly going through each rule
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
set to look at those forms but um you
 
02:06:48.370 --> 02:06:48.380 align:start position:0%
should have as part of your packages
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Steve Lavoy assistant
 
02:06:57.169 --> 02:06:57.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the department of safety
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and with me is John rasco the director
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
so um the letter that was presented to
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
you was really addressing three
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions that came up during uh the
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
adoption of the 1000 rules the first
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
being how we're addressing the forms uh
 
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
issues that we've identified
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost I want the
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
committee to know the commissioner and I
 
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
both want the committee to know that we
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of having forms
 
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
go through rulemaking it's critical
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
um it's what we're doing at this point
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
is taking an inventory of all of our
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
approved forms and reconciling those
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
against those that are currently in use
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
to identify what those gaps are and what
 
02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
that population is once we've identified
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
that population that needs to be
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted will be determining if there's
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
substantive changes or if there are
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
editorial changes and incorporate those
 
02:07:53.689 --> 02:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
into our current rule making schedule as
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
needed based on that risk assessment so
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
we're working through the process we do
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
ask for your patients because we have a
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
lot of rule sets to go through a lot of
 
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
forms to go through I don't think every
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
form in the department of safety D has
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
an issue we don't know how many
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but the ones that are we will address
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible
 
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
another question that came up had to do
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
with um
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
actually I think it was representative
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
Leon related to um
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
suspended driver's licenses and whether
 
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
those needed to be suspend um
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
surrendered to the department
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
um that's a situation where uh a few
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
years back the department worked with
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
the legislature to
 
02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
um become part of state to state and
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments to statute related
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
to how suspended licenses are handled
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
we thought collaboratively that we had
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
addressed all the changes that were
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
necessary in statute but it turns out
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
there were sections that were missed
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
during that process and that's the
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
situation that we're dealing with here
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
so we have a group of individuals when
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
their license is suspended that do not
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
need to surrender however there is a
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
group that fall under some categories
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
some exemptions to that including the
 
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspensions the
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
ALS process that do need to suspend or
 
02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.570 align:start position:0%
ALS process that do need to suspend or
Surrender

02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:10.580 align:start position:0%
Surrender
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the DMV staff were telling
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
everyone they didn't they no longer
 
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
needed to surrender that was a that was
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
a missed change in that legislative
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
process will be working internally to
 
02:09:24.649 --> 02:09:24.659 align:start position:0%
determine what needs to be changed
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
through legislative changes and work
 
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
finding a sponsor in the next session to
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
see about whether or not the legislature
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
align both of those processes together
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the key there is the the big
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
difference in the driver license is not
 
02:09:41.689 --> 02:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
only a credential that authorizes you
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
the privilege to drive but also is used
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
as an ID now and so that's why not
 
02:09:48.169 --> 02:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
surrendering it seems to be something
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we would want to consider
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then the third question was
 
02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn it was related to a
 
02:09:57.290 --> 02:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
question on non-resident pistol permits
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and there was a Supreme Court decision
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
that indicated that the rules and the
 
02:10:02.810 --> 02:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
forms that we were using were no longer
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
valid when that decision came forward we
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
did go through the normal form approval
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
process adjusted the forms and those
 
02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
have been in place since that time but
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out the rules themselves
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
were not cleaned up to eliminate the
 
02:10:19.689 --> 02:10:19.699 align:start position:0%
language that was no longer necessary
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
that change has since been filed with
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
the next rule set that was submitted I
 
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
want to say maybe a week or so ago and
 
02:10:29.209 --> 02:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
so those were the three questions that
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
we were reporting back on and we're
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that the
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
those clarifications I'd be happy to
 
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
talk with you about the legislative
 
02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:45.980 align:start position:0%
changes thank you thank you okay
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
and I do have that
 
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
um those pistol rules okay we have the
 
02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:54.410 align:start position:0%
um those pistol rules okay we have the
um

02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:56.410 --> 02:10:56.420 align:start position:0%
we have the initial proposal
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lim sure
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
um it's uh if I understand correctly it
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
from your letter it sounds like
 
02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
the form was changed back in 2017 but
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
the language and the rule
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
has not actually yet been changed I mean
 
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's in the works but it hasn't actually
 
02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:16.490 align:start position:0%
it's in the works but it hasn't actually
come

02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
come to us is that correct yes correct
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
that um so that's
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
since that decision was made and
 
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
I have to say honestly that's very
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
concerning this is something that sort
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
of concerns a constitutional right
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
uh implicates a constitutional right uh
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
under the Second Amendment and you know
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
the court issues a decision
 
02:11:47.209 --> 02:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
and seven years later the language in
 
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
the uh in the rule that the court has
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
struck down is you know is has not yet
 
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
been changed
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
that that's a concern that's really a
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
concern that this that that goes on for
 
02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
either that or the department has been
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
ignoring their rules for seven years
 
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
well yeah I understood and I share that
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
concern and just to alleviate it um the
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
form is really what's uh the the the
 
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism to provide these resident
 
02:12:23.089 --> 02:12:23.099 align:start position:0%
these non-resident permits so the result
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the decision has been effectively
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
implemented correctly the only thing
 
02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been is the the cleanup of
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
those rules behind it so there hasn't
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
been any any issue with the
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
implementation of the program after that
 
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
decision was made but I agree though
 
02:12:43.810 --> 02:12:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
I mean I hope that's true but I guess
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know the thing that I'm that would
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
be of concern to me is if I'm if I'm
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
if I'm someone in New Jersey as you know
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
I use New Jersey because that was where
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
that person came from in the in the bot
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
case but if I'm someone in New Jersey
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
um who wants to get a New Hampshire
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
non-resident pistol permit
 
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
argue and and if I'm someone that maybe
 
02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
is you know uh it wants to be a sort of
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
a thorough person it might be that the
 
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
first thing I would do is look up the
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
regular the law and the regulations in
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and when I read the
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
regulations I would see that
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
nothing has you know that that it still
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
contains that language which is was
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
unauthorized so
 
02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
that that's I mean I'm glad I'm glad
 
02:13:35.209 --> 02:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
things are you know we're we've got the
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
changes in the process I just it's
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that it took so long that's
 
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
all I'd say thanks understood and that's
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
a fair point
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
director tomorrow
 
02:13:45.239 --> 02:13:46.010 align:start position:0%
director tomorrow
um

02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
staff shares representative Lynn's
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
concern about a time delay between
 
02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
change and a form that substantively
 
02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
affects an existing rule that would not
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
occur where a form is being Incorporated
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
by reference and then the form needed to
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
change because it is being Incorporated
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
by reference where it would occur is if
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the form uh is in addition to the text
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the rule and a change in the form
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
required would require a complimentary
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
change to the text of the rule we've
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
discussed that we're not sure yet how
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
it's best to be well it would need to be
 
02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
addressed in legislation but whether a
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
time period needs to be set for an
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
agency to go ahead and adopt a rule
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
to com to comport with the
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
form or what's the best mechanism yet
 
02:14:45.649 --> 02:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
well I wish you luck you've got a lot of
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
forms that people carry around and
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
controlling the additions is not a not a
 
02:14:56.689 --> 02:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.609 --> 02:14:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:01.729 --> 02:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
nothing this was it we already approved
 
02:15:04.490 --> 02:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
the rule this is we had a question and
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
they answered it
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
all right so the the
 
02:15:09.659 --> 02:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
all right so the the
um

02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
once I'm consent or the last two the
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
last two things off consent
 
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.189 align:start position:0%
last two things off consent
um

02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:20.089 --> 02:15:20.099 align:start position:0%
and the first one is 2023
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
23 about
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
um esol teachers yes and we had a
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
question that they were going to get
 
02:15:32.810 --> 02:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:15:35.930 --> 02:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
good morning um for the record Julie
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
Shea administrative rules coordinator
 
02:15:42.129 --> 02:15:42.139 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Education
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
I did reach out to the director and
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
um the answer that I was given is that
 
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
the federal definition and law will
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
always override the state rule that
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
being said
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't think a definition within
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
teacher certification would affect any
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
sort of funding for English language
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
Learners was there something in
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
particular about the definition that was
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
concerning thank you very much Mike the
 
02:16:11.689 --> 02:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
right now in our statutes on the
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
education funding it does not define
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
English language learner which is why my
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
concern was with people looking other
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
places for a definition the English
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
language learner as it's intended in the
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
school funding is for those who need to
 
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
have that increased level of proficiency
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
in order to bring up their level of
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
Competency the definition in this rule
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
which was an addition because the prior
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
rule had had no death and I did one want
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify that I did misspeak and I
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
looked at the older Rule and I saw that
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
that particular definition was new so I
 
02:16:43.250 --> 02:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
apologize for that no thank you I
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate this it's complex but in
 
02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
English English learner could be
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who is absolutely fluent in
 
02:16:52.009 --> 02:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
English far better than all their peers
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
but who also fluently speaks Mandarin at
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
home and So within that definition it
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a need for additional
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding it simply reflects
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
you know those unique unique benefits or
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
challenges that a student may have in
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
their needs I just wanted to make sure
 
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
that we had on record that this was not
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
in any ways intended to change the
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
education for funding formulation and
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
that um it does not sort of dilute those
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
resources no and looking at title III
 
02:17:20.929 --> 02:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
where that funding would be English
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
learner is not defined and there doesn't
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
seem to be any sort of
 
02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.129 align:start position:0%
seem to be any sort of
um

02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
further clarification or saying that
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
a definition would change the funding
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
for that I don't know I'm I'm not an
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
attorney so I don't know how to speak
 
02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:41.099 align:start position:0%
clearly on that but
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
do I understand you correctly to say
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
that an important element of our
 
02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:46.190 align:start position:0%
that an important element of our
educational

02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
educational
 
02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:49.700 align:start position:0%
funding formula is totally undefined
 
02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:51.469 align:start position:0%
funding formula is totally undefined
no

02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:17:53.889 --> 02:17:53.899 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
you just said there's no definition of
 
02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
English language learning no no there is
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
in the rule what I'm saying is that
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
death there is no definition of it that
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
I could that I could see
 
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
um but I was browsing while I was
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
looking so what I would like to say is
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:18:14.099 --> 02:18:14.690 align:start position:0%
that the
um

02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
the deadline for this is August 18th the
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
meeting is August 17th so if
 
02:18:23.209 --> 02:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
people are not comfortable with the
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
definition in the rule then I can bring
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah so again I think you're
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
right I think it's that the ell is
 
02:18:36.770 --> 02:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
defined under under title three yeah and
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
and that's where the qualifications and
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
that's where we use as a guideline for
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
our funding formula and this is relative
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
to teacher certification so again I
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to cross over in
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form as to how it
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
relates to education funding so I think
 
02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
would be okay moving forward with this
 
02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
with any problem having someone who just
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
went through the education funding
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
formula the fine-tooth comb I think
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're fine
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent the fellows all right thank
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
you um since I worked at the Department
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
of Education for 32 years and I wasn't
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
involved with the English language
 
02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
learners but I was involved with the
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid and also I had
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
did some you know tangential work with
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
different Federal funding programs the
 
02:19:22.009 --> 02:19:22.019 align:start position:0%
the there's a federal funding program
 
02:19:25.969 --> 02:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
for English language Learners and um
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot last I knew it's not a
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
lot of money it might be a couple
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year and they defined
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago they when I was
 
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
there they would Define English language
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
Learners with I think it was four
 
02:19:43.969 --> 02:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
different levels and one of the levels
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
is that they are proficient now but they
 
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
still get some Services because they may
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
not particularly things like the student
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
high school student who is proficient
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
but still may need some help with
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
technical language like if they were
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
applying to college and they get some
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
occasional help with that so it would be
 
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
a good question to ask the Department of
 
02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
Education is when you're funding
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid what what categories of
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
English language Learners are you using
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
I mean it may be all of them it may be
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
the first two or three levels that would
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
be a good question I don't think it has
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
any impact on what the the licensing
 
02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.849 align:start position:0%
any impact on what the the licensing
okay

02:20:31.849 --> 02:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you with
 
02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
all this clarification I'm very happy to
 
02:20:37.969 --> 02:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
know that we're not throwing a larger
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
net over this I'm not sure if there's
 
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
more discussion but if there isn't I I'd
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
be willing to move to that we approve
 
02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:44.929 align:start position:0%
be willing to move to that we approve
second

02:20:44.929 --> 02:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:20:44.939 --> 02:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
second
okay

02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion to approve and say
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
a second is there any further discussion
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
and everyone taking some consent was
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
HHS evaluation and treatment of income
 
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
yes it was 20 23 100.

yes it was 20 23 100.

02:21:20.809 --> 02:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what the what the issue
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
was representative lamb uh thank you um
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
on page eight of the packet page three
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the final proposal there was the note
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
um to the agency about those who can
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
prescribe Medical Services supplies or
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
equipment this is something we dealt
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
with in our committee a lot about all
 
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
the different all the different
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
abilities to prescribe
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it might be helpful
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
to amend this language to say Medical
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
Services supplies or equipment that are
 
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
not covered by Medicaid or which are
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a licensed Healthcare
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
practitioner in accordance with state
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
law something like that so that we
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
include aprns we include podiatrists we
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
include everybody who has licensing
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
Authority because we have people who are
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
not included under the definition of
 
02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:06.610 align:start position:0%
not included under the definition of
position

02:22:06.610 --> 02:22:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
valenzola I don't even know where you
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
are because I don't have a page eight
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I think that that was fixed in
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
it was yeah additional approval is not
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
posted but I do remember I made that
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
comment and I thought when I reviewed
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval that it had
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
been rectified if we don't have the
 
02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
conditional approval I'm trying to find
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
we approve it uh
 
02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
well it should be representatively on
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
what um could you give me like the point
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
zero whatever uh yes one moment it is
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
page three of the final proposal I just
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
know that when we're scanning through it
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
gets to be a little harder it is
 
02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:49.809 align:start position:0%
gets to be a little harder it is
um

02:22:49.809 --> 02:22:49.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's right above there we adopt with
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment four yes I four six fifty four
 
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:57.349 align:start position:0%
Amendment four yes I four six fifty four
zero

02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:22:59.530 --> 02:22:59.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm sorry
 
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.330 --> 02:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:23:12.770 --> 02:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
um again I'm sorry I didn't introduce
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
myself Nicole valenzola rules
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
coordinator Department of Health and
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
Human Services does the version you have
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leon say medical
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
professional at the end instead of
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
physician it does not where that was
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
admitted okay
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
we do have the conditional approval as
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
part of the packet and now the packet I
 
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
have does have that
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
you just scroll past the the final
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
proposal and there's a conditional
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
approach I see that now I'm sorry that
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
was really confusing to have the
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
conditional approval in with the final
 
02:23:48.410 --> 02:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
proposal maybe it's my newness but I
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
apologize and retract any concern okay
 
02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
in that case you wish to move to approve
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
yes so moved back again
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by the committee
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%

02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh is there any need for the
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
continued meeting
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%

02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
