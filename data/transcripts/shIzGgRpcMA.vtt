and important deliberative body in the
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature that being the
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
um wh while HB 290 is a tax bill I view
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
this first as a public health Bill uh
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
nicotine use and addictions robs our
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
citizens of actual years and quality
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
years of life uh the side effects of
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
nicotine consumption cost our society
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
funds to treat diseases that would not
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
present and taxpayers insurers expense
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh for these things smoking and vaping
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
are legal activities that nonetheless
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
the public has an interest in
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging the free choice to use less
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh secondhand smoke itself also has
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
devastating Health consequences even to
 
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.710 align:start position:0%
devastating Health consequences even to
non-users

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
reducing the free practice of nicotine
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
use comes in three buckets which I
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
plagiarize uh from Nancy vaugh of the
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association from past
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
testimony before this committee those
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
are regulation Taxation and
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
cessation uh this bill uh just deals
 
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.909 align:start position:0%
cessation uh this bill uh just deals
with

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
taxation HB 290 deals with three
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
separate subjects cigarettes vaping e
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and then finally other
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
categories of nicotine and tobacco use
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about cigarettes first New
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cigarette taxes are the lowest
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
in the New England region uh this bill
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
proposes to raise the cigarette tax by a
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
dollar a pack from $1.78 to
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
278 unlike most taxes the cigarette
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
taxes do not auto adjust with inflation
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
as do most taxes that Granite Staters
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
pay for example like the meals and rooms
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
tax uh for example uh 15 years ago you
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
might you might have bought a tuna fish
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
sandwich at a restaurant for $4 uh you
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
would have paid uh 9% of that $4 in tax
 
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.150 align:start position:0%
would have paid uh 9% of that $4 in tax
or

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
36 today the price might be $8 and then
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
the tax would have gone up from 36 Cents
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
to now it would be 66 cents for a tuna
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
fish sandwich without the legislature
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
doing anything because it's a percent
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
tax uh the taxes that we pay on
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
cigarettes have fixed at a $1.78 they
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
haven't changed uh in any way since uh
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
2013 uh they were actually this the
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax was actually reduced
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
during the Great
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
Recession uh in 2011 by 10 cents a pack
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh but returned uh to the
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
$178 uh level that had been in place uh
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
for 6 years before that automatically
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
because the promised extra Revenue that
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
would come from having a low lower tax
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
rate never
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
materialized and uh part of the bill was
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
just saying if we didn't get more
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from cigarette taxes then the
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
rate would go back to a
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
$1.78 so since then uh since 2013
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
they've been at
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
a178 it should be noted that New
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's cigarette tax rate will
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
still be lower even with the added
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
dollar than all New England State's uh
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
present tax rate with the exception of
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
Maine uh Maine's current tax rate is $2
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
a pack uh but the main Governor um is is
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
has proposed and I I uh Pro I'll provide
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
a su summary of a press release on that
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
is proposing to increase their cigarette
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
tax by a dollar per pack bringing it up
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
to $3 per pack uh main cigarette uh
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
purchases are also subject to a 5% sales
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
tax so uh and uh the other states that
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
surround us are far higher so uh uh for
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
example if you're if you're over in hand
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
over uh even even uh the the tax rate
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
across border over in Vermont would be
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
over a dollar higher some states are
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
above $5 a
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
pack uh as a public health matter and
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
given the long Hiatus since the last
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax change uh HB 290 proposes
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
this change at this time so second let's
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
talk about vaping prior to
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
2019 vaping was legal and unregulated
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
and untaxed for that matter so as I said
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
there's regulation Taxation and cation
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
as three ways to handle that back in
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
2019 uh we were in a Child Health crisis
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
caused by the proliferation of this new
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
form of of nicotine use kids were being
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
addicted at an alarming rate and 5 years
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
later we now know know that a generation
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
of kids have become addicted to nicotine
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
with permanent negative effects uh with
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
a sense of urgency the house passed uh
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
what was Bill that started in the Senate
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh the tax rates were considered by this
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
great committee but were put in place
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
with the explicit understanding they
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
were a
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
placeholder and uh the same the the same
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
rates were assigned that was in the SE
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill that first regulated
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
vaping the rates itself were not heavily
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
vetted by this committee uh in fact I
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
believe they were proposed by industry
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
itself uh there was some concern in the
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee to not adopt the bill because
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
once the rates were established they
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
would not be able to be increased easily
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
as there's always a substantial group uh
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
of concerned uh legislators that vote
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
against anything that sounds like a tax
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
increase even if the original tax rate
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
for example 8% less than attack some of
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
a tuna fish sandwich was meant to be a
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
placeholder as an individual cherishes
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
the role of businesses and shaping a
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
quality life I I am heart sick at the
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
business practices of a leading closed
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
Vape vaping system the business
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
practices of this one manufacturer a a
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
leader in the space were reprehensible
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh I have a link to an episode of the TV
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
show called American Greed that uh
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
discusses um uh the practice is about a
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
7-minute overview um that I would
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to watch if you want to
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll provide it to Karen uh to
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
forward to the
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
committee but I would also like to say
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
that even though this manufacturer's uh
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
Behavior was against the public interest
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
I believe there are many manufacturers
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
of oping vaping systems that are very
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
responsible and work with their
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
customers to reduce nicotine consumption
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
over time and use their platform to do
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
so so it's not not a um uh a single type
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
of industry but uh others have discussed
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
it the ways and means briefing part of
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
the movement from cigarettes to vaping
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
is also due to a lower tax burden on
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
vaping uh for consumers than for
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
cigarettes another reason to reopen and
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
reconsider the appropriate uh tax rate
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh and perhaps replace the the uh
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
placeholder rates that were put in place
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
with the original legislation in 1990
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
and 20
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
so the proposal is to move all of the
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
levels for Vaping um uh New Hampshire is
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
unusual in that we have uh two different
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
um uh vaping tax rates almost every
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
state bases it on one formula or another
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and a few States still do not tax
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
vaping products at
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
all so um and finally the leg this
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
legislation calls for a legislative
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee to review all tobacco and
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
nicotine regulation and tax rates I
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a it makes great sense for
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
this great committee to look at all
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
these other tobacco rates and for for
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
example even premium cigars which are
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
untaxed at this point and should do so
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
as a matter of of practice every every
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
bium overall this legislation would
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
raise a significant amount of money for
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state I think the timing for this
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
might be more acceptable uh uh at this
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
point uh that's because we just
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
eliminated the IND tax and uh uh for
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
this bium without any offsetting uh
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue increases or expense reductions
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and this is one way to maybe fill in
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of the Gap uh that am amount is
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
extremely large this this won't fill
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
that by itself but it would help um
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
nicotine taxes are definitely less
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
harmful than other forms of taxes that
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
we have in terms of the economy so I
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
would consider a nice effort uh to move
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
towards the balanced budget uh despite
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
the unfund funded tax cuts the last
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
legislature left us with and I think
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
this committee is the only place in New
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has the skills and
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
experience and expertise to figure it
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
out so I'm pleased to offer this uh to
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
you um with the hope that uh uh that can
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
make a better state for us so with that
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take any questions that you
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
may have thank you for your testimony
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative Ro
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative taken this question I
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
really have two questions uh do you have
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
an idea of how the 278 you propose
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
compares to the current in real dollars
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
when um the doar 78 was first
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
established oh or enacted so uh yeah so
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
if you 278 would be pretty almost
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as a178
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
was in real dollars when it was first
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
put in in 2008 put another way the rate
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
of inflation since 2008 is about
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
56% and 278 is about 50 cents or 56%
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
higher than
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
a178 so
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
basically uh in real dollars the tax
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
rate for cigarettes would be unchanged
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
so if it was handled the same way that
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
say some of our percentage taxes are
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
handled they probably would adjust it to
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
to about that rate a followup Mr
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
chairman on that position you're taking
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you consider raising the cigarette
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
tax over several year did you did you
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
consider raising that over several years
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
rather than by a dollar just here all at
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
once oh that's a really good question um
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
the uh so you know one thing one thing
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
that this committee could recommend or
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
the bill could recommend is raising the
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
tax say 20 cents a year by or uh over 5
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
years uh but um in terms of having a
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
public health impact it's much better
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
actually leave it flat for a number of
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
years and then raise it by a lot and
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
because people notice the price
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
difference and allows them to
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
consider use that as an excuse to
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
consider a cation program or quitting
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
smoking if you just raise it a little
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
bit every year the system will kind of
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
filter it in and they really won't even
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
notice the change in the tobacco prices
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
that much so you know the analogy to me
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
is like the frog and the boiling water
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know you turn it up slowly they
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't notice it's getting hotter and
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
hotter but if you know if they jump into
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
the 150 degree water they say you know I
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
got to get the heck out of this thing so
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
I got to stop smoking so you know as a
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
matter of public health policy If part
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
of the goal is to um encourage people to
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
think about whether they want to smoke
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps um you know stop using
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
nicotine then um you know a periodic
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase in rates and then
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
keeping it level for several years will
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
do better to do that Mr chair my second
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
question concerns vaping tax uh how do
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
you how do New Hampshire tax rates
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
compare to the other states
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
concerning vaping tax yeah so even with
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
the proposed rate that's in here um uh
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
again we would still be equal to or less
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
than all the states in New England
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
except for for Maine we're now way way
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
below all the other states at the
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
current rate and as I said you know the
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
the portion of it that's 8% you know we
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
have this bifurcated tax system that's
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
in um uh as described in um chapter 78
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh 2
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh so you know just reading from
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
um the rate is 30 30 cents per
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
milliliter of volume of liquid of uh or
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
other substance in the cartridge
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
container um uh and uh for one and then
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh for for containers of liquid or of
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
other substances containing nicotine
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
that are intended to be opened uh so an
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
open container system it's 8% of the
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
wholesale price so um and you know more
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
typically you know the the the rate
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
proposed here which was uh um given
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
given as a suggestion to me by the
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association is equivalent
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
to the 65% of wholesale price that we
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
use for other systems so so thank you
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
for that as far as vaping taxes by state
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'll also provide a link uh that comes
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
from the tax Foundation that lists The
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
Vaping taxes in 2024 for all states and
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
I'll provide that to Karen okay
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative Omen yeah thank you I had
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
a question on the primary purpose of the
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill you know where the revenue
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee here Ways and Means so is the
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of the bill to raise
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
revenue with the reduced smoking is an
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
incidental Factor the primary purpose of
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
the bill to cut back on the nicotine
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco stock
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
with uh Revenue raising being a
 
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.789 align:start position:0%
with uh Revenue raising being a
secondary

00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
issue well I I personally think one of
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
the great things about this committee is
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
that they can think about both and um
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I I watch the uh
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
presentations to Ways and Means and and
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh even some of the speakers that I
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily agree with you know
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
talked about that some taxes do more
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
harm than others uh in fact uh propos
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
suggested that um uh that um property
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
taxes do less harm than than income
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
taxes and so I think this committee is a
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
logical place uh to consider that uh in
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I can I I consider it
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
both I think you know this is a uh a
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill that increases uh Revenue um mainly
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to be be
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
successful in in
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
um uh uh having so many people quit
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
using nicotine that that the the overall
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
rate of consumption will drop enough for
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
it to go down but if people chose not to
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
use nicotine and the revenue uh didn't
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
materialize I'd consider it a successful
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
Bill and um uh so if it uh so I I I
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
really think think it it tries to do
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
both but I see it as a public health
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill first uh and first and foremost but
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question so
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us why one tax or I
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if you if you're aware why
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
one tax is eight% the other tax was 30%
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
do you know what the reasoning behind
 
00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
do you know what the reasoning behind
that

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
that
was

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
um well there there's a matter of I you
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
know you
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
one of the issues and I I said we didn't
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't um spend a we we acted a
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
pretty short order on this but the clo
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
systems they sell a piece of Hardware
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
that that's got a fixed amount of uh
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
nicotine and and um uh material in it uh
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
the open systems are meant to be reused
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
they might have nicotine with different
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
different levels of nicotine especially
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
for those who are trying to wean people
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
off nicotine they may have a higher
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
level at first and then with their
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh fillings might have less
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
and um uh so you know it's issues about
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
taxing the hardware versus uh the
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
nicotine itself and um uh and uh I think
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of uh persuasive cases
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
being made you know for those who were
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
pursuing a quasi medical use of it even
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
though didn't have a medical label um
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
that the systems might be different so I
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
I was just concerned that because one
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
was 8% one was 30% you're raising them
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
both to 30 cents yeah what did I say 30
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
cents per millit 30 cents and one was
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
eight 8% they're very very different
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
structures and we're one of we're pretty
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
much the only state that has that kind
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
of a bifurcation of these two different
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
types of systems except from I think
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
Arkansas thank you yes represent thank
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh what what do
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh what is your vision for what the
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
committee that you're proposing will do
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
bill won't do if we if we uh accept it
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
and pass
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
it because you if I may you you you've
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work here follow on
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
research on this so what what's left for
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
the committee to do
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah um well you know I think
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
the the cigarettes the cigarette tax is
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
a little clearer that's been been in
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
place a lot longer uh I I heard some
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
testimony at uh or speech last week uh
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh from one of the Senators talking
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
about how some of the vaping systems are
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh avoiding taxation at all so there may
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
be some regulation issues that over
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
overlay um but you know I I I I think
 
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.310 align:start position:0%
overlay um but you know I I I I think
the

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.149 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
um the the interweaving of you know what
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
what's you know New Hampshire being a
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
being a place uh where free access to
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
things like this at a reasonable tax
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
rate should be considered I do think
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's considerable up upward room with
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
still having um still maintaining our
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
lowest in the region or uh uh tax rates
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I would I would expect uh that the
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
committee would want to verify that and
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
and and talk about really what what what
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
the reasonable
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
um uh tax level should be for these
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
things thank you represent ORS thank you
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks rep for taking my
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
question so I'm glad rep M asked the
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
question about whether it's to raise
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
revenue or kill tobacco or whatever but
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're trying to raise
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.909 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're trying to raise
revenue

00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way this looks to me so a
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
couple comments before I ask my question
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
one would be we've already heard about
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
the premium cigars in the state of New
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't want to drive that
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
industry out you know if we were to tax
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
that we would we saw what happened in
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but my other thought was
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
like menthol cigarettes as the states
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
around us have killed off menthol
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
cigarettes I mean it's added to our
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
industry and I would hate to see our
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
state lose all that revenue from the
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
other states so I think maybe one thing
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
you might consider if you want to raise
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
revenue with this bill and I talked to
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
one of the other reps uh yesterday about
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
this was maybe you would just raise at
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
22 cents so we don't exceed I think it's
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
Maine is at $2 a
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
pack so I I believe it's Maine in any
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
event we don't want to exceed what our
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
neighbors are doing we want to keep that
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
Advantage because we have people coming
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
in from state so would you agree with
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that we want to we don't want to
 
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
lose that revenue or well uh first first
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
of all I you know I will provide this uh
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
that Maine is proposing to increase to
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
$3 a pack uh so I certainly think that's
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
fair um consideration is what is the
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
competitive impact and um you know I I
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
would guess uh um um my my good friend
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
from uh from Greenland there he's
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
probably the closest to Maine so maybe
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
some of the of of the members of this
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
committee most of you are over on the
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont border uh but uh but spread
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
around um but um uh so some of the
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
businesses might there might be
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
concerned uh but Maine also does pay
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
sales tax on top of it so they really
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
pay 225 in state tax not
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
$2 uh but then that'll go up to 330 uh
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
if if the proposal goes in in a dollar
 
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.870 align:start position:0%
if if the proposal goes in in a dollar
here

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh would um uh would still have us have
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest rate in the region I I think
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
that's an entirely reasonable line of
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry to consider um uh you know being
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
the lowest in the region and what that
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
may do for businesses versus the public
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
health impact um but I think I think um
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
I I also think if main knows that uh
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're considering the similar uh tax
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
increase that would encourage them to do
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing as well so thank
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
you representative D thank you Mr
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I thank my friend from Lincoln
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and it kind of
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
couples with what representative ORS
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
just said I don't happen to be on the
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
Vermont nor main border I'm on the
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts border we reap a lot of
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
revenue from cigarette and vape taxes I
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
see it daily M commuters come in
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
by the product in New Hampshire because
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
we tax it right we do it right they go
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
home they leave the revenue with us I'm
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
just wondering because I know you do
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
your due
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
diligence what may be the impact
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
negatively if we raise the tax on this
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
we're counting on this Revenue right now
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
and everyone agrees we have to find uh
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
places to uh both increase revenue and
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
tighten our belts I'm afraid of exposure
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
in the revenue we're already counting on
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm a a former smoker myself so I I
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
get the health aspect of it too but um
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
we do things right in New Hampshire they
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
you know we're making those sales for a
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
specific reason New Hampshire Advantage
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
is real
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
and tary a secondary question is I'm
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
more specific to the tobacco tax you
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
said a a acceptable rate
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
how did you come up with the
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
$1 per and I thank you for taking my
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
question well it's always nice to get a
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
question from a from a reformed smoker
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
from Salem because
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh the um uh the the the dollar actually
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
was was meant to be um sufficiently
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
enough so that smokers would notice the
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
difference and um I I think there's
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
there's a tradeoff between um you know I
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
had um a good question from my friend
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
about raising taxes slowly versus
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
raising them all at once um the you know
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
there you know clearly will be tobacco
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
products offered in New Hampshire that
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
are not offered in Massachusetts due to
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
regulation basically the Menthol
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
products their tax rates even with the
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
full dollar will still be significantly
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
less than they are in
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so um you know those those
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
on their way uh to go skiing in Lincoln
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
certainly would would find it valuable
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
um to stock up while they're here even
 
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
um to stock up while they're here even
at

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
278 um uh but the um uh the full dollar
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
and doing it all at once was was you
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
know really meant for for those in state
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
who smoke and just to have them consider
 
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
who smoke and just to have them consider
it

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman thank you I I
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
have a differing perspective and I've
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard the the health issue brought up
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
and just again the health issue my
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
is I want everybody to have the freedom
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
if if you want to chain smoke cigarettes
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
that's your business the business of
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
this committee is uh revenue and
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
Taxation I think we need to stick with
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
that and and uh that that's where the
 
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:53.559 align:start position:0%
hard cell has to be for me I smoked for
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
over 40 years it was my decision to do
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
what I did I don't want this to to be
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
used as a vehicle to get people to quit
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
smoking it may end up being a vehicle to
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
help people quit smoking but that's not
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
and this is not this is not a cation
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
program this is um uh and um it 100%
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
relies on free choice of granite sters
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
to choose whether to smoke or not
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
whether to vape or not so um but there
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
is a public cost um Health cost and and
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
that to treat people and this raises
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
more money that way uh to do that and I
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
think I think in a way that's more in
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
the state interest than for example
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
taxing um business income or something
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
else so um but thank you very much for
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
your questions and
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
Aly oh
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
still I only look that way
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth thank you for
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I missed it at the
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:14.829 align:start position:0%
 
know

00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
350 so we still would be well below
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we still would have the
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
menthal and I might have missed it but
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
actually your bill doesn't mention
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of smokers I don't
 
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.470 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of smokers I don't
think

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
so really it is purely a revenue bill
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
that was just kind of your aside um
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
because that's really the part we have
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
to decide about is the revenue
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
part and also um would you think that
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
all of these are gradually be going up
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
anyway for all of New England over time
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
again so it does keep up with uh you
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
know so you don't freeze them for 10
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
years like they did before yeah my
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is Massachusetts is
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
considering raising them right now and
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
anyway so I mean I think it will go like
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
this as far as the different states um
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
but um I'm comfortable with the 278 it
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
is 278 is what the build is thank
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
you you have a question representative
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm intrigued by what you were saying
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
about working on the the uh Vape costs
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
and this committee spent a lot of
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
time uh
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly figuring and led by a brami
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
figuring out uh what we thought was a
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
fair price for the open we we did that
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
open canister versus the
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
closed basically
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
because the liquid in the open canister
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
is the only thing that people keep
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
buying if they've
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
got if they've got a device already that
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
will take it
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
um and we send it over to the Senate and
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate I think cut it by about four
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
or maybe
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
more and we're stuck with that
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
rate right now and
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
so it the other thing that we had
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
considered a little bit was um
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
the the interests of the very small uh
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
traders in in the open canisters who
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
were more of a craft group than than a
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
retailer and um trying to protect them
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
to some at some extent but now uh what
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
we're hearing is that it's all
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
um most of what is bought is brought in
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
illegally from
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
China without any control over what's in
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
it without any uh on tax being imposed
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
on it and um there is a bill in the
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
Senate that I'm on that is working
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
towards a solution to to handling the
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
tax issue at anyway but
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
um I find it sort of difficult talking
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
about both of them at the same time the
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
the cigarette and
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
the and the
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
vaping but you have a question for him
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so I'm what it sounded like you
 
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.510 align:start position:0%
and so I'm what it sounded like you
had

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh you had information from the senate
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
about why they decided to cut
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
did you well the Ju Just What I heard is
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's what the industry the industry
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
suggested is what I had heard it
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
happened at the time and it came back we
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
had to either leave leave uh vaping
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
unregulated or accept the rates as
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
placeholders and and uh that's how we
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
got where we
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
are so would that then have been the
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
small industry that we were also trying
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
to protect because they were trying to
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
cut people down at least that's it what
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
they were saying well I know or what my
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
sympathies were more for those people
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I'm not sure where the
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
Senate was based on what I've heard the
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
jewels right the
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
jewels thanks thank you question I have
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%

who want to speak so does anyone have
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
final question for representative
 
00:38:56.319 --> 00:38:58.510 align:start position:0%
final question for representative

increase the health for all citizens um
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
I do have testimony which I suppose I
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
should have passed around before because
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make reference to something
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
in here that you might want to be able
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the American Heart Association is in
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
support of um House Bill 290 um we very
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
much appreciate um representative
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
Stringham for bringing this bill forward
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
and starting the discussion um which has
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
not been had here in in New Hampshire
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
for quite some time about raising um
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco taxes um and uh so we very much
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
in support of a minimum of $1 um per
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
pack for uh tax on cigarettes if um any
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
anyone wanted to go higher than that we
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
would also support that um and also that
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
we do feel we need to bring the rate for
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
the ecigarette um tax um up um so that
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
it is in parody with the tobacco um that
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the cigarette um tax rate um and we
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
are using um um in our in our discussion
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
that we've had so far using the rate for
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products refer to it as
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
OTP um which are non-combustible
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
products that um are popular amongst
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
youth um and and adult smokers as well
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
um that they might be doing in addition
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
to their um their um their smoking um
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
heart disease and so um are the some of
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
the leading causes of um death and
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
disability and health care costs in in
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
the whole country as as well as in New
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and tobacco is the leading
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
preventable cause of um heart disease
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular diseases um so that is
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
why we're here today um we are here
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
because there is a health benefit to
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
raising tobacco taxes high enough so
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the price is felt um by the
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
consumer um for um really for those
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
folks who um are considering um stopping
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
their tobacco use um a price increas
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um could help um support their efforts
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
in doing
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
that um there's a three-fold benefit
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
though to raising tobacco taxes besides
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
reducing and preventing tobacco related
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
um diseases and um and uh the the use of
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
tobacco it also creates a stable source
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
of revenue for states um you will see
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
attached um to my testimony um a listing
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
of all the states who have raised their
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
tobacco cigarette taxes um by um at
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
least $1 per pack and you will see that
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the the the um the
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
number of packs sold will go down in
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
states that increase their tobacco tax
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
by a meaningful um level um that they
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
always see a revenue increase um and
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll hear from from others um
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that will follow me um regarding um what
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
um what the impact for New Hampshire
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
could be on revenues and you are a
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
revenue committee so I understand that
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
that is really what you will all be
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
looking at um but I appreciate all of
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
your concern for the public health
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
impact as well um so again um whenever a
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
state increases their tobacco cigarette
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
tax um by a meaningful amount they will
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
see an increase in tax revenues most
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
adult smokers getting back to the the
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
health aspect most adult smokers begin
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
before the age of 18 and so um young
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
people and lowincome folks are very
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
price sensitive so again that is is why
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
we we look at a tobacco tax rate for the
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefits we are looking at the $1 per
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
pack in New Hampshire in particular
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
because what we do see again evidence
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
shows that every 10% increase in the
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
price of a pack of cigarettes results in
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
a decrease in people stopping um using
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh cigarettes so for adults it's a
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
little bit less a little bit higher for
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
young people and the um the price
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
average price of a pack of cigarettes um
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
is is close to uh to $10 with all the
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
taxes included on it um so that does
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
correspond to a 10% increase in price if
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
I know um representative um Stringham
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
was asked this this question and he he
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
did um answer it and we we support the
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
answer that he gave which is if you were
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
to do lower increases over a a longer
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
period of time um we will not see that
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
um that public health benefit um there
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
are many ways that the tobacco price at
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
the registers could drop um and uh and
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
they consumer would not see any any
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
difference in their price of um of
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um and again as I said the um
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
the tax rate on ecigarettes which are
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
very popular with youth um the the
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking rate amongst young
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire is now under 4%
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
which is fabulous news but they are
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
using um ecigarettes at at an increasing
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
rate um and other tobacco products that
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
are constantly coming on the market so
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
we always need to be mindful of that
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a lot of of time or um
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
or energy um nationally to um look at
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
the decrease um in use with a a tax on
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes so this is something that I
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
would urge a study committee on this if
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed um to to look at
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
as well um and um the health care costs
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
so someone had referred to um tobacco
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
use as being something that only impacts
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
the tobacco user um we're talking
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
health care costs in New Hampshire um
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
and and a a large almost 20% of that is
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
covered or or carried by the Medicaid um
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh program um and so the increase um in
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxes that spreads out to all taxpayers
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
is about $800 a year that people pay in
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
increase taxes for the cost of tobacco
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
related illness so it is something that
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
impacts everyone all
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and I do have information
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
about that in my in my test
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um and again
 
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
testimony um and again
so

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
um it Bears repeating so I'm sorry to be
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
repeating myself but um tobacco use
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
rates are decreasing
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
naturally whether it's policy in New
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policy in our neighboring
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
states we are seeing um uh usage rates
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
drop if we do not in New Hampshire raise
 
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.109 align:start position:0%
drop if we do not in New Hampshire raise
the

00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
price raise the cigarette tax we will
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
continue to see a decrease in revenues
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that that this does pass
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
and that we do see this increase in
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
revenues from the tax increase to help
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
offset some other gaps that might be
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
seen in New Hampshire's revenues
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
currently so that's one thing that I
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
would would suggest is something that
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
you can look at with this bill is to you
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
know look at it consider it and see what
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
um what the other gaps are and revenues
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
that this might be able to help fill and
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
again um it is proven um amongst these
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
other states that you see in my other
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
attachment to increase revenues um no
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
matter what the um what what goes on
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
with the sale the number of of packs
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
sold in the
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
state um and so I thank you I hope that
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
you'll consider my testimony um and if
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
you have questions I will attempt to
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
question you just uh testified that
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
whenever there's an increase in the tax
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
there's an increase in Revenue yes and
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time there's a decrease in
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
people purchasing it even though there's
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
increase in Revenue so how does there a
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
correlation between health benefit tax
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
increase because the the decrease in the
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
sales of tobacco products is typically
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
because people are not using as much
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco as they were before so again
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
what we actually do want to see decrease
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the number of packs of cigarettes
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
sold but you as a state as a Ways and
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
Means Committee will see the revenue
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
from that tax increase higher and will
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
more than cover the um the loss of sales
 
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.230 align:start position:0%
more than cover the um the loss of sales
in

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
pxs I'm
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
sorry yes represent
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and and I
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
apologize I was testifying before
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
another committee so apologize for
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
coming in late but um
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
I have two questions if I may um first
 
00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
I have two questions if I may um first
to

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
clarify did I understand you correctly
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
to say that it the the impact of the
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
health uh the detrimental health effects
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
of tobacco smoking use of tobacco
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
products generally is creating an $800
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
additional cost per New Hampshire
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
resident because of the impact on
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I I believe this might actually
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
be more naal numbers but yes and and we
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
are seeing the same Trend in in all
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
states in terms of tobac related illness
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid do you if if I may follow
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
up Mr ch um do you have or or might you
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
be able to obtain uh information
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%

is New
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we have quite a few
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
customers I just wanted to come to let
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
within our customer base most of our
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
customers are on the uh the border of
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont um some of our
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
best customers and uh I've heard
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
countless times from them calling us and
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
say hey I have a special order I got
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
someone coming from Massachusetts I got
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
someone coming from a different state to
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
to they need a special order can you
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
bring it to us and it brings these
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
people up from these other states for
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
this Revenue I feel if we we do raise
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
this we're going to lose out on this
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we're we're we're getting
 
00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
we're getting New York we're getting
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island we're getting Vermont we're
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
getting Massachusetts customers coming
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
up and spending their money and we're
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
collecting this this tax revenue I feel
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
by by raising it before these other
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
states do we're risking that of losing
 
00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
that customer you know
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's something we see um that
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue has increased for us because of
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
these um customers that we've taken on
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
we we used to have just local customers
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
and then we went to the Vermont border
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
and we see that quite a few customers in
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
in on the Vermont border um have people
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
come over as well so it's it's not just
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts we do have it happen
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the state you know not
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
so much in Maine because they are fairly
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
close to us but if we do jump up you
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
know we may lose some customers in New
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might go over to main you know
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
on on that border so um that's just
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
where we're at can I answer any
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um do you do
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
anything with vaping products or okay
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so how
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
much of an increase do you think your
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
business can handle before you start to
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
see a negative
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
impact um in other words my concern is
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
going more than 22 cents a pack on the
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
tax if it does go up 22 cents puts us
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
right where Maine is now I agree so do
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
you think that would be a maximum do you
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
think there's a different maximum that
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
you would go to I I feel like that would
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
be a safe spot for us to feel that we
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lose those customers I feel
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're keeping those customers
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
they're not going up to main the ones
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
that are coming from other states I feel
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
like if we we do that a lot of these
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
customers for them to drive an extra you
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
know a a lot of our customers are in the
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the Salem the seabook area um that for
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
them to go another you know five miles
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
up the coast is really nothing for these
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
people that are coming from New York
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're coming from Rhode irland and you
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
know other parts of Massachusetts I
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
really don't think it would be that big
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
of a deal if we were you know 78 cents
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
that 80 cents you know you're talking $8
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
a carton a lot of these people come up
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
they buy five six cartons at a time so
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
they they they come up once a month
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
they're spending a great you know great
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
deal amount of money with these with
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
these customers these are you know
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
things we're hearing from these
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
customers and I feel like we would lose
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
that that that sale so followup followup
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah I had the same thought that you
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of let the other
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
states raise their taxes and then we can
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
raise ours behind them would you I I
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
take it you do agree with that
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely very good thank
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more questions thank
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%

Cancer Society cancer Action Network
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I have the
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
pleasure of covering in the state of
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
Vermont now too so te a little bit of
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on over
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
there my home is New Hampshire um and we
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
are in support of here appearing today
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 290 and thank
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for bringing it
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
forward so we can have this conversation
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I did not bring my
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
glasses so I'm kind of a bit of a
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
disadvantage but I'm going do my best um
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
there are um you've already heard about
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
the number of public health benefits
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
from from miss vau the Heart Association
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
the Cancer Society would um would only
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
Echo what she's saying so I'm not going
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
to repeat myself I know you have a lot
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
of other folks that want to speak today
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
but there are approximately
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
10,290 Grand estator that will be
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer in
 
00:56:52.029 --> 00:56:52.039 align:start position:0%
2025 and
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are approximately
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
2,980 people
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that will
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
lose their battle to
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
cancer the question was asked um ree by
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the previous speaker what um do we
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
know that the number the percentage of
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
of those deaths that may be attributable
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
to uh to tobacco use I can't speak to
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
heart disease um and all that goes along
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
with with what goes along with that but
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
I can tell you for cancer approximately
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
30.6 % of all deaths cancer deaths in
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are directly
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
attributable to tobacco use that would
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
correlate to approximately 9911
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
people out of the out of the estimate
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
that that will will lose their battle
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
this year with
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
cancer um but this is a revenue
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee so let's talk about the
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
economics of uh of this
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill the state of New Hampshire you've
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
already heard um incurs approximately
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
800 $47 million on Direct health care
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
cost directly related to tobacco use 847
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
million including
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
149.6 million in direct Medicaid cost to
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire these are New
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire numbers
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
847 and of that 140 almost 150 million
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid costs and additionally a
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
number that's even more sobering is the
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
state experiences approximately 1.5
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
billion that's with a B billion dollars
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
in loss productivity
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
due to smoking related um
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
illnesses that's a lot of
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
money but there is some good news if you
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
look at the other um the other handout
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
and before we get to the other handout
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
the question was asked by uh to a
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
previous couple previous speakers well
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
what if we just did it
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
incrementally we share the same concerns
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
at the Cancer Society that the Heart
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
Association does about the public health
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
impact but not just that if you did it
 
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:57.559 align:start position:0%
incrementally the tobacco industry is
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
very good at offsetting any kind of tax
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
increase or price increases with uh
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
practices they use uh with discounts and
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
payments to retailers and wholesalers
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
they've done this for for for years this
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
is not a new practice so anything less
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
than what's being proposed on House Bill
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
290 will be easily offset and
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
manipulated by these by these
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
companies so if you look at the second
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
handout we haven't talked about revenues
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
at all really this morning and what we
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
think this bill will bring in the uh
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note according to uh Dr or
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue rather was a little interesting
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
to me but we've been running Revenue
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
estimates for this committee I actually
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
do it in every state but for this
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee I've been working for the
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
Cancer Society for 14 years and I can
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
tell you every time we talk about
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax increases and it predates me
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
we run Revenue estimates for you
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aly and representative
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
major uh your predecessor Mr chairman
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
could probably tell you that we're we're
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
pretty good at estimating what we think
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
these taxes will bring in we were just
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
about spot on we were a little under uh
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the reduction and
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
how bad that was going to be for the New
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy we lost a lot of money
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
so we have a pretty good track record
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
and according to our our estimates State
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is looking at if you do
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
a dollar increase $4
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
49.7 million almost $50 million an
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue through this uh this
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
tax increase but there are also uh
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
offsets um projected health savings you
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
can see on here and again I'm sorry I
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
didn't bring my classes so uh the
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
substantial amounts of money that um
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
that are uh potential savings over the
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
course of a number of years to to the
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and directly to the
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
state and Medicaid savings so I would
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
say that this is a
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
um a a good thing for the State of New
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've talked about a little
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
bit about our neighbors uh to the south
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
east and west the Commonwealth of
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts charges $351
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax Vermont is
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
$38 Maine is $2 currently and we've
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
heard that Governor Mills has proposed a
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
dollar increase there but what you
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
haven't really heard a lot I mean
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham did mention
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
this but people were paying their state
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
sales taxes on top of this so um these
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
are uh the 35138 and $2 are not actually
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
the full fright of what people were
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
paying on top of the base price of their
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so uh New Hampshire
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
would still be lower of course we
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as low as Maine um and I can
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
tell you I spent uh how many years 12
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
years sitting in the House of
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives as a member and um I
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
represented a border of community I
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
represented first my hometown of
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford and then the city of
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
summersworth in Rollinsford we had a lot
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
of tobacco retailers corner stores and
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
all of that and um they're all still
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
there they haven't stopped every time
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's a tobacco tax increase you'll
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
have people parade in here and tell you
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
that the stores every store in the
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
state's going to close but you will see
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
that there have been increases in
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
retailers across the state um so I
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be put off by that there are
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
real Public Health increases and impacts
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
and there are real Revenue positive
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue impacts that can be made by
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation with that Mr
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%

purchases our experience has proven that
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
tax increases in New England of a dollar
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
or more a pack result in volume uh
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
decline of more than 21% of consumers
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
shift their purchasing behaviors to seek
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives including price and
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
convenience today New Hampshire
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
retailers and consumers alike enjoy the
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
price Advantage which has resulted in
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
significant volume growth in New
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stores resulting in larger tax
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
revenue uh this comes at the expense of
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
our neighbors like the south east and
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
west and north in short it's a zero sum
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
game which someone wins and someone
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
loses uh cigarettes and evap products
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
Drive foot traffic into stores where the
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
so I strongly hope you oppose the dollar
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
increase on cigarettes and keep New
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
whole thank you thank you any
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions no yes represent ORS thank you
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so my question is would you be
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of an
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
increase that re would would be after
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
the tax if there's a tax increase in the
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
other states and if we at 25 cents
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
below maybe a dollar or whatever their
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
increase so if their increas is about a
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
dollar that's what we're hearing if we
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
were only increase our 75 cents and did
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
it after like 30 days after theirs went
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
into effect do you think that would
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
negatively impact your
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
business I think any increase will
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
against foot traffic coming in to the
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
stores uh within any
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
increase it it it just slows traffic so
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
I think any increase at all will you
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
know slow down traffic in our stores and
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.510 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you for your testimony
thank

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
you okay I still have six uh people to
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%

so if what you're saying is something
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
that to a minimum thank you uh next I
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hager good morning folks uh thank you
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
for having me today my name is Max Hagar
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
Salem New Hampshire uh I represent root
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
Vapors we have four direct uh Vapor
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
related stores uh we do not sell
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes uh we don't sell any other
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
tobacco products uh one thing I think
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be clear is that I do not
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
believe Vapor Products are tobacco
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
products it's a nicotine product it is
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
only nicotine that you're ingesting it
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
is what is addictive uh but it does not
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
cause any of the concerns of the
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
American Cancer Society or the American
 
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.510 align:start position:0%
American Cancer Society or the American
Health

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
Association compared to traditional
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
combustible tobacco so I want to be
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
clear that I believe that this bill
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
represents a lump lumping two categories
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
of one industry the nicotine industry uh
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's fair to the vapor
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
industry whatsoever uh we've been fair
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
with the state throughout all means to
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
adhere to all regulations that have been
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
put forth we've work with you to assure
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we comply with taxation
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
lenser uh everything that should be done
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
in a normal business you expect that
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
from a good industry uh we try to
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
provide that what I would ask from you
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
now is if you're looking to increase
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
taxes or Revenue off of these it's an
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
easy solution there's already means of
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
collecting this tax I don't believe it's
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
being done properly I don't believe that
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting your full share uh I as a
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
small business owner see
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
larger businesses around me getting away
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
with fraud I am not going to be the one
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
that throws other industry people under
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
the bus but let me tell you they're not
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes simple as that so if
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
you're looking to increase it you're
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
just going to increase the black market
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to increase the amount of
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh Exodus from our sales here in the
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
state to other states or God forbid
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
online which you all think is not
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
existing any longer that is still a
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
viable option for these consumers uh if
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
you think that they can only buy this in
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
the store you're highly mistaken uh I
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear there is no
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
on a product that gives people a better
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
choice to use nicotine a healthier
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
choice we could do the homework I'll sit
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
down with anybody okay but this is a
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
devastating thing to have to happen and
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
if you want to get people off of tobacco
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
the first choice is going to an
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
alternative nicotine product that First
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
Choice should not be as expensive with
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
all the uh luggage that traditional
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco has carried for all these years
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is a new product it's been out for
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
about 20 years the cigarettes have been
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
out for 200 if you guys or if we can't
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
clearly separate the two when we move
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
forward with these sort of things then
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
we really need to expand our knowledge
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
on what we're dealing with it would be
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
like saying that uh uh alcohol is the
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
same as fruit juice okay there's there's
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
bad things with both okay but one does
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
harmful harmful things and one does some
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
not so good things
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to talk for 10 20
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
minutes I know you don't have the time
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
but I would be more than happy to sit
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
down with anybody to discuss a real
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
solution going forward for the vapor
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
industry here in the states to make your
 
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
industry here in the states to make your
Revenue

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
better thank you uh I have a question
 
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.070 align:start position:0%
better thank you uh I have a question
here

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
represent yeah thank you for your
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm curious about your
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
question your statement about the black
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
market do you characterize the black
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
market for Vaping in a percent of the
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
total Market
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
the black market had taken off
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 2018 2019 when the federal
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh regulations came into effect either
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
barring small businesses from offering a
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
product to their consumer or offering
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
new product to the market after that
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
date so it created a black market based
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
upon the accessibility of the need or
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
the want of the consumer to get this
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
access and the Federal Regulations Andor
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
state regulations taking away that
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
option so it basically was a an
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
immediate result of a federal regulatory
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh attack on the industry at the time if
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
they had taken a smaller steps that it's
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
called the pmta process of getting your
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
Market to mark your product to Market
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
properly they screwed it all up simple
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
as that and they created the Brock
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
Market follow followup please uh yeah my
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
question was the extent of the black
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
market is this like half your business
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
is Black Market or a small part or a
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
large part can you comment on
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
that if if we're talking about how much
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
loss Revenue you you're losing out on
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
the table it would be at least 50% at
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
least 50% I only know 50% of the
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
industry that's doing it right and
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
that's because there is no way that they
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
can do it the right way to be clear 30
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
cents per milliliter we were this is a
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
clear this is why tobacco and nicotine
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and cigarettes and Vapors 30 cents per
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
milliliter is one of the only states
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
that does this it's a very awkward way
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
of doing it at the time we had less than
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
one milliliter in a throwaway device
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
less than 1 milliliter approximately 30
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
cents per unit we're now talking about
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
units that have 20 to 25 milliters in
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
them you're talking a tax of $758 per
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
unit and guess what this is what we're
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the Lost Revenue they're
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
bringing these small devices in Black
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
Market to the state selling them without
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
a tax on it and you're losing out on the
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
revenue I'm not you can come to any one
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
of my stores and audit but if you did
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
that to every convenience store and Head
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
smoke shop in this city or this state
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
you would find an abundance of Il legal
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
for yes representative you said Thank
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Max for your
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh testimony is is there a way to S I'm
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to make one suggestion as you walk
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
from this building over to the
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
governor's office and and suggest uh to
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
one of her staffers that this is a
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
component that her new committee Co
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
might want to look at uh because
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
everybody should be paying their fair
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
share uh is there a way much like a pack
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes there's a tax stamp on the
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
bottom is there a way for a consumer to
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
walk into a into a storefront and ID
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
whether that tax has been
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
paid uh currently there is no way for
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
them to ticket or tab or sticker any
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
specific product that I'm aware of it is
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
something that could be done uh I know
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there would be a cost behind you
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
know tagging every single item that goes
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
out the door uh but currently no it is
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
on the onus of the distributor selling
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
into the state to collect the
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
that thank representative ORS so uh
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony so is it just the vaping
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
products that is the black market
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
problem is not the cigarette
 
01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
products I don't want to speak on a
 
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
since I do not handle any other uh
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
industry the tobacco is cigarettes and
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
vapor and since I don't sell cigarettes
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh I could just say that enough people
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
still get their cigarettes and as I had
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned like online you would might
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
not think it's available you might not
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a thing they still get
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
their products online but secondary as
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
to what I see people coming up the same
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
person that walks into my vapor store
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
will go to the next uh uh convenience or
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
gas station or tobacco retailer and buy
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
their cigarettes while they're here as
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
well they might have made the change to
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
Vapor their wife might still be on
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
cigarettes their parents might still be
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
on vapor and their kids are on
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and when I say kids it's a

cotton but yes we're seeing it but I

country that are not paying the tax
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%

wherever thank
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
is Kevin dagel and I am the President of
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Grocers Association uh
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
for those of you not familiar with our
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
group we represent both chain and
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
independent Grocery and convenience
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
stores here in New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
today to state that an increase in the
 
01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax will cause economic damage
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire will not raise tax
 
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
revenues for the state and will do
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
little to reduce smoking New Hampshire
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
spent years marketing itself as a
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly lowcost Haven to our
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and we currently
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
enjoy an advantage over those States
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the tax on cigarettes
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
this Advantage is one of the driving
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
factors for over 40% of sales being
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
attributed to crossb sales reducing this
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
Advantage not only drives cigarette
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
sales away but also drives the sales of
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
additional items away it's not uncommon
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
that when a customer comes to New
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to purchase cigarettes they
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
also spend money on other items such is
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
bear liquor Lottery groceries snacks gas
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
stops at a local restaurants stops at a
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
local shop by discouraging the consumer
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
from coming to New Hampshire you lose
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
out on those additional sales and the
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
taxes on those additional items when
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding states raise their cigarette
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
tax we see an increase in sales here in
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so it's not unrealistic to
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
expect the good portion of those sales
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
to leave when that pricing is no longer
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
advantageous they will stop coming to
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to purchase their cigarett
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
and this reduction in sales will almost
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
certainly have a negative impact on your
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
revenue and while the intent behind
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
increasing cigarette taxes may be to
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
reduce smoking evidence suggests that
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of tax increases
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
diminishes over time many smokers switch
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
to cheaper unregulated products negating
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
the health and revenues the revenue
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
goals of this tax policy in summary for
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
the reasons provided we cannot support
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
this bill we encourage the committee to
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 290 and find it
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you thank
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
you any
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
ol thank you for taking my question I
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate it um just a few
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
moments ago well maybe half an hour ago
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh we heard the uh two uh preeminent uh
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
societies fighting uh cigarette smoking
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
say exactly the opposite of what you're
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
saying uh do you have any um objective
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
evidence to that uh that there would be
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
a decrease in sales and anciliary sales
 
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
a decrease in sales and anciliary sales
as

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
well the advantage we have currently I
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
know the bill sponsor and others after
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
him spoke about proposed tax increases
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
in other states we have to go by what
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
the tax is today yeah proposals Hit or
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
Miss um by raising our tax right now
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
78% 78 cents more than main anything
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
along that border is going to see a
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
reduction in sales so it reducing that
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
that cost or increasing that cost is
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the traffic coming over
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Border somebody coming from
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's a dollar more is it
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
really advantageous for me to pay 25
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
bucks more for something where I can
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
stay close closer to home so I I I
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with them I I don't think
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see a decrease in sales and an
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
increase in tax you'll see a decrease in
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue representative SP thank you
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair where did you come up
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
with the 40% are out of state uh sales
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
where's that figure coming from y
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's several studies that actually
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
show it's 40 to
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
45% your very own Liquor Commission
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
touts that their sales from cross B
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
Sales anywhere from 50 to
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
55% okay followup follow up so we would
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
if if we raised it a dollar we wouldn't
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
see all 40% of that loss would
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
we it it depends upon the person you'd
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
see a good number of that loss depending
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
upon which side of the Border you're on
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
well but it appears that you wouldn't
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
see a complete if we did lose all 40% of
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that there would be about 60 million in
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we would lose in tax
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
revenue based on the total revenue from
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh tobacco can't hypothesize as to what
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
the percentage of that 40% loss would be
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you what the percentage of
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
those sales are and that's 40% of those
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
sales are cross B of of T of cigarettes
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
correct right so if we if we got if we
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
lost all that that would be about 60
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
million in tax revenue correct but his
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill would get us 87 million in tax
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
revenue so if we lost all that cross
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
border we'd still have more revenue from
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
the from the bill you'd also lose
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
additional sales people filling up on
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
gas stopping in a restaurant fall 40%
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um Mr Delo
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the 40% figure you cited that's not just
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
Maine correct that is that's all cross
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
crossb sales so that would include
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which would still be
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than um and and my
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
guess is composes a fairly subst
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
stantial portion of that
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
40% and it would include Vermont which
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
would I think we'd be 30 cents cheaper
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
if without you be 30 cents cheaper I
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's 30 cents cheaper
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
just on a pack of cigarettes and and I
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
and I assume as somebody else has
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out ront also has a sales tax
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
correct so that the the actual cost to
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer would be more than that 30
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
cents if they were buying it in Vermont
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
versus buying it in the Hampshire you
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
get to a Tipping Point of what justifies
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
me jumping in my car and making that
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
that drive to to the other state thank
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
you and that's different for
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
everyone repres to said Thank you Mr
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm going to offer this
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
question and maybe I should have asked
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
it earlier to anybody that may be coming
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
up to speak and maybe to some of the
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
previous speakers we're talking a lot

about the um efforts that we are
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
required to take to stop the black
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
market in
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco uh has nothing to do with
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
vaping uh and in order to be able to
 
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:25.960 align:start position:0%

that comes from the tobacco
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
settlement uh that money seems a little

currently chairman of the oil fund
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
dispersement board in New Hampshire I'm
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
speaking today in opposition of HB 290
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
because I operate New Hampshire stores
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
and in neighboring states I'm able to
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
speak pretty knowledgy about how to
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
state tobacco policy can quickly impact
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
where customers choose to buy their
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
products and other sales as was
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned for example when
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts raised its tobacco tax to
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
350 1 our Massachusetts St store saw a
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
sharp decrease 15 to 18% in tobacco
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
sales and as I mentioned every customer
 
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
that comes into one of our retail
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
convenience stores buys approximately 11
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
to $14 of additional goods and services
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
not um excluding gasoline so that went
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
away okay so that's a revenue loss to us
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was the benefit my New
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stores reap the benefit of
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
that I should note when Massachusetts
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
band flavored tobacco in 2020 our stores
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
in Vermont New Hampshire saw a dramatic
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
increase in sales while Massachusetts
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
suffered the consequences and now are
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with a as has been previously
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned a pretty significant Black
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
Market problem because they eliminated
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
Menthol which contributes to 20 to 25%
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
of our cigarette
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
Sales New Hampshire more than any other
 
01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
state New England has gotten tobacco tax
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
policy right by maintaining a relatively
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
low excise tax we've been able to
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
capitalize on our autate visitors by
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining a relatively
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
low to take make their purchases in
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
doing so we've pulled in outof state tax
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
dollars uh without burdening our instate
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
residents in fact the recent tax
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
Foundation study published back in
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
December of 24 states that New Hampshire
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
has been the recipient of $950 million
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
dollars so the same thoughtful policy is
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in the way we currently tax
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
Vape products uh a bifurcated tax of 30
 
01:27:33.149 --> 01:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
cents per milliliter for closed and 8%
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
for open is the fairest way to tax these
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
products moving to a 65% tax wholesale
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
price only gives our regional tax
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
advantage away uh B by my math it makes
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
us uncompetitive with Maine and also
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont based on that new tax rate my
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
advice don't change a thing as our newly
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
elected governor aot said don't m things
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
up I urge you to move forward with this
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
bill and consider the negative
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
consequences of proposed tax increases
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
on tobacco products uh thank you very
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
much I'd be glad to answer any
 
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.629 align:start position:0%
much I'd be glad to answer any
questions

01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
much um I may not be saying this right
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
right but the last one I hear
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
is oh
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
Scot y my name is Brett Scott and the
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%

my
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
businesses I just want to touch
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
primarily on The Vape piece that there
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
was a Senate Bill 433 which formed a
 
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
committee to study the tax collection uh
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
for Vape
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
products and they themselves all voted
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of you know having this
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
committee and we are expecting a Senate
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
bill to uh change the way that the tax
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
is collected and who enforces it this is
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
a major issue in the state right now
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes have attack stamp there is
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
tight control of of making sure that
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
those products have been taxed when
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're in the retail stores these Vape
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
products that is not the case there is
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
no trackability the current audit
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
process is a joke that we have in the
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
state there are millions of dollars
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
being left on the table I heard someone
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
ask what the amount is now obviously
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to say but I wanted to
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
get some information so a while ago I
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
started pushing on this issue I
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
requested information of what the state
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
had actually collected in Vape tax and I
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
found that my 11 stores that I have in
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because I have stores in
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
Maine and New Hampshire my 11 stores in
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're paying
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
26% of the tax that's being collected
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
for Vape here in the state of New
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now my ego would love to think
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we have 26% market share in the
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
state that is not the case it is not
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
realistic there are hundreds of licensed
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco retailers these Vape taxes are
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
being paid by you know convenience
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
stores smoke shops all that many of you
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
probably wonder how are there so many
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
smoke shops when you drive down certain
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
strips that is primarily because these
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
guys are evading the taxes and is
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
extremely lucrative because they are
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
keeping not only their cut but your cut
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
this is a major problem now you would
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
think when you look at this 8% cuz I
 
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
hear that getting pushed around a lot
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
that well that's not a significant
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
number 30 cents a milliliter is where
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
the real tax money is that's a lot more
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
than 8% sure 8% might have been a
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
smaller amount to start this and 30
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
cents a milliliter was you know seen as
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
that too as the market changed that 30
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
cents per milliliter became a
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount of tax and often is
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
resulting an extremely high tax on these
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
products and again making it very
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
lucrative for those that aren't paying
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
so first I would ask that I'm hopeful
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the Senate bill will come through
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
and changing how it's collected enforce
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
it and I would love to be a part of that
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
because this is a major problem in the
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
state before we raise the tax I would
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
love for us to have a process that truly
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
audits these people I would ask if you
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
came into this room today and if the
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
heat wasn't working if you would turn it
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
on or turn around and try to get an
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
entirely new HVAC system turned on uh
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
installed because it's the same type of
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
thing we need to fix what we already
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
have before we go and increase it and
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
put us that are actually following the
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
rules you know at a huge disadvantage
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
and jeopardize our businesses to these
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
people that aren't doing it right so I'd
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent El thank you very
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
much for taking uh my question uh we've
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit today about uh the
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
issue of tax evasion and and fraud
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
against the state um
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that may exist and
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
the reporting by the various uh bodies
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
sincere however do you have any um
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
anything other than anecdotal
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
information that we could use yeah I
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
mean I think the greatest example I say
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
is the fact of I I pulled this
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
information from Dr of how much are they
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
collecting per month and I know how much
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm paying in tax and when I did those
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm paying 26% of what the state
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
is collecting of Vape tax and I'm
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
selling that out of 11 stores here in
 
01:32:58.199 --> 01:32:59.109 align:start position:0%
selling that out of 11 stores here in
the

01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
state there's hundreds of license
 
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.750 align:start position:0%
state there's hundreds of license
tobacco

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
retailers okay thank you very much for
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
where you got your data I appreciate
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
that that thank you gives us a place to
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
start thank
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
you any other questions what percent of
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
the market do you think you
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
are I my last understanding was there
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
was around 900 licensed tobacco
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
retailers in this state so I would think
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
that I
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
well below 5% um I think even that would
 
01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.270 align:start position:0%
well below 5% um I think even that would
be

01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
exaggerating so okay all right thank you
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay oh we I'm sorry
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
we have one more question represent yes
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
thank you do you remember the number of
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
the bill and this was this year's bill
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
or last year's Bill last year it was
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 433 is what tasked them to
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
have the committee to study this oh oh
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I think that's the way that uh
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is pushing something out
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
from N I agree with that which I'm
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
signed on to okay thank you great thank
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
you okay last but not least I have
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome thank you Mr chairman
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Jennifer
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
Ramsey I'm tax policy counsil with the
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue new Administration
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
and this is Lauren O Sullivan she's our
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
senior financial analyst um we're just
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
handing out to you a quick guide we
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
contributed to the fiscal note for this
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill um and that provides you with just
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit more information about how
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
we arrived at our
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
calculations um you may recall that the
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner told you yesterday that the
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax is really three taxes
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's the tobacco stamp sales there's
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products and then there
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
are ecigarettes um this bill only
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
touches the tobacco stamps sales and the
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes and would raise the rates
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
for for both of those products um we
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
analyzed the fiscal impact of the
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation by looking at
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
simply fiscal year 24 sales data um we
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
did not make any adjustments for the
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
possible impact um of increased or
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
decreased sales that changing the rate
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
of tax might uh provide so looking
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
strictly at fiscal year 24 data we
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
calculated that um a change in the
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco stamp rate of a dollar um would
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
result in approximately 87.5 million of
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for New Hampshire uh
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
assuming sales stayed steady and we
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
calculated that with respect to um The
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
increased rate for wholesale ecigarette
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
products um there would be an increase
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
in approximately $3 million per um year
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
in sales we were not able to calculate
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh an increase for the
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
um open systems yes for sorry for the
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
closed systems because those are taxed
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
on a per millimeter basis and this
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would change those to a
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale price our tax system does not
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
capture the wholesale price of those
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
products it only captures the per
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
millimeter price so there would probably
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
be an additional impact that we're not
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
able to calculate with the data that we
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
have um and if there are questions I'm
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take those yes
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
represent um yeah a couple in different
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
topics uh the first topic is since it's
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
fresh in my mind and may disappear in a
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
couple of seconds uh the gentleman that
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
was just up here uh spoke about uh
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
comparative data uh that he obtained is
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
it possible that Dr could provide us
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
with that uh analysis as to how how many
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
smoke shops exist that sell vaping
 
01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
smoke shops exist that sell vaping
products

01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
that pardon legal Le well that was the
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
next line you understand where I'm going
 
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
with with that particular line of
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
questioning and I think both sides uh
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
would uh appreciate uh receiving that uh
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
data from uh directly from Dr as to the
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
shops that sell it and the shops that
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
pay the taxes on it right so um yes we
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
can provide you with that information
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
the retailers are currently licensed by
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
the um Liquor Commission and we license
 
01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.669 align:start position:0%
the um Liquor Commission and we license
the

01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
wholesalers um so that I believe that
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
retail data is also available uh we'll
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to get that from The Liquor
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
Commission but they can provide that
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
information for you I would yes I would
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate coordinating with the other
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
agencies the necessary to provide that
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
information um and the other question I
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
have if I might follow up follow up uh
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any data based on uh sales
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
or tax stamp sales uh regarding an
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
increase in price Visa the increase in
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
sales so if we increase the sales tax is
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
there an increase decrease in sales
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
compared to revenues um so with the
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
analysis we did we did not look at what
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
the effect on the volume of sales would
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
be based on a price increase um and I've
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony from people
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
here today I don't disagree that there
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
would be some impact
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability within what
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
what we know uh to be able to calculate
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
that number I think the commissioner
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
told you yesterday that we we are um
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
45th in of the 50 states in terms of um
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
being a uh a state where people from out
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
of state come here to purchase
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and you've heard a lot of
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
testimony about the price differences
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
between um the tax here versus around in
 
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
our surrounding states I think it's fair
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
to assume that there would be some um
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
reduction in sales but maybe not um as
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
much as you would see if you started to
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
raise our tax rates to closer to our
 
01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.430 align:start position:0%
raise our tax rates to closer to our
neighboring

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
states okay thank you representative
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question shame on me I've read
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
the reports before but it just notice
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
that the the revenue line for the it's
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
for open systems is there a way to get a
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
static analysis on closed systems any
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
way to see what that actual revenue is
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
because we're hearing testimony that at
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
some level there's uh evasion and tax
 
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
being paid so so with respect to the um
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
the closed systems that are priced on a
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
per milliliter basis um we were asked to
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
look at that uh during the study
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee this summer as well um that
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
was created under SP 433 um we don't
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
have the information that we need to do
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we would need to have wholesale
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
pricing data from resellers we have
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
volumes within our system but we don't
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
have the price the wholesale price of
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
those products so we would need to reach
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
out to wholesalers to get that price
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
information follow up follow up does
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
that make sense to you in any way shap
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
or form to to do it that way or would
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
would you have a suggestion as to how we
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
could track this more appropriately Dr
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
can come to us with a with a number and
 
01:40:57.589 --> 01:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
say this is what the revenue is are you
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
looking for a fiscal impact for the the
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh closed systems that are sold on a per
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
Mill M millimeter basis yes what what
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
what the actual tax revenue for 24 was
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know bottom bottom line number sorry
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
we do have the data for the revenue for
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
24 I'm sorry I thought you were talking
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
about the the impact of this legislation
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
but you can separate the open and closed
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
systems okay I'm wondering why it's not
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
here do you do have that with
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
us split between the so the the reason
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's not on the reason it's not on the
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or the quick guide is
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't calculate the tax
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
impact but um I know we do provide
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
monthly the breakout between um between
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
the open and
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually we we could um I I can email
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
the committee the breakout between the
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
open and close I know that was requested
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday during the presentation that
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
has been prepared okay thank you sorry
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
it wasn't yesterday today thank you Mr
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um and and
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for this I'm
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
assuming um and and maybe I shouldn't do
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe I should simply ask you um uh
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
to I'm assuming you could prepare a
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
history of the tobacco tax I'm assuming
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been at its current level in
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
perpetuity um and that we've raised it
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
before the state has raised it before
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
assuming again that having that history
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
that we could take a look back at
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
whenever we last raised the sales the
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
the the tax on Tobacco that we could
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
also look at sales prior to that tax
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
increase and after that would give us at
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
least some ability to understand what
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
might happen not that not that history
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
is always as what what are
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
the investment guides say you know
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
history is no guarantee of future
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
results but um but certainly you know it
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
might give us a guide is that possible
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
sure so I believe the uh tobacco stamp
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
tax has been at the same rate since
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
2008 um and so we would have been on a
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
different Revenue system you heard
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday about our Revenue information
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
system that would have been the old
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
Tim's system I'm not sure how much
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
detail data we can get but certainly on
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
an aggregate basis we could look at data
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
from those years um and and provide you
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
with some sense of how the revenue
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
changed when that rate changed um the
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
ecigarette product rates have just been
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
in effect since 2020 and that data that
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have is it hasn't changed so
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well obviously it may be imperfect
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
it may be imperfect but I think it would
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
be helpful um along with the request
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
Brier uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh I had a
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
quick question about regarding the te
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
potential tax evasion on the U
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes um are you familiar with um
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
the tobacco uniformity project being
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
done by the Federation of tax
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
administrators yes um
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
followup uh my question is um do you
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
have any data in there that talks about
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
the best way to reduce tax evasion on
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
the ecigarettes um through Federation of
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
tax administrators as like a best
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
practices guide would you be able to
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
committee you remember that right right
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah um we can we can look and see what
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
we have and provide you what we can find
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
you now I think we are all said Thank
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
you okay that concludes uh today's
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else that
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out a pin card who would
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
something okay with that I will close
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%

01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
room with a bill that is a good bill and
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's a very bipartisan bill um with a
 
01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:29.550 align:start position:0%
it's a very bipartisan bill um with a
number

01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
of you up there
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
um uh part of the process that led to
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and some of you on on the bill
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
itself um so
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's House Bill 328 I'm introducing
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm the prime sponsor there are
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of uh
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors uh senators and state reps
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the ease with which I had uh
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
in gathering support for this bill meant
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
that I didn't have to do anything uh it
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
was great uh and representative om by
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
the way uh welcome back uh it's good to
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
see you um so this uh
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
reflects change in the gaming systems
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
the gaming
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
industry gaming practices here in New
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um has uh transformed the
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
industry I believe just in the past few
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
years um and I think it dates to the
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
time when uh it became possible for
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
gaming operat ERS to um
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
open their Halls that they had or the
 
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
open new halls um and put in place the
 
01:53:06.589 --> 01:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
machines that uh enabled a new way of
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
doing business um and uh I imagine that
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
in your Revenue uh work that you're
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
seeing more Revenue coming in um uh via
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
the his course racing um uh activity uh
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
than you might have expected um so um
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
background uh last year uh it's really
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
last uh session two-year
 
01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.510 align:start position:0%
last uh session two-year
session

01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
um a commission that's the predecessor
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
the to the commission that's proposed in
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
this bill um was set up and uh members
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
of that worked hard representative
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
janigian was on that representative
 
01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:02.830 align:start position:0%
janigian was on that representative
duet

01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
was it and if it wasn't speak up um and
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
it was chaired by Patrick abrami and
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
another um former member of this
 
01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
committee uh he did an excellent job and
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
um and worked very hard as did uh the
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
rest of us and uh another uh person who
 
01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
was on the that commission who's who's
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh Gone on uh to to uh more relaxed
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
life I hope is Senator
 
01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
dallesandro um so we had quite a quite a
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
group and uh we had some money and with
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
that money um the uh Spectrum
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the full title
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh Spectrum gaming group uh was
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
hired and uh did a lot of good work for
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
us so as background I want to say that
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have I think it's been passed around
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
a copy of the report of
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
the gaming
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
commission what you don't have but I
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand I understand that you can get
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
it are are the two reports that came out
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
of the work of this gaming commission
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
the two reports from the spectrum that
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
came out of the work of this uh
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
commission one is a a gaming market
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
analysis and Regulatory assessment
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's my copy there and U the other is
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
a social impact study overview of
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
responsible gaming and problem gambling
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
best practices in the United
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
States lots lots of interesting
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
important information in both of these
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
reports um and I encourage you to read
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
them I they are available online and I I
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
think Jen has uh uh giv you information
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
on how to get at them um but I'll leave
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
that between you and Jen to figure that
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
one out um so lots of information and
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
lots of incomplete work that couldn't be
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
done last year and that's why this bill
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
is before you um it's uh House Bill 328
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a charitable gaming
 
01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:32.709 align:start position:0%
establishing a charitable gaming
oversight

01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
commission um it
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
um it would set up this commission for a
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
10-year period of
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
time uh so it's a a long it was it's
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
truly a standing oversight commission
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
with uh a series of duties obligations
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
expectations basic basically a charge to
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
the commission that's in the uh
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
legislation and um with a membership
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
that's that uh has nine voting members
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
and another six non- voting members the
 
01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
voting members are all from the
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislature I believe and um and the
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
other six are from
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
outside uh and is designed to ensure
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
input not just from those who benefit
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
from or participate in uh chable gaming
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
right now but uh to the broader public
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh so that uh uh truly all perspectives
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
can be heard and and uh be present in
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
the uh thinking and activities of the
 
01:57:47.679 --> 01:57:51.109 align:start position:0%
the uh thinking and activities of the
commission

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think what I'll do because I
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
know there are a few other people who uh
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
may want to talk and uh and that uh the
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
lunch hour is just about upon us um is
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
just to go through the charge to this
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
commission and um urge you to uh
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
to uh vote favorably for the bill um
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
with whatever small changes you may wish
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
to make I do while I think of it I want
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
to point out there is one mistake just a
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
drafting error I think um on page two
 
01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.990 align:start position:0%
drafting error I think um on page two
line

01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
19 of the bill um it should be part two
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
one sure you got that um so uh the
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
charges uh uh in the overall char charge
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:04.109 --> 02:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
our changes needed to address problem
 
02:00:06.669 --> 02:00:06.679 align:start position:0%
gambling um definitely needs to be
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
addressed I urge you to look at this
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
social impact study and think about it
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
um changes that may be needed to
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
restructure or modify systems for
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
allocating and overseeing the use of
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
funds granted to the state and to
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
Charities and gaming operations ERS
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
participating in um this this gambling
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
activity um and then uh a third one
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's very important I think I think
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is going to require thought and I
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh that'll be interested to follow the
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh changes needed to prevent undue
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
concentration or prolifer or
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
proliferation of gaming locations
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
facilities and ownership including a
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
municipal option oped into or out of
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
components of charal gaming
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
um I think you must know that uh that
 
02:01:05.229 --> 02:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
the casinos that have been developed in
 
02:01:10.069 --> 02:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
this um state in the last two or three
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
or four years just very quickly um are
 
02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
largely owned by outside uh of the of
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
State owners and um have Consolidated
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
down to just a few
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
um that's worth taking a look at what
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
are the implications of that what can we
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
do about
 
02:01:28.199 --> 02:01:29.790 align:start position:0%
do about
it

02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh there is this possibility the
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh gaming uh report from Spectrum this
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
large report suggests that there's no
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
real reason not to
 
02:01:47.069 --> 02:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
call um historic horse racing what it
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
really is which is um gambling by slot
 
02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.390 align:start position:0%
really is which is um gambling by slot
machine

02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
machine
and

02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and move over to um
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
enable allow slot machines in New
 
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and thereby avoid the software
 
02:02:08.069 --> 02:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
fees and other fees that are associated
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
right now with running historic horse
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
racing machines and then capture that
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
money that's quite a lot of money so
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
think about that uh slot machines uh in
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
the minds of of uh a large number of
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire do not have uh
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
do not sound good as you see it doesn't
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a good sound um but maybe uh we
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
need to get over that since it's
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
basically the same of what as what it's
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
been authorized a little faster but
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise the
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
same um so that's worth thinking about
 
02:02:45.079 --> 02:02:46.270 align:start position:0%
same um so that's worth thinking about
and

02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
um I think this commission is is needed
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
one other aspect of the the problem is
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh charal gaming all of a sudden we're
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
getting a lot more money flowing into uh
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
the the uh slot that's for charitable
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
Charities for Charities to be allocated
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
to Charities it's a lot of money and
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
who's that money going to is going to
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
the Charities that have managed to get
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
on to the list at uh these casinos how
 
02:03:19.229 --> 02:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
do they get onto that casin that list
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
what are the standards uh who picks them
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
um who gets the best days who gets the
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
worst days and so forth and so on it's a
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
lot of money there that is uh right now
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
flowing um pursuant to choices that are
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
made by the gaming operators because
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are making the
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
choices there's really no no standard in
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
place in the law uh that governs those
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh questions that I just raised so um
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's another aspect of the need for
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
this commission it's really a very
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
important issue so that's the way I'll
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
leave it uh I hope that you'll support
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh send it forward and if
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
there's any fixes that are need needed I
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
I uh I welcome
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
ery thank you representative Ames and
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you again for another uh well put
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
together Bill uh just to syis real
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
quickly this bill is uh put together to
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
indicate that um from a study committee
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
the study committee unanimously uh
 
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
author or study commission authorized
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
and suggested to the legislature that
 
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
the commission be reauthorized
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
reinstituted for a 10-year period to
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
discuss the Myriad issues that you had
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh that you raised in here as a cause
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
for the committee not to be addressed by
 
02:04:51.239 --> 02:04:52.750 align:start position:0%
for the committee not to be addressed by
this

02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh directly but for the commission to
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
address is that correct that is correct
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
and the second question I have
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
followup would be uh do you find that
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
the uh the error on line 19 page two was
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
clerical in nature therefore a
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
scribner's error therefore could be
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
you representative duet thank you Mr
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and I thank my friend and
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
colleague from Jeffrey I I know and the
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
work this committee has done over the
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
last bunch of years the scope and scale
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
of charitable
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
gaming needs this okay needs this and it
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
it would take a ream of paper this thick
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
if we were go to go through issue by
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
issue as to what is fair and Equitable
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
and charitable gaming in relation to the
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
charities quickly reading over this and
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
I've co-sponsored this with you and
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're well aware we're we're going to
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
see as a committee a lot of gaming bills
 
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh I've authed a couple but but my issue
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
here specifically and shame on me for
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
not touching Bas with you earlier is the
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
voting members you have two members of
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate five members of the house but
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
you also have the executive director of
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery and the AG voting and I know
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
that in our commission over the summer
 
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:22.679 align:start position:0%
they abstained from that and and that
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
would be a change that I would want to
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
make in this in that they they probably
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be voting members of this
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
commission um just throwing it out there
 
02:06:33.159 --> 02:06:34.270 align:start position:0%
commission um just throwing it out there
yeah

02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
I um well thank you for uh pointing out
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
that issue um I think that uh I'm fine
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
either way I think they're invaluable
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
members of the commission um my
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
experience going back many years to the
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
time when I chaired um the big
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
Commission on uh casino gambling back in
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
2013 something like that
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
um with a commission that included the
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
attorney general who was obligated by
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
the bill that it passed uh to be
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
present personally present at all the uh
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
Casino meetings and uh and the lottery
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
director was also a member was said
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
again that they they were both
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
invaluable to the work of the uh
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
commission and it's okay with me if
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
there's a design possibility but uh it
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
can go either way I I'm sure they'll
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
contribute either way and as you pointed
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
out uh the um on most issues they would
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
abstain they would not vote because of
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh that tradition thank you just to
 
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah I don't want to paint
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
them into a corner or give them any
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
exposure and I think it's the duty of
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
the legisl legislature to make what
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
decisions need to be made in this
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
commission that's yeah I'm fine with
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
that so I totally agree the value is is
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
beyond you know but they need to be
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
involved so that that's my only concern
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
there we have at present no guard
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
rails on these machines for people that
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
are uh addicted and playing addicted and
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
cannot get off of it and there are other
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
things that I'm sure in this report that
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
are things that that many people would
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
probably like
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
that that the companies that the three
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
companies that are now in charge of all
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
of these machines um would not like to
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
see and I am wondering if since they
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
are almost completely slot machines uh
 
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
hold that gift to them Hostage to
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
negotiate guard rails and the other
 
02:09:31.069 --> 02:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
items that the commission thought were
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
impose um any
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are many ways to go
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
forward and uh um there doesn't have to
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
be um this is going to be a process
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
number one it's complicated uh problem
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
gambling is complicated and it's uh diff
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
difficult difficult to get at I think uh
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
the truth is that many of the gaming
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
operators would like to
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
um uh will'll be on the side of Reform
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
and uh introduction into the system of a
 
02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
number of interventions that our
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
neighboring state in Massachusetts uh
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
utilizes uh for example and uh they've
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
got big time gaming operators so I think
 
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
I think that the resistance will not be
 
02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%
what you um suggested there um maybe at
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
the margins it will be but uh and maybe
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
the margins are most important I don't
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
know um but uh I I'd say go ahead and
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
try to develop the best possible uh um
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
program for um helping those who have
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
the addiction that you mentioned uh and
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
those who engage otherwise in at a
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
problematic level in uh gambling and um
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
develop the interventions that make
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
sense and uh I don't know about holding
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
hostage that's sort of a different kind
 
02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
hostage that's sort of a different kind
of

02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
strategy representative Malloy thank you
 
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
question representative Ames it is nice
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
to see you there thank you for the work
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh I serve on two nonprofit boards that
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
have benefited from the uh charitable
 
02:11:23.639 --> 02:11:25.310 align:start position:0%
have benefited from the uh charitable
gaming

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
Arrangement uh and they've in my the
 
02:11:34.109 --> 02:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
questions I get about this is the how
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
how Charities are chosen to uh receive
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
benefit should this H commission be
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
established and that question get
 
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
established and that question get
addressed

02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh how long a period of time are we
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
looking looking at before we could see
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
something down on paper if at all about
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
what those rules and regulations could
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
be and and how and I realize that's a
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
question that's probably maybe
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
impossible to answer but if you could
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
take a stab at it I appreciate well I uh
 
02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.750 align:start position:0%
take a stab at it I appreciate well I uh
I

02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
share what I guess is your view and I
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
know representative Aly suggested this
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
too in her
 
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
question uh the the feeling that
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that we're already late in
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
addressing um many many issues in this
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh um sort of astonishing rise of uh of
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh machine gambling in in New Hampshire
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
and um and so the sooner the better but
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
how you get there I'm not sure um and I
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
don't know whether there's a particular
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow one part or
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
another of this uh to be addressed
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
separately uh I'd like to see the whole
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
thing addressed particularly chart CH
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling or or problem
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
gambling however you want to phrase it
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
um the sooner the better on that but
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's got to be done
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
right yes represent
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair and it's
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you back uh just to
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on that I I believe we've
 
02:13:23.229 --> 02:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
talked about this this in the last term
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
but when we're when this commission
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
would be looking at selection of
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
Charities would there be
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
criteria for
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
example one of the groups that I know
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
because they told me benefits from
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is the New Hampshire
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
State Police bagpipe band now I I think
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
they do I enjoy bagpipe music as opposed
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
to many who don't but it seems to me odd
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
that basically the state is giving them
 
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
money to play the bag pipes at events as
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to that money going to things
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
like uh organizations that provide
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
health care or shelter or educational
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities so I'm wondering if part
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
of what you would be looking at would be
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
why would we choose this kind of Charity
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
another well well that's that's the
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
problem there is no standard right now
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to establish
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
standards because some people will say
 
02:14:38.669 --> 02:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
we should always should be prioritizing
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh bag pipes you know or something
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
comparable who's going to pick and
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
choose can you set up a system that will
 
02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
do the picking and choosing that's
 
02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
generally thought to be a fair system um
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't know these these are
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
questions that didn't need to be asked
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
before when the level of charal gaming
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
was small now they really need to be
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
answered because there a lot of money
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
flowing to this that or the other
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
charity just because they happen to be
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the door the first before some other
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
people or some other organization and uh
 
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
um I think it's going to be tough making
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
those choices um I don't know yeah thank
 
02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
you yes um represent and Then followed
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
by thank you Mr chair and just in the
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
interest of time we we could talk for
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
hours about that that's part of the
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
purpose and correct me if I'm if I'm
 
02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
wrong representative but that's part of
 
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose who's going to pick winners
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
and losers we can't pick winners or
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
losers a charity is a charity whether
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's bag pipes stove pipes it's it's a
 
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
charity and that's that's my
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
understanding or at least the position
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from that needs to be a fair
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Equitable way to distribute the
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
funds also keeping in mind and we've
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
spoken about it in this committee
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
Charities that have been on board since
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
2006 I think it was or 2008 the
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
so-called Legacy Charities that have
 
02:16:09.549 --> 02:16:09.559 align:start position:0%
built out Service
 
02:16:13.549 --> 02:16:13.559 align:start position:0%
delivery from from charitable gaming and
 
02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
provide a service to residents of our
 
02:16:19.229 --> 02:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
communities built on revenue for this so
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be a balancing act
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm I'm wrong but it's
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
going to be a balancing act and it's
 
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
going to be labor intensive uh
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and everybody has to have
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
buying in this and and make sure it's
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable because of the the
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
scope of gaming at this point every
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
charity in the state wants to get
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
involved and rightfully so let let's see
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
how we can best deliver those dollars
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
dolls that this commission should do
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
that if there was a question to me I I
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
agree would you I kept asking if if I'm
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect that was a would you
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
believe um yes I mean I was I was on
 
02:17:01.709 --> 02:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
this commission as well and through the
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
commission we found there were more and
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
more questions coming up and and that's
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that this bill is
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
here because we want to start answering
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
these questions um I'd like to think
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ames has the answers to
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
all these things but uh we will uh
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully what the what the
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing commission will will accomplish
 
02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:23.230 align:start position:0%
ongoing commission will will accomplish
so

02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:26.429 align:start position:0%
so
yes

02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative um to add to The
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act I would think too there
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
should be um oh good to see you thank
 
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question comment um do
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
you think the list should also include
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
um some kind of protocol for when one of
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
these sites closes or when another one
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
opens you mean a g a gambling site yeah
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
eventually yeah
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes well yes I think uh um that gets to
 
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
yes well yes I think uh um that gets to
how

02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
many there should be and
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
um the degree to which there's
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
regulation and placement
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
and size I mean there there are lots of
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
questions that are out there and uh
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
right now we've sort of got we've sort
 
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
of got a moratorium on the
 
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
number um that's supposed to go away
 
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
then what and there's uh another issue
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's in in this bill about uh opt in
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
or opt out for municipalities and uh so
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
lot and what about municipalities
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're already there and then uh then a
 
02:18:40.110 --> 02:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
town opts out you know
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
what what about that situation
 
02:18:44.589 --> 02:18:44.599 align:start position:0%
representative home knows that issue
 
02:18:47.549 --> 02:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
well these are these are a lot of uh
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
good and important questions and I would
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
encourage uh once this commission does
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
get uh restarted that people pay
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
attention to it and you know be involved
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe make suggestions um one more
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
question that I want to move on thank
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I I just have one one
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
quick question I'm I'm just curious
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
I the thinking whether it was a a
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
decision or there is some law regarding
 
02:19:18.669 --> 02:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh making the four citizens with no
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
financial interest non- voting members
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having some citizen voting
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.070 --> 02:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
was yeah a fair question I uh
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um just was trying to make it un uh
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
wieldy rather than
 
02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
unwieldy I think that's probably where
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
that comes from as I thought it through
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
I thought uh we surely needed to have uh
 
02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
the representatives and Senators um and
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they I thought they should take the
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
lead but they should but the citizen
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
citizen involvement should be set up in
 
02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
a way that the citizens would always be
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
there as part of the discussion on the
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
voting it's my thought
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%

meeting true I was there um what a
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
privilege it is to be here to talk to

ways and means I'm Dr Deborah Warner I'm
from

02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
Littleton and um I'm an interested
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
citizen I did attend all of the meetings
 
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
in 20124 of the previous commission it
 
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
was incredibly interesting and I I was
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
able to get the car started this morning
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
at 21 Below and I know representative
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
Tierney probably had it even
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
colder oh well it must have been quite a
 
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
breeze off of our the river then um
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for listening to me I
 
02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
did pass out a um a testimony and it's
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
written and I have some
 
02:22:16.990 --> 02:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
notes and I will take off my glasses to
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
see the notes so um I think that this is
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
a very very good idea to reiterate the
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
commission that's already been in place
 
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
and also to give it a life of 10 years
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
it might need longer but you will decide
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
that in 10 years I think I think it's
 
02:22:36.429 --> 02:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
like um parent teacher conference in the
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
developing uh industry here this
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
industry is Young it is in its formative
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
years there are uh more local players
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
now and investors
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
are scoping us out and there will be
 
02:22:54.030 --> 02:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
more oh dear something's coming in on my
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
phone and getting in my hearing I'm
 
02:22:59.150 --> 02:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
sorry um and so there are going to be
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
some larger more experienced players
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
coming into New Hampshire and they will
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
have an influence as well and I think it
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
will be very important that the state
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on how things are developing
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
and there were just so many things that
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
the commission did in the report you saw
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
it it's like 24 26 items that are are
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
part of the reporting that came out um
 
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
as a just a citizen who attended I had
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
the privilege of being able to speak to
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
the commission several times I spoke
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
about local option I also spoke about
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a psychologist by the way and I um
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
have a history in for 15 years heading a
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit counseling center I was able
 
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
to speak about the community standards
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
the industry standards for granting
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
Charities and um
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
how things are how they are selected for
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
Grants the accountability the reporting
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
out the type of submission and the
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
criteria that would be involved and I
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
was very glad that that became a point
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
to consider in the the next um in the
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
report and in this bill uh one of the
 
02:24:11.269 --> 02:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
things that will be studied and um
 
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
reported out on the uh charitable
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
selection process I it's clearly
 
02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
important to all of us that the money
 
02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's channeled through the state is
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
going for good purposes that serve the
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
communities and the best interests of
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
the most people and and the dire needs
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I would like to make a suggestion I
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
think you can see it in my notes that I
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
would like that the public members um
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
that they be voting members I think that
 
02:24:45.389 --> 02:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
it helps the voice and the input and the
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
output of the commission have a very
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
good depth and breadth of quality
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
and uh I would very much appreciate that
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
being considered I would be very welcome
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about those things another thing
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that I spoke about was um problem
 
02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
gambling that is an issue you know these
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
these um casinos that have the ones with
 
02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
machines make about $20 million or more
 
02:25:15.269 --> 02:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
multiples of that in a year and the
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
amount of money allocated for problem
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
gambling program is in the neighborhood
 
02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
gambling program is in the neighborhood
of

02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and we it was pointed out we
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
need to have measures of how many
 
02:25:31.469 --> 02:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers are there and what
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
happens and how they affect the
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
community and and what kinds of programs
 
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
are good for them uh there's sort of a
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
hotline that's available and that people
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
who say they need help they could
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps be referred I did stand up at
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%

no one raised their hand among
 
02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
psychologists I didn't go to the other
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
professions but um we need to make sure
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%

02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
done so um there we
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing thank you very much

02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire lottery here director
 
02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:31.230 align:start position:0%

McIntyre

02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
McIntyre
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
arago good afternoon Mr chairman uh
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
Charlie marar live director I know it's
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
late so I'll be fast um
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
kulia Royo Chief compliance officer at
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
the lottery um so the words at design
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
exist in the bill and you're looking at
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
the design because I've done seven of
 
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
these and i' have no problem um not
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
obviously be involved but I'm kidding
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
but most importantly I would ask if you
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to have this commission that you
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
fund it as well I don't know there's any
 
02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism currently there and
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to need you're gon to have
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
expenses so I would imagine you'd want
 
02:27:18.269 --> 02:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
to fund at some level that's decision up
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
to you that's all I that's all I okay
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on child gambling
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
right now I know it's late so I just
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I know it's not
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
this committee regarding funding but
 
02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
certainly it's important that you be
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
funded the the last bill Crea the last
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
Commission Now that you mentioned that
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
did have funding in it it did yes it had
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was $150,000 annually
 
02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.150 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was $150,000 annually
and

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
non-aps you think and it was expense of
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
the lottery we we we paid the bill and
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
it was the bill obviously contains
 
02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
administratively tied to us uh so our
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
our CFO and his Department paid the
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
bills but I just want to make sure that
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
if you pass the commission okay so this
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill this Bill yes doesn't mention that
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
um okay well it's a good point yeah uh
 
02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
um okay well it's a good point yeah uh
represent

02:28:03.269 --> 02:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
elme how much of that money was spent on
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
Spectrum which seems to be extremely
 
02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
industry yeah the vast majority of it
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
was spent on Spectrum their report and
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
then the report regarding problem gaming
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
that came was mostly generated by the
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
you okay is there anyone else who would
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
like to testify
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
328 seeing none I'll close the public
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
328 okay now uh
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
as you noticed by looking at the
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
schedule our next public hearing is at
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
1:00 leaving us about half an hour
 
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
however the good news is uh that will
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
should go fairly quickly because it's
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
been withdrawn by the sponsor but since
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's the clerk been communicating with
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk since it's been noticed um I
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
still have to open the public hearing
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
and see if anyone's here to testify but
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
I will be telling anyone who's here to
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
testify that it's being withdrawn and we
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
won't be considering it so I'm imagining
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to go fast so while it's
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1:00 I would say Let's
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh let's be back
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
by 115 sharp so that we can I don't want
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
to just in case it takes a little bit
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
longer I don't want to be cutting into
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
the next one so so uh we'll come back
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
from lunch at 1:5 then we have two bills
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I have
 
02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
have yeah we'll keep you on
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:48.910 align:start position:0%

03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
to ex try to exec those three bills when
 
03:29:40.990 --> 03:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're done with the um the agency
 
03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
presentations and I think that's going
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
to be at about three I don't think it's
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
going to take too much longer than about
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
half half an hour 45 minutes to do those
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
three so those will be coming out in an
 
03:29:52.590 --> 03:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
additional uh email from
 
03:29:52.600 --> 03:29:54.510 align:start position:0%
additional uh email from
Karen

Karen
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay yes business question so because of
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
the timing those will be on the calendar
 
03:30:02.229 --> 03:30:02.239 align:start position:0%

shamberg thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
members of the House Ways and Means
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
Committee I am uh New Hampshire State
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
Rep Tom shamberg representing marac 6
 
03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
the towns of Wilman and
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
Sutton for the last six years I and
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
others in this legislature have tried to
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
address the adequate student aid funding
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
issue for public education to our
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
communities and its effect upon the
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
local education tax rate trying to
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
attack this problem using our past and
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
even present Financial technique
 
03:34:28.229 --> 03:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
approaches has been
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
frustrating thus in March of 2024 I
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
contacted the LBA and the Dr for input
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
on my outof thee boox approaches to
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
provide enough Revenue to overcome
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
increased adequate Aid to meet judge
 
03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
ruoff suggested 7,000 356 Aid figure per
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
student and also to remove the swep tax
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
from local taxpayer
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
bills this bill before you today House
 
03:34:57.319 --> 03:34:58.189 align:start position:0%
bills this bill before you today House
Bill

03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:35:02.110 --> 03:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
255 and the next bill on the agenda at 2
 
03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
p.m. House Bill 318 are two of the four
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
bills that I had drafted
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully to become part of the solution
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
that addresses the Claremont decisions
 
03:35:17.590 --> 03:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
and the current legal
 
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
situations and as you see the estimated
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
change in percentage of Revenue that
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be deposited in the education
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund from the business profit tax
 
03:35:28.510 --> 03:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
43.9% increase bringing in an estimated
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
addition of $18 plus million to the
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
education trust fund but a decrease in
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state's operating fund the
 
03:35:44.469 --> 03:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of this bill and the
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
next one is of local education property
 
03:35:52.990 --> 03:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
tax relief for all real estate taxpayers
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
from family homes small business owners
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the largest companies in the
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
state and with the conclusion of that Mr
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll take any
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
Spears well I guess that's going to end
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
do I have any questions for
 
03:36:18.239 --> 03:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
do I have any questions for
representative

03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
shamberg Aly you look like you might
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah how are you going
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.830 --> 03:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
government first of all I think we
 
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
should at least be champions of property
 
03:36:41.640 --> 03:36:43.150 align:start position:0%
should at least be champions of property
tax

03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:36:47.309 --> 03:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
relief and when when it comes to
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the approach to operating the rest of
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
the operating
 
03:36:55.469 --> 03:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
budget I think we're going to have to
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative Aly
 
03:36:58.120 --> 03:36:59.950 align:start position:0%
representative Aly
reconstruct

03:36:59.950 --> 03:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
reconstruct
 
03:37:03.309 --> 03:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
our approach to our social
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
policies and
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
to some of
 
03:37:12.630 --> 03:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
um designated programs that we have have
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
out there um it's going to take some
 
03:37:23.830 --> 03:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
hard work it's going to take as was said
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
many years ago that there'll be people
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
that will roll up their sleeves and try
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
to fix the problem
 
03:37:33.150 --> 03:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
or there'll be those that will do
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes uh maybe to shift the
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
blame somewhere else I'm hoping that
 
03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
blame somewhere else I'm hoping that
doesn't

03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
occur we have to sit down I I as I said
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
I presented four bills were drafted
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're seeing in the first
 
03:37:52.269 --> 03:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
two the first two this for 158 plus the
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
second one would generated about 68 plus
 
03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
second one would generated about 68 plus
that's

03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:37:58.269 --> 03:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
226 that could be put in the education
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund and let the legislature
 
03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
decide what they'd like to do with that
 
03:38:01.640 --> 03:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
decide what they'd like to do with that
additional

03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:38:06.229 --> 03:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
money uh I don't have any suggestions
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
coming represent
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
opal just for my knowledge since I'm a
 
03:38:21.030 --> 03:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
first year member here what was the um
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
what was the revenue from the interest
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
year you Rec call I don't recall is it
 
03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
there's a representative Ellenberger
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
might have the
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
answer oh go ahead it was an excess of
 
03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
answer oh go ahead it was an excess of
180

03:38:42.790 --> 03:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
180
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you Mr chair why did you
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
choose that percentage and not some
 
03:38:59.469 --> 03:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
blend it was a simple just switch first
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
of all when I went to the LBA and asked
 
03:39:07.229 --> 03:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
how much would it
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
take to address the increase in student
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
aid which is over 500 million and how
 
03:39:18.750 --> 03:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
much more would it take to
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
address the swept tax and this was the
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
simplest process
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
move just the percentages around it
 
03:39:30.670 --> 03:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
leaves the option open for the this
 
03:39:33.630 --> 03:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee and for the legislature to
 
03:39:36.110 --> 03:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
maybe change the percentages if they
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
would wish I was just trying to generate
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
some outof the Box thinking on how
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
to put money into the education trust
 
03:39:44.359 --> 03:39:48.670 align:start position:0%
to put money into the education trust
fund

03:39:48.670 --> 03:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
shamber for uh entertaining me for a
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
minute and let me ask you this question
 
03:40:03.630 --> 03:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah I don't think there's uh you
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
know we we want to fund this my my
 
03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:07.349 align:start position:0%
know we we want to fund this my my
concern

03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
is there seems to be from what we heard
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
last week I think it was Drew Klein
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
testified Josiah Bartlett and uh some of
 
03:40:18.189 --> 03:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
the stuff I read in this uh New
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute I mean
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
the revenue goes up in the school
 
03:40:24.910 --> 03:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
spending you know the spending and the
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
spending you know so there's there's no
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
end in the cycle so if you if you have
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
the solution which you know I know
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
you're trying to think outside the box
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
and we got a little time could you go
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
back to the beginning like in the 1990s
 
03:40:42.189 --> 03:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
and walk us through this and explain how
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
how we come out on the right end of this
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
that was a bit of a joke I just wanted
 
03:40:50.590 --> 03:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
to see how you would
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
respond I figured we have a half hour to
 
03:40:55.950 --> 03:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
kill so no but I do appreciate I do
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question but
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe
 
03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
that this committee here with the next
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
other two bills that'll be coming in in
 
03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:07.950 align:start position:0%
other two bills that'll be coming in in
the

03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
future can at least address property tax
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
relief by putting more money in the
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
and it will allow people in their own
 
03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
residents in their own Community like
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
yours to decide how much they want to
 
03:41:32.149 --> 03:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
put into their local property tax for
 
03:41:32.159 --> 03:41:33.830 align:start position:0%
put into their local property tax for
education

03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
and if we're giving enough adequate Aid
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
and we get rid of the swept property tax
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
portion then I could maybe
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Klein but his was all mostly Theory
 
03:41:53.710 --> 03:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
not data and I'm trying to present data
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
numbers that we can look at to
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
develop a a budget that will cover
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
our education public
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
education and reduce our property taxes
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to have to make
 
03:42:12.349 --> 03:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
programs thank you are you looking to
 
03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
programs thank you are you looking to
increase

03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
a different tax or you're just saying we
 
03:42:20.670 --> 03:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
should make cuts to balance it off I
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
502 which will present another source
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
another bucket of money that would come
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the education trust fund and the and
 
03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
the business profits
 
03:42:48.030 --> 03:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
tax and another bill that has some
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
suggestions 503 I think which one's 502
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
is that complete corporate reporting
 
03:42:58.870 --> 03:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
relative to yes and number 503 is some
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
changes in four of the bills four of the
 
03:43:07.590 --> 03:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
revenue sources that I asked the LBA and
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Dr how much they would generate
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
by a
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative duet okay I I got a fish
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
hook in my lip thank you for taking my
 
03:43:24.920 --> 03:43:27.469 align:start position:0%
hook in my lip thank you for taking my
question

03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:29.469 --> 03:43:29.479 align:start position:0%
um gonna
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
have take from pet to pay Paul scenario
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
here $158 million and you've referenced
 
03:43:39.710 --> 03:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
social programs a couple times can you
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
more definitively
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
explain what you mean by that
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think we address various issues here
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the state that are uh for the
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
citizens of the State uh there's
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
programs that are out there
 
03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
that um some people say why do we have
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
to pay this much or why should the state
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
be giving this much it'll be some policy
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
changes to reduce the the amount coming
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
from the state and maybe be picked up
 
03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
more by maybe a lot of our nonprofits
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
which I understand do a great job uh
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they will have to increase a
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more uh to take on some of
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
them I don't know if that answered your
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.030 --> 03:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
mle representative elberger thank you Mr
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not sure if this question
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
is properly directed to representative
 
03:44:46.349 --> 03:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
shamberger somebody else on the
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
committee actually it's a couple of
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions the State education trust fund
 
03:44:55.349 --> 03:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
is set at a minimum of 363 million is
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
that correct when was that
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
number um
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
determined represent
 
03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:08.189 align:start position:0%
determined represent
Aly

03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
2011 um so in 2011 a number of 363
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
million was determined
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
minimum and just an act actual amount so
 
03:45:23.229 --> 03:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
it can't be higher inflation has
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
occurred it's down
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
about that that was my next question
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
that that in the years from 2011 now to
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
2025 despite the impact of inflation
 
03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
that number has remained the
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
same thank
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
you representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
chair so one of the problems that I've
 
03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
run into is that if you want to call
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
both sides on the issue nobody wants to
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know there's nobody wants a give and
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
take and uh I've tried to meet with the
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
school board president where I live
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
several times and she she won't meet
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
with me you know she'll say well give me
 
03:46:08.830 --> 03:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
some days and give me some times and I
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
do and then we never meet and I I think
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
the answer is like the schools if you
 
03:46:17.870 --> 03:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
look look at them there part of the
 
03:46:21.389 --> 03:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
school has has to be you know they're
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
educating students but it's also a
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
business in a sense and you just can't
 
03:46:30.429 --> 03:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
keep throwing money into a business if
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
you're not getting an end result that's
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
a better I mean the
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
school uh results that I'm reading for
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
the most part are going down the number
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
of students are going down but I keep
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
hearing that all the costs are fixed so
 
03:46:50.590 --> 03:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
all the costs can't be fixed but I think
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
there has to be Creative Solutions
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
number of children in the
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
classroom uh I hear you know New
 
03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 100 plus superintendent we
 
03:47:02.670 --> 03:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
have one in the Chai Chester I mean you
 
03:47:04.510 --> 03:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
can just about put all the kids in Chai
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
Chester in this room I don't know why we
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
need a superintendent my point is do you
 
03:47:11.710 --> 03:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
agree that we need to look at some of
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
the spending in the schools and maybe
 
03:47:16.510 --> 03:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
find a way to reduce the spending in
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
order to help balance and work this
 
03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
order to help balance and work this
thing

03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:47:22.510 --> 03:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
through representative ORS I believe
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
that what I am presenting is property
 
03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
that what I am presenting is property
tax

03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
relief options for both Republicans and
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats what you're having a problem
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
with I think is a local problem of
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
handling the issue within your
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
community the community of uh the curge
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
Regional School District did say that
 
03:47:51.389 --> 03:47:51.399 align:start position:0%
what was being presented to them when
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
those 16600 people showed up on
 
03:47:54.479 --> 03:47:55.710 align:start position:0%
those 16600 people showed up on
deliberation

03:47:55.710 --> 03:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
deliberation
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
day we will pay what is necessary now
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
there were only 10 some 31 I think that
 
03:48:05.149 --> 03:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
were not in favor of that approach that
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
we will pay so I think it's a local on
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
the spending part it's not something
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
maybe the state the state should at
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
least address the clont one and cl on
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
two decisions and any decision that
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
comes out of conval regarding Aid and
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other one that regards the
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the um swept tax uh
 
03:48:30.189 --> 03:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
when I was
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
campaigning seven out of 10 I'd knock on
 
03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:33.790 align:start position:0%
campaigning seven out of 10 I'd knock on
the

03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
door and I'd ask their opinion what is
 
03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:37.750 align:start position:0%
door and I'd ask their opinion what is
the

03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
most important thing that you think we
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
could do or what bothers you the most
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
and it's their property tax MH they're
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
property tax they didn't say their Town
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
property they eventually got around to
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
saying the school property tax and if
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
you haven't heard that I saw a senator
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh somebody on the other side of the
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
wall that
 
03:49:02.670 --> 03:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
said the most important thing I ever
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
heard was housing well fine maybe he
 
03:49:08.429 --> 03:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't in a area that that's all they
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
were worried about but people are living
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
in these homes and some of them are
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to start losing their homes unless
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
this property tax relief comes forth
 
03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:19.550 align:start position:0%
this property tax relief comes forth
from

03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
legislature yes representative
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
chy thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your presentation
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
are you saying to alleviate the swep tax
 
03:49:41.550 --> 03:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
or to eliminate the swep
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
tax I'm saying that if the four bills
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
that could be part of this solution it
 
03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the swept tax because
 
03:49:51.870 --> 03:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
the state would then be able to
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
adjust its real spending issue it
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't it it hasn't it's not spending
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
the 363 million it is still coming out
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the local property taxpayers pocket
 
03:50:08.149 --> 03:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a transfer electronically oh we
 
03:50:09.870 --> 03:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
got it we'll send it back to them they
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
don't actually collect it I say
 
03:50:17.469 --> 03:50:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
for representa Aly thank you thank you
 
03:50:26.349 --> 03:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh the issue I have with this is that
 
03:50:26.359 --> 03:50:28.189 align:start position:0%
uh the issue I have with this is that
for

03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
years uh the state has been cutting down
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
the taxes in the general
 
03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:37.070 align:start position:0%
the taxes in the general
fund

03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:50:38.910 --> 03:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
and in
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
response they had to cut down Services
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
some of these social Services you're
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
talking about uh and then the towns were
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
faced with do we use our local property
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
tax increase our local property tax to
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
restore these services that we've always
 
03:51:05.070 --> 03:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
had or the time that the pension fund
 
03:51:05.080 --> 03:51:07.149 align:start position:0%
had or the time that the pension fund
was

03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
on uh that they they took away the local
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
share of the pension fund and the local
 
03:51:20.429 --> 03:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
groups had to restore the money that the
 
03:51:23.910 --> 03:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
state had not had to pay anymore the
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
local groups had to pay it
 
03:51:31.309 --> 03:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
so isn't doesn't this just move the
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
money around in another way to the same
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion for the property
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
tax I believe representative Al me
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
where some of the structural changes
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to make in our operating
 
03:51:47.710 --> 03:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
budget are going to have to come
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
from when local community members as you
 
03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
know have more money in their pocket
 
03:51:54.910 --> 03:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
they're not put the property tax uh
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
taxes they will make more decisions on
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
what is important in their Community
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
they'll say what it's properly presented
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
by the either the school board or a
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit comes in we would like to
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
see this program go through the town
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
people will make some decisions
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
how much they want to put into it but I
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
do believe that the state has an
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund those benefits
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
for police fire
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
emergency uh I believe the state has
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
because those individuals those people
 
03:52:36.189 --> 03:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
are serving serve the entire State they
 
03:52:38.830 --> 03:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
can go from one Community to another to
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
help out I think the state should be be
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
funding that basic principle
 
03:52:48.389 --> 03:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
not not not all the local communi should
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
no follow
 
03:52:58.950 --> 03:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
up all right uh representative Murphy
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um do you think that
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
the newly created Committee of
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
government efficiency may be helpful in
 
03:53:06.870 --> 03:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
identifying areas for Savings in the
 
03:53:06.880 --> 03:53:09.469 align:start position:0%
identifying areas for Savings in the
general

03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
fund if they would put representative
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative M I think that we
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
I I don't there is waste there's waste
 
03:53:32.429 --> 03:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
we waste time in here at times we don't
 
03:53:34.269 --> 03:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
get started right at 10: because we're
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
still coming through the door uh we we
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
we don't get actual questions we get
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
statements all we do waste time and so
 
03:53:47.950 --> 03:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
there is waste it's just I think some
 
03:53:50.070 --> 03:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
people are going to be
 
03:53:53.790 --> 03:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
targeted by this
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
new what is it called a committee
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
a I realize it's called Cod but it's
 
03:53:59.920 --> 03:54:02.110 align:start position:0%
a I realize it's called Cod but it's
just

03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
what it might come up with some great
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
ideas we can all work together that's
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
work yes represent
 
03:54:19.469 --> 03:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
op thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
you representative shamberg for bringing
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
this because I I I do think it's
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
important to have this
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
conversation wherever it leads but but
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
at least having this conversation to
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
examine I'd like to follow
 
03:54:33.309 --> 03:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
up um with a predicate and then a
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
question following up on something
 
03:54:40.389 --> 03:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative or said um and I do think
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to think about public
 
03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:44.910 align:start position:0%
that we need to think about public
education

03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh and our schools um in economic terms
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
as well as you know the the general
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
issue of educating our children but what
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is creating a
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce that will be attractive to
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
businesses to keep those businesses here
 
03:55:05.790 --> 03:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
to enable those businesses to continue
 
03:55:11.070 --> 03:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
to work to continue to innovate um and I
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
know in my personal case if
 
03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee will forgive me this this
 
03:55:20.030 --> 03:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
personal detour when my wife and I first
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
moved to the town of Canaan in
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
200000 um my wife was pregnant with our
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
first child and we were working with a
 
03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
realtor in a community that wasn't
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
Canaan um and we found a house that we
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
loved in Canaan and wanted to take a
 
03:55:39.189 --> 03:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
look at it and the realtor very
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
specifically said you don't want to go
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
there the schools aren't
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
good um
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's story after Story of families
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
making decisions about where they might
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
want to move based on the educational
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
quality in that
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
District now Hampshire I believe is now
 
03:56:00.510 --> 03:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
the second has the second oldest
 
03:56:04.189 --> 03:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
population in the nation we're getting
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
older um if we want to continue to have
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
an educated and well-trained
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce in that it was it 25 to 50 for
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot don't you think we need to
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
focus on education not just for the
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
moral and and other social values of
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
education but also as an economic driver
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
potentially or the
 
03:56:32.120 --> 03:56:33.670 align:start position:0%
potentially or the
reverse

03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
reverse
 
03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative I believe we should the
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
state should address it as an economic
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
driver and uh the US Chamber of Commerce
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
reinforced the role of the education
 
03:56:48.070 --> 03:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
system by saying our educational system
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
is the Cornerstone of an educated
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
skilled Workforce and our students of
 
03:56:55.469 --> 03:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
today are tomorrow's Workforce and the
 
03:56:58.830 --> 03:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
Bia also has stressed they want an
 
03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:00.830 align:start position:0%
Bia also has stressed they want an
educated

03:57:00.830 --> 03:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
educated
 
03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce and they've stressed that
 
03:57:07.790 --> 03:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
since I saw their last paper was
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
2011 in
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
2018 it was also part of their policy to
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
have an educated Workforce they want
 
03:57:18.510 --> 03:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
someone to
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
fund education so that we have an
 
03:57:24.990 --> 03:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
educated Workforce and we as a state
 
03:57:27.750 --> 03:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
should be doing
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
that uh any other questions Mr
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%

start with our last public session of
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
today and that would be HB 318 we'll
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
open the public session on HB
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
318 and uh we will invite representative
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
Shamburg back up to
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.229 --> 04:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman what I'll do
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
is I'll just read the the
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
title uh representative Tom shamberg
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
I'll spill 318 and act relative to the
 
04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of revenue from business
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
Enterprise deposited in the education
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the bill increases the
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of revenue from the business
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax deposit and education
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund which will equal 30
 
04:02:49.590 --> 04:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
43.9% on the numbers that we've had in
 
04:02:49.600 --> 04:02:50.550 align:start position:0%
43.9% on the numbers that we've had in
the

04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
past wherever the drra came up with the
 
04:02:58.110 --> 04:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
am um and the two bills together would
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
generate an estimated $226 million
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
140 million short of reduc or removing
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
the swep eliminating it all together but
 
04:03:11.790 --> 04:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
as I said there are two more bills to
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
come forth in this pack pack that I put
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
together hopefully uh you will think
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
about that because it has an estimated
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money that might that probably
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
would cover this and cover some other
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
things also
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
so hopefully you had all the questions
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
one I guess my question would be
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative shamber that you know
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's I see what you're trying to do
 
04:03:43.469 --> 04:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
it's admirable to try to fund this to
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
the extent uh needs to be funded and to
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the the Statewide property tax
 
04:03:50.110 --> 04:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
but the money's got to come from
 
04:03:52.990 --> 04:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere so all this now the the the
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
new shortfall in the general fund um is
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to be funded from Sumer
 
04:04:00.550 --> 04:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
where do you anticipate that coming
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
from if I may respond Mr chairman since
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the the
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
shortfall uh this committee did not
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
cause that shortfall this committee last
 
04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
year did not cause that shortfall
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
they did their due diligence in looking
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
at all the figures taking the historical
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
context and emphasized by you Mr
 
04:04:29.389 --> 04:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
chairman emphasized by representative
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
ranking member Aly
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
money out there to take care of
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
all this the the these situations and we
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
are putting in
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
programs that are causing some of
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
this deficit that we're seeing now that
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're having to eliminate positions or
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
not spend
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
anymore uh but it wasn't caused by this
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee and their approach to how we
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
should fund I'm not going to say where
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
that where that decision was made I
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
think the governor's office May be able
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
to help us this time since we have a a
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
governor that U went through the public
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
education process and understands the
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
value of education and maybe we would
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
like to see a solution be
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
made uh Thinking Out of the Box because
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get it the other way
 
04:05:37.229 --> 04:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
when when a decision was was made we
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll approach it with a a swept
 
04:05:46.279 --> 04:05:47.630 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll approach it with a a swept
tax

04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
and take 800 million out of the
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
operating budget and it's been 40 years
 
04:05:56.349 --> 04:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
almost or 20
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
27 years 99
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
99 still
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
fighting this
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
approach this committee could become the
 
04:06:11.309 --> 04:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
champion of property tax relief at least
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
getting it out there and let the people
 
04:06:15.040 --> 04:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
getting it out there and let the people
respond

04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
respond
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
to the legislature on whatever this
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee comes up
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
with so but the issue would be that now
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
taxes have to come from somewhere or
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
programs have to be cut I mean do you
 
04:06:33.630 --> 04:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
what is your perception of it
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
that or you're just saying three of
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
these bills that I have put
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
together do
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
increase the present taxes that are out
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
there they do not now there is one bill
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to come in that you should
 
04:06:56.670 --> 04:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
find very
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
interesting but it designates there's
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
certain things that designates I did go
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's when I saw the LBA I did ask him
 
04:07:07.070 --> 04:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
how do I
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
$8,000 you student that's the next
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's the next bill yeah are you are
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
you referring to the bill that increases
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
dividends that bill number 503 I think
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay well that answers then that answers
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
my question yeah it's there all right
 
04:07:35.790 --> 04:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
shart if you
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
recall there was a serious property taxx
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
issue in
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Connecticut promised to
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
get rid of the property
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
tax if
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
only an income tax was put
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
forward and the result was that it
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
passed and Connecticut got an income
 
04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
tax and
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
then it got a sales tax and then the
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
and now it's higher than it is just
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
about anywhere except New Hampshire the
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to get at I thought you
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
were going to ask a question but go
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
on well give me a chance give me a
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
chance we already talked earlier about
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:39.630 --> 04:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
philosophical the question
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
is under the structure of New Hampshire
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
where the towns are in have the ability
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to impose a property tax for what the
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
town wants to do how would it decreasing
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
the small section such as
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
swept of that property tax which is
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
minuscule have anything any bearing
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on the property tax that as
 
04:09:07.389 --> 04:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
uh was mentioned in one of the Articles
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh published recently uh less
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
than 11% of the people in town vote
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
for how would a state action have
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
anything to do with what the towns do
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
and the lack of participation of towns
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
in their own
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
government well first of
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
all the people in the
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
towns did not vote for a swept tax that
 
04:09:38.349 --> 04:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
was done by the legislature and if you
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
use the position of well we were elected
 
04:09:44.349 --> 04:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
by them so we'll put it on they no
 
04:09:44.359 --> 04:09:45.229 align:start position:0%
by them so we'll put it on they no
that's

04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
wilmet by the actions of the state have
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
to draw 400 and some thousand other
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
dollars out of their pocket that they
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
didn't get a chance to vote on swep tax
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is the amount that they have to
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
come up with that doesn't include the
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
local property tax which they can vote
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
on it doesn't
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
include the
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
county they send the bill we don't get a
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
that local operations operating budget
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
is decided by the people they control
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
the money they have been unable to get a
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
voice what they want to do at the swep
 
04:10:30.269 --> 04:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
tax that's why we have the lawsuits I
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
and going back to your income tax and
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
your sales tax that is not even what I
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
suggested no no I was and that's why I
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
say it should be a question versus some
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the statements I don't mean to be
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
contemptuous I just oh yes
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
I I just think that it's important that
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
keep an open mind and let's look at some
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
solutions and work together on
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
this okay questions representative
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
elme thank you this is not directly a
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
question about uh what you brought
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
forward but it is something that on Mr
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
marand is talking about lately which is
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
that our problem is that we pay a
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.790 --> 04:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
pupil and we have a lot less pupils than
 
04:11:30.189 --> 04:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
we used to but we still got our school
 
04:11:32.590 --> 04:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
buildings and we still got
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
superintendents in one small spot and
 
04:11:38.910 --> 04:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other bureaucracy that we
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature have told them they have
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
and have to pay
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
for so
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
on his essay on that
 
04:11:58.189 --> 04:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
was about
 
04:12:01.510 --> 04:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we start to think about
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
what Vermont has been trying to do which
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked terribly well but to
 
04:12:06.760 --> 04:12:09.109 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked terribly well but to
consolidate

04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
schools and in the North country that's
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
practically impossible
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
we talked about that back in
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
1999 in the committee That was supposed
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
to be doing school
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
funding uh and you were going to put a
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
kid on a bus and have him on the bus for
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
three hours every day at
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
least and in other places we tried we
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
closed two elementary schools since I've
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
been in Lebanon the Uproar was
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
incredible but if you don't consolidate
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
in some ways aren't we just on a losing
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
track representa B
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
me where we start a fertility climing
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
well I used to
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
teach you may think this is funny all
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
right but in the town that I lived in
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
Ohio I was also the mayor but I taught
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
school and things like that
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
and we had in one
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
stretch one decade
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
a dramatic increase in the number of
 
04:13:19.870 --> 04:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancies number of kids and we
 
04:13:21.550 --> 04:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
finally found out what it was when we
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
went to clean the water tower we had
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
pigeons that were getting inside and
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
whatever they were dropping I think is
 
04:13:29.159 --> 04:13:30.189 align:start position:0%
whatever they were dropping I think is
caused

04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
caused
 
04:13:34.349 --> 04:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
that explosion so
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh I can't
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
answer I thank you Mr chairman I don't
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
if there's any more questions we were
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
taking you seriously at first well I'm
 
04:13:47.860 --> 04:13:47.870 align:start position:0%
glad because the
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:55.830 align:start position:0%
glad because the
[Laughter]

04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
people um any other questions yes can I
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
just make a comment sure oh this is true
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
I was on the school board in Lexington
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and toward the end of the
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
school year we'd had budget passed and
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
sometime during the summer and there
 
04:14:14.910 --> 04:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
were six Elementary schools in one
 
04:14:17.710 --> 04:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
Elementary School
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
District three families with
 
04:14:24.990 --> 04:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
triplets and two families with twins all
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
of kindergarten age moved into that one
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
District we had to get another teacher I
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
mean that wasn't so weird things can
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
happen but they're not happening here
 
04:14:36.640 --> 04:14:37.349 align:start position:0%
happen but they're not happening here
right

04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
now and you know I don't know for
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
example how the good people of
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
Chichester might feel about
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
consolidating with another District
 
04:14:48.269 --> 04:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
nearby even if whether the legalities
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
were there or not and giving up control
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
over your schools but that may be one of
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
the things that we do need to look
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
at those were not children from Orwell
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
Ohio I guarantee that all right they
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
didn't go
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
there okay um I'll get to questions in a
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
second here but let's I think some of
 
04:15:12.109 --> 04:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing now is maybe a a
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
work session type stuff I think we're
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
we've gone off the the ran for public uh
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
hearing uh representative
 
04:15:23.790 --> 04:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
ORS yes so to pick up the conversation a
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean Chai Chester I think
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
it'd be a real battle that's what I
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to do pick up the
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
conversation but no but I mean I guess
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
the question I'd ask you is do you think
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's the possibility that some of us
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
could get together and sit down I mean
 
04:15:39.760 --> 04:15:41.030 align:start position:0%
could get together and sit down I mean
most

04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
most
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
businesses have to look in word first
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
when things are going wrong right so
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of the gold in the
 
04:15:47.359 --> 04:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of the gold in the
mind

04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
concept no okay so basically the gold in
 
04:15:55.870 --> 04:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
the mind concept is if you need to cut
 
04:15:55.880 --> 04:15:57.109 align:start position:0%
the mind concept is if you need to cut
your

04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
expenses this isn't a water tower
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
joke you know you have to look at what
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing right so when I work uh
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
with dold in a tank manufacturer uh a
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
facility you all heard of them BAE
 
04:16:13.630 --> 04:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
Systems what they were doing is is uh
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
they were they're having problems in the
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
Manu in the in the manufacturing process
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it came as a result of
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
improper drill sharpening so they're
 
04:16:27.070 --> 04:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
drilling holes with improperly sharpened
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
drill bits and it's and it was causing a
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
lot of product waste because the holes
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
were either slightly elongated or
 
04:16:36.269 --> 04:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be they didn't meet
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
spec so the the whole thought is to look
 
04:16:41.229 --> 04:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
Inward and start looking at where you
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
can save I and I know in chiester we
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
have some pretty small
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
classrooms we have two adults I think in
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
every classroom and you know so there's
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
there's money we could
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
save thank you and and that's responding
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
to his well let me just let me just um
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
educate the committee I mean something
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
like that or some of the other things
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
that have been said are would you
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
believe questions because um but okay
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
answer that and to answer that we should
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
look our St legislature should look at
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
what it has made education do by
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates 118 of them that this
 
04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
state has
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
required where are we going to find that
 
04:17:27.359 --> 04:17:28.149 align:start position:0%
required where are we going to find that
we

04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
can't go out and raise our prices on
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
things like businesses can so thank you
 
04:17:34.640 --> 04:17:35.630 align:start position:0%

that is um attached to the bill and we
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%

04:19:42.910 --> 04:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of leeway so and any
