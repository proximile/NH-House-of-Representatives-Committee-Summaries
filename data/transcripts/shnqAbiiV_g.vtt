um representative teresian the house
 
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
staff has prepared a
 
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
side by side of the differences between
 
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
the bill so maybe it makes sense for us
 
00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
to just go
 
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
over and for the public to know what the
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
differences are with your commission
 
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
the house version of 291 made a change
 
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.069 align:start position:0%
the house version of 291 made a change
to

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
657.15 in regards to absentee ballot

657.15 in regards to absentee ballot
procedures

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
by modifying language at the
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
end we're providing the list
 
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the first 60 to have a time period
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
within it
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
that provision was removed by the senate
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
and then the house had a separate
 
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
provision in regards to the secretary of
 
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
provision in regards to the secretary of
state

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
looking at absentee ballot request
 
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
looking at absentee ballot request
information

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
to create a particular report
 
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
the senate i think
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
at least our analysis shows modified it
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
did it modified the language and it
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
moved it to a different position it
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
moved it to a different
 
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
place in 657 657 24a
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
and the procedure itself actually the
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
report what it was supposed to look at
 
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
was changed along with the fact the
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
senate changed
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
the i would say analysis task from the
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to the ag's office
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i do know
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor of 291
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
has joined the meeting and to pursuant
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
to house rules that
 
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
that person can address the committee of
 
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
conference if they so desire
 
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
so i don't know whether representative
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
thinking a possible solution for this
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
may not be an either
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
it may be an ant it would seem to me a
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
logical solution
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
is for the house version to take
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
the first step with secretary of state
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing the information
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
under rsa 657-15
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
because of the sentence in in that
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
statute that says
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
said clerk shall keep the lists of the
 
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
names and addresses arranged
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
by voting places of all applicants to
 
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
by voting places of all applicants to
whom

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
whom
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
the official absentee ballots have been
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
sent and shall identify
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
the official absentee ballots which have
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
been returned to the clark
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
and shall second uh record the absentee
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
voter applications
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
information in the statewide centralized
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
voter registration database
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
the issue is if the secretary of state
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
could do that analysis under
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
the sending of absentee ballot statute
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
if there is any issues with it
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's where the senate version
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill under rsa 657
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
24 which is the misuse of absentee
 
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.230 align:start position:0%
24 which is the misuse of absentee
ballot

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
section that seems to make the most
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
um until
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
there is evidence of misuse
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why we would
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
have that attorney general
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
review of the of the ballots and that's
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
why i thought
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to almost merge both
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
so that the secretary of state would do
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
the initial analysis using the statewide
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
centralized voter
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
registration database and then if
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
the head of the election law in the
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
house and the head of the election law
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the senate see that there is
 
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.029 align:start position:0%
and the senate see that there is
evidence

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
or reason to question the
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
misuse of the absentee ballot that's
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
when the senate version would kick
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
in that if that makes any sense at all
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
i also have quickly two concerns
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
one is whether the attorney general
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
has access to those uh
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
the statewide centralized voter
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
registration database
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
without a court order and
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
i also wondered why the senate
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
removed the protection for
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
those voters that have presented to the
 
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
those voters that have presented to the
supervisors

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh valid protection orders uh under rsa
 
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh valid protection orders uh under rsa
173b

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
173b
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that if the attorney
 
00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that if the attorney
general

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
does the analysis and it is subject to
 
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
does the analysis and it is subject to
91a

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
that that information would then become
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
non-protected for those those victims of
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
abuse or why whatever reason that
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
they're on that list
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
so those were those were my concerns but
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
i don't think that they
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
replace each other i think they would
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much right
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
certainly the vision when i rewrote
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
your bill and you know you and i talked
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of different times
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
about it is that
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state would cause a
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
report to be
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
generated out of the centralized
 
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.589 align:start position:0%
generated out of the centralized
database

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
which contained the information needed
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
for the attorney general's
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
investigator to do just what
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
the representative uh was asking for
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago three years ago i forget
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that it would have more meaning
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the data was reviewed by
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
a third-party non-partisan party
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
and found to be good or found to be
 
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.869 align:start position:0%
and found to be good or found to be
lacking

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
lacking
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
the access to the names the access to
 
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.150 align:start position:0%
the access to the names the access to
the

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
agents the access to other information
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
that is in there that could be provided
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
in that report
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
looking into election laws um
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be available to them as i
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere whether it was
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
the senate floor or whatever if we did
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
get a list of people
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
where 10 ballots were sent and they were
 
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.189 align:start position:0%
where 10 ballots were sent and they were
all

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
you know 19 20 21 year old and someone
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
said well gee that's a college address
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
i would believe that a lot sooner than
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
if i got
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
ages of 67 45
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
22 you know whatever okay
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
and one would say you know maybe you
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
don't have to look any further at those
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
and the other one would say gee
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
something's going on
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the attorney general uh an
 
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
uh and the attorney general uh an
investigator

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
has other responsibilities for looking
 
00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.949 align:start position:0%
has other responsibilities for looking
at

00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
problems with the election they are the
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
ones that get the results
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
of the cards that go out they are the
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
ones that have other responsibilities
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office would
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to generate the report
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
so that they would be following what is
 
00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
so that they would be following what is
already

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
allowed for them to do in statute is
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's true i don't
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
know where the secretary
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
stays again you know they have
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
broad authority in in elections
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
to to work with people and as it says
 
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
to to work with people and as it says
that

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
the data is going to come out of the
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
centralized database
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
whether you know who writes the report
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
is immaterial to me
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
as long as the person doing the review
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
so uh for myself on the senate side i'm
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with words
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
the way we did it and the reasons for
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i have a
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
real problem with the senate version
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
because and i'm not sure from listening
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
to to representative hill and senator
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
gray as to
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're sort of talking a merger
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then i think we're sort of talking i
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
think what the senate is
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
the ag's office is not a
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
pi agency the ag's office is contacted
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to enforcement of laws when
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
there is reason to believe that laws
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
have not been followed they are not
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
they don't initiate the investigation
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
think something happens so when you talk
 
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.069 align:start position:0%
think something happens so when you talk
about

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
the ag's office gets the parts well the
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
has already done an analysis of the
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
cards that went out to the absentee
 
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.990 align:start position:0%
cards that went out to the absentee
ballot

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
request locations and been returned and
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
then they do the report and the
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state who has
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
the close working relationship with the
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
clerks is the one who contacts them the
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
communities to determine
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah mrs smith was really in so and
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
so when we knew they came back and the
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
daughter has the same name so the
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
sort of through their work takes that
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
off the list
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
so the secretary of state additionally
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state when they put the
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
information together
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be the non-partisan
 
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be the non-partisan
analysis

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to what they think might have
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
happened because the ag's office
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
ultimately becomes the prosecutorial
 
00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:45.670 align:start position:0%
ultimately becomes the prosecutorial
body

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
for the and for the whatever the misuse
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
might have been
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
so what you're doing is you're asking
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor to go out
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
to see if there's been jaywalking and
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
then handing him the complaint
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
to then enforce it and so they sort of
 
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.509 align:start position:0%
to then enforce it and so they sort of
become

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
the witness in their own investigation
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
they do have an investigator whose name
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
i love um
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
but you know i think the initial
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
um work should be done by the secretary
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
of state so
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
when i was listening to representative
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
hill what i was thinking
 
00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:24.949 align:start position:0%
hill what i was thinking
was

00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
section 24 does address more of the
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
misuse that
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
and 1a as 15 is really a report
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
so one option would be to keep one a of
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
the house version
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then add a provision that says
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
should the secretary of state determine
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
there is a probability of misuse of the
 
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.190 align:start position:0%
there is a probability of misuse of the
absentee

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
ballot requests then that information
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
information will be referred to the
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
take the language in regards to the
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
report being generated that the senate
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
had which the house version didn't
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
and add that to the language i mean
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
i think we're all trying to get the same
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
place i just have real concerns about
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
sending it over to the attorney
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
my only comment was that when i wrote
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
this i know that we
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
put in half a half of an investigator
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
a long time ago to work on election
 
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
a long time ago to work on election
issues

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that the way i structured the report
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
um you know if the report is generated
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.710 align:start position:0%
um you know if the report is generated
by

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
in my mind the secretary of state's
 
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
in my mind the secretary of state's
office

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
uh that if that's sorted on how many
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know by address that i can look down
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
with that list
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
in about 35 seconds probably you know
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
and see
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
well you know it doesn't appear to be a
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
problem or
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
or it does you know require further
 
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
or it does you know require further
investigation

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
and that keeping it at the attorney
 
00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.069 align:start position:0%
and that keeping it at the attorney
general's

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
general's
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
office gives me
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
confidence that the information will be
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
thrown out
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
because you know it was shared with
 
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
because you know it was shared with
somebody

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know the proper techniques were used
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know in developing the
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
evidence etc so that a prosecution
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know would not be hampered by
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just suggest that um we
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
could get there
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
if we if we looked at
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
griffin said using out of the house
 
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.150 align:start position:0%
griffin said using out of the house
language

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps merging the two bills for
 
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.550 align:start position:0%
and perhaps merging the two bills for
example

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the house version secretary of state
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately has
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
authority and responsibility look into
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
this as as the
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
original intent of the bill was when it
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
was drafted
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
was to take a look at only a small slice
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
of ft ballots
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
those are requested by mail and then
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
failed to a different location of what
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
the individual's individual uh pressing
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
ballots uh from the address that they
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
had with the checklist installment
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
different address
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't just suggest at that
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
phase that there is any misuse if
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
the house version was retained
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
that could be done and then if there
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
appears to be misuse the amendment the
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
senate did
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
would kick in and investigate that
 
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
would kick in and investigate that
because

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
and the current statue seems to me the
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the authority to look into
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
i i see another aspect that
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
i think is important in this and that is
 
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.430 align:start position:0%
i think is important in this and that is
that

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
the the house version requires
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
a report for absolute ballots that have
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
essentially two um
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
two qualifications being followed at one
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
point and one is they're mailed to an
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
address other than the address that's on
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the other is that more than three or
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
went no x actually more than three so
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
four or more
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
went to the same address and so
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's it's it's addressing that and to
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know that there that is being
 
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
you know that there that is being
checked

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
checked
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i would i would equate this to
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
if we had a uh
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
bank or security investigation team
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the investigation team was if we
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
told them
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
you just watch and listen
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
and as long as you don't hear anything
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
everything's okay
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't bother to go and do an audit go
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
bother to go check anything
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
as long as everything appears to be okay
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
and don't do anything but we don't do
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
ask them to make routine checks routine
 
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:18.150 align:start position:0%
ask them to make routine checks routine
audits

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis and
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
that in a sense is what we're starting
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
here is saying this is an area that has
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the potential it's not saying that
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
there's problems
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
just like a bank examiner when they come
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
in and examine a bank or
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
a security organization they don't they
 
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
a security organization they don't they
don't

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
suggest there is fraud they hope there
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
but they check and so the house version
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
takes this
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
and it says let's take this area where
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
there is potential
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
that this could be abused and it stays
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
with the attorney with the secretary of
 
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
with the attorney with the secretary of
state

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
who is the person in charge of elections
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it stays with the
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
if it proves up again comparing it to
 
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
if it proves up again comparing it to
the

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
securities or bank on it if it proves
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
the audit comes through the bank comes
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
through fine the securities organization
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes through fine
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
nothing ever goes beyond that nothing
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the attorney general
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
it just stays right there and that's why
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
the house version is is good
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it it does that sort of routine
 
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.029 align:start position:0%
because it it does that sort of routine
chat

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
chat
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
just to make sure to give everybody a
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
comfort level
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
that nothing is happening and
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
i i agree on the senate
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
side that any investigation but any
 
00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
side that any investigation but any
investigation

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
so i i actually uh
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
like senator hill's suggestion that it
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
so some modification in the first
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines uh seven
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
through i guess nine ten
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay i don't limit it to one thing
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
or another okay i i added in there that
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
they should also look at
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots at one particular
 
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.070 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots at one particular
community

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
senator gray i actually have a question
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
about that because i'm i did not
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand the sentences written and i'm
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
sure it's me
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
you said the analysis shall include but
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
not be limited to the number of absentee
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
ballots mailed to a common address
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
and significant differences
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question is significant
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
differences from what
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
of the number of ballots that were
 
00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
of the number of ballots that were
requested

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
said your time from what significantly
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
from each other
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
so if you if you go into uh
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
and you have 15 absentee ballot requests
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and everybody in the state is
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
running two or three percent
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
again just to ask the question why
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
so they're not related
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're two different things that are
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
being looked into so two things to say
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
significant differences in the number of
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
ballots requested
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
between cities and towns
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
again you know well but i i gave them
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
and no i i that's why i'm asking because
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
when i read it i really didn't
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
understand so so it is
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
if they have a a much larger percentage
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
in a particular city or town
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
we should at least ask the question more
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
i understand what you asked them to do
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out and then
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
and again that's that's the two things
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
that they have to do with the minimum
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
they can look into other things i mean
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
think about you know senate bill 43
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay and you know how we wish that the
 
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.710 align:start position:0%
okay and you know how we wish that the
law

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
was a little more liberal right now so
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
that they could have done that
 
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
that they could have done that
investigation

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know right off the bat okay and
 
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.390 align:start position:0%
you know right off the bat okay and
again

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to give them a little bit of
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
wiggle room
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
that they've got the data they get it
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
out of the centralized database
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
and they can look into anything they
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
think and
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
not even have to go back to rsa 7
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
is it 7c6 or something
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
where the attorney general is authorized
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
to look into
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
i cannot support anything that i think
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
is leaving a door a jar for
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what the attorney
 
00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:17.270 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what the attorney
general

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
is supposed to investigate because there
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
is difference
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
as to what the term significant
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
difference means
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
and there is difference in regards to
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
what investigation means
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
and you put the attorney general's
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
office in a terrible position
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
when they have to make what is a
 
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
when they have to make what is a
prosecutorial

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether investigators
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
every community in your own police
 
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.549 align:start position:0%
every community in your own police
department

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
gets reports of
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
what people think are fines and the
 
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.710 align:start position:0%
what people think are fines and the
police

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
may or may not follow up on that and
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
in regards to election issues
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about a wide open
 
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.149 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about a wide open
door

00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
they are the recipients of what are
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
thought to be
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
significant differences to your change
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
look again i tried to
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
to rewrite it so that i thought that it
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
would get through the sun
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh it did you know
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
i mean if this bill went away it would
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
not bother me
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay i've got another year before the
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah representative hill and i had
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
conversations before i wrote this
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
and you know i expressed my concerns to
 
00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:43.430 align:start position:0%
and you know i expressed my concerns to
him

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
um and i'm perfectly willing to
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know keep my the rest of my
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
see where they want to go and and you
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
know come back next year and work on
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess mr chair if that's all right
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
what is the senate's
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
issues with the language that
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative hill had
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
without just adding what you've had
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that you don't want the secretary of
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
state's office to be involved in it at
 
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
state's office to be involved in it at
all

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
the question is who does who analyzes
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
and what data they can get okay in the
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
original bill that was brought forward
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
two or three years ago uh representative
 
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.669 align:start position:0%
two or three years ago uh representative
hill

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
hill
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the data first and do the
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the data first and do the
investigation

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay i think that you know that would be
 
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay i think that you know that would be
fine

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh but if i really want to do that
 
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
uh but if i really want to do that
investigation

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
things like the age of the people
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay as i said you know if they're all
 
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.350 align:start position:0%
okay as i said you know if they're all
down

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
in boston on boylston street you know
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
and it's going to one particular address
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
down there
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
and they're all 18 19 20 years old
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
i have a lot less concern than if there
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
address down there with 10 people
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
so there may be just
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
too many things that we have to resolve
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
in this to come through
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a point if they could i
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
a merger of the two pieces it seems like
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
that would satisfy uh
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
some of the more often one of the other
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
problems i didn't point out earlier was
 
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.710 align:start position:0%
problems i didn't point out earlier was
that

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
in the house version private absentee
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
ballot was to be available
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
to public inspections after the election
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
but it also added protections for people
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
that had restraining orders
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh place an apartment in one aid so that
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
that they would an agent would be
 
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
that they would an agent would be
released

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
and the senate removed that section so
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
any investigation done by the attorney
 
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.070 align:start position:0%
any investigation done by the attorney
general's

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
general's
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
office is protected from okay rsa all
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
right so that's good so
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
thanks i will certainly ask the rest of
 
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:08.710 align:start position:0%
thanks i will certainly ask the rest of
like

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
many here you know if they you know
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
want to entertain anything that you guys
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
write and and come back and meet again
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
but i can't i you know well
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
if i may the language there in the house
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
as i look at this as kind of a step one
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
step two process
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
if consent was agreeable to
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
the two pieces if again i won't know
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
the two pieces if again i won't know
whether

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm amenable to it until i see your
 
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
i'm amenable to it until i see your
language

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay you know like having the secretary
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
do the initial you know look through the
 
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.909 align:start position:0%
do the initial you know look through the
data

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with that i don't
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
know if the rest of the
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
my side you know has a problem with that
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want that investigation done
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
by people outside of the secretary of
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
state and attorney general's office
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know for the protection of the data
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
and protections
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh to try to rewrite something
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know what our schedules are i've
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
already got something that's already
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
going into thursday
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
what what we're suggesting is that
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
we use the language that's here it
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict with your senate
 
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.549 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict with your senate
language

00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
and that we use the language uh on
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
on one a use that exact language
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't reflect the static
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
language and
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
um again in in
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
the intent i understand it and i agree
 
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.230 align:start position:0%
the intent i understand it and i agree
with

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
is allowing
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
as they say you know the sunlight is
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's disinfectant and it goes it's 60
 
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:16.950 align:start position:0%
that's disinfectant and it goes it's 60
days

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
after election day uh but when you get
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
into some of the things in 1a
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's where i want
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
the investigator whoever isn't doing the
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
investigation to have a little more
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
freedom of hands and that's one of the
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
things representative griffin
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to support okay so i can't
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
if you're going to give me something you
 
00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:43.590 align:start position:0%
if you're going to give me something you
know

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
take it based on this conversation write
 
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.909 align:start position:0%
take it based on this conversation write
it

00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
send it to us and reschedule me
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
if i admit if i may um again i
 
00:28:55.039 --> 00:29:05.590 align:start position:0%
if i admit if i may um again i
believe

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
but again looking at it as a phase one
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
of doing that
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
again there's been no misuse
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office looks at
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
it there's some things that are
 
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
it there's some things that are
problematic

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.030 align:start position:0%
now the language you put in place
 
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.190 align:start position:0%
now the language you put in place
[Music]

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
regarding what the attorney
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
general's office could do which would
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
kick in and that could be completed
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
as you suggested i guess i'd ask one
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
last question what
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
what's specifically in the host version
 
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.230 align:start position:0%
what's specifically in the host version
what

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
what language in there as it's written
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
is problematic to the senate
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically um again i wrote that uh
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
probably two or three months ago now wow
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
number of absolutely ballots requested
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
by mail
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
never sent to an address other than the
 
00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
never sent to an address other than the
check

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes i mean speaking for myself because i
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken about the bill at this
 
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken about the bill at this
point

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
the problem that i have with the house
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
version is introduced is
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
lines 17 and 20 now making
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
the reason that you had to put in the
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
provision was because you're now making
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't public
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
publicly available so i think
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
that in and of itself leads to second
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
guessing potentially of what the
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and attorney general
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
is if the idea is solely to do the
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
investigation then
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're information of any problem will
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
be made public
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
but okay um
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
i can see what you're saying uh i think
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of that i don't want to speak
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
what would be the downside except if we
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
have a pause in there to protect people
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
that are under protective order
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
what would be the problem with
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
public doing that well they're not
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
immediate once again so you know if
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's away
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're not at their home it's
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
not something that's currently available
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
law is for the secretary's office and
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
the attorney general to do an
 
00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
the attorney general to do an
investigation

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
then why don't we let them go about
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
their business if we're now going to
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
make these lists public it means that
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
all of the clerks will have to
 
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
all of the clerks will have to
re-examine

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
re-examine
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um their list to ensure that if there
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
are protective orders and i'm sure there
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
are throughout the city
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
that they're in compliance with them the
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
orders are sometimes specific to date
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
once again it's another layer of
 
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.430 align:start position:0%
once again it's another layer of
bureaucracy

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
that may or may not get to anything
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right so i'll kind of throw this out
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
there and then once the
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
client so if that language was
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
17 and 21 away if it would support the
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
wording of the rest of the
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
thesis personally i think it's true
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
the language here is too prescriptive
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
again i'm willing to consider anything
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
write and send me okay i'm happy with
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
the sentence version of this
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
i will support the senate's version of
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
this and that if you
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
want to do something different i'm not
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
going to say yes or no on the phone
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
and i believe that keeping it in
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
the sec the attorney general's office
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
protects any investigation any
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
prosecution that might come from this
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
i would be willing to go that the
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying it comes out of
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
the database of the secretary of state
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
so prepare it
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know coming out of the database and
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
i want
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit of freedom
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
in what they're investigating because
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
i couldn't predict this pandemic no
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
matter how hard i try
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
but understand when we're talking about
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
it had whatever we put whatever's put
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
together has to either be
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
either the senate version the house
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
version or a combination of both
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
senator no i'm doing it um
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
senator bird sells comments about
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
one thing or the other or
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't think
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
that there would be a problem uh taking
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
the language from one of the other
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any additional
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
language that's that's necessary
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
i did have a quick comment uh for
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
senator susie
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
the reason that that was changed
 
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.349 align:start position:0%
the reason that that was changed
initially

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
to require public inspection only with
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
court order
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
was as a protection from someone knowing
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
that someone isn't going to be in that
 
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
that someone isn't going to be in that
home

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
during that time i
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned in testimony a couple of times
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
over a couple of different years
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
that 60 days is not anything magical
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't care if it's 365 days
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
i don't care if it's the next year it
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
just seems to me at some point
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
this information from the election but
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
not including any of those protective
 
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.630 align:start position:0%
not including any of those protective
order

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
individuals none of that information
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
should be included
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that was a suggestion from senator
 
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
and that was a suggestion from senator
gray

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
gray
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
last year i think um
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
but the 60 days it's magical that could
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
be anything
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
um it just seems to me that the
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
information should be available for the
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
public to
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow up and say you know gee 23
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
ballots went to
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
a high-rise apartment in the center of
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
boston um
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
fine and uh and then go check to see
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a college dorm it's a high-rise
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
luxury apartment in boston
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
that should be of interest i would think
 
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
that should be of interest i would think
so

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think you can come up with something
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
that combines both
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
parts of this you're talking around each
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
other actually
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
um when would you be available
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
would would uh thursday morning be a
 
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:04.630 align:start position:0%
possibility before session
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.069 align:start position:0%
possibility before session

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
just to add i think you should
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely have one more attempt
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
at a mutual draft i think the house side
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be more than willing to contact
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
ols and get that amendment started and
 
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.589 align:start position:0%
ols and get that amendment started and
circulated

00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
circulated
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
among the senators and i'm sure
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling we could figure out
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards by thought with their
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
assistance and so on
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much then
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
many members i am
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
but i now i have an 8 30
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
thursday morning i think i'm done
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
what when is there a deadline when this
 
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.990 align:start position:0%
what when is there a deadline when this
happens

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
thursday tuesday to sign off and that's
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
the house version is a perfect step one
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the senate virgin just
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
amazing observation
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
is a set there's a part two is extension
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think that easily they can be
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
matched together and we'll do our best
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
to make that happen and work with your
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
staff to hopefully meet again by
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
all right with that you're going to have
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
to contact uh set at the house clerk
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
anyway to
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
right to find the time so yeah all right
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can offer the time
 
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:42.490 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can offer the time
between

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:42.500 align:start position:0%

all right uh let's begin with
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps that one of the senators
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
would like to explain
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
some of the changes that you've made
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
first that i was introduced to this
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
service woman
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
eight contacted me she was having
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
problems getting one of the lists from
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
the town
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
park and trying to get that
 
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
park and trying to get that
electronically

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
with that information and what was in
 
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.670 align:start position:0%
with that information and what was in
the

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill that came here um
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
i told her that hey she shouldn't have
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for it because if it
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
was given to her electronically rsr 91a
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
already says that uh pretty much if
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
unless they're putting on a thumb drive
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
and then they can charge you a
 
00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:54.630 align:start position:0%
and then they can charge you a
reasonable

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
fee for the thumb drive but that
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any more than five or ten
 
00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.430 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any more than five or ten
products

00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh that they should be able to get it so
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
i tried to pare this down
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
to just the essentials on here is that
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
if they have the right to get it they
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
can get it
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
and get it electronically and that
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
the things about the pain you know
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you didn't have to pay ahead of
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
time and all that all
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
disappear you know when you get it
 
00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.069 align:start position:0%
disappear you know when you get it
electronic

00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the house madam
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
chair yes
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so basically the two
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
kind of hit on the two differences
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
between the two versions
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
one is that the house version prohibits
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
the clerks from requiring
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
a free payment from the list and
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
gives seven days to pay for the
 
00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.430 align:start position:0%
gives seven days to pay for the
information

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
so perhaps somebody else the house might
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
like to comment on why that
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing um well i'm the
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this one
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
so let me kind of explain um my
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
rationale and the way i wanted this
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
crafted so i tried to craft the least
 
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.910 align:start position:0%
crafted so i tried to craft the least
objectionable

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
objectionable
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
um way to get list possible so currently
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
they can charge for the list um i i
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
didn't want to wait into that
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
i personally agree that they should be
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
charging for something that they already
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
have electronically and producing
 
00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
have electronically and producing
electronically

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i didn't want to wade into that
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
world i wanted to try to give us the
 
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.190 align:start position:0%
world i wanted to try to give us the
best

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
work method of passing so
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
if you guys are readable to just drop in
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
the payment entirely
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm all on board with that that's
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
really not an issue with me
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
that was in there to make this more
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
palatable to everybody but apparently
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:36.630 align:start position:0%
palatable to everybody but apparently
that's

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
made it unpalatable so i have no problem
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
with that leaving
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i do have a
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
question and then one issue so the
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
question is is why was it changed to
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
the state centralized voter registration
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
database versus the list that the clerks
 
00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:54.790 align:start position:0%
database versus the list that the clerks
keep

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that's question one um and my issue
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
which will remark up is the language of
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
may instead of shout
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
because they the whole purpose of the
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill is shall
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
and by putting in may in my at least the
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
way i read it and i'm totally up to be
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
told why i'm wrong
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
because that basically uh makes the
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh the reason that i went to the
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
centralized database is
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
that was the resolution that we came up
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the woman that contacted senator
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
ward originally is that the clerk was
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
the one that was telling him no
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
and when i contacted the secretary of
 
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.750 align:start position:0%
and when i contacted the secretary of
state

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
and we went over the rsa he says that's
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'll take care of that we can get that
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
information right out of the centralized
 
00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.670 align:start position:0%
information right out of the centralized
database

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
so if the information is in there which
 
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
so if the information is in there which
even

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know the voter rolls are in there
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
after a period of time
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
because they take the information off of
 
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
because they take the information off of
the

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
check-in list and enter it into the
 
00:45:57.599 --> 00:45:58.710 align:start position:0%
check-in list and enter it into the
database

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a wealth of information that
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
are in there that is in there
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
changing uh if requested this list may
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know i guess the reason i left the
 
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
you know i guess the reason i left the
may

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
in there is because of some of the
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh clerks in the north country okay
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
okay now you know
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i wouldn't go from may to
 
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.390 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i wouldn't go from may to
shao

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
shao
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
unless i had some kind of weasel word to
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
take care of the people
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
in yeah small towns graceville notch
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
i'll make a brand new
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's everything
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
that does everything on paper you know
 
00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
that does everything on paper you know
or

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know still has an ibm's electric you
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
know that they type stuff on
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the reason that
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
probably injured my mind as i was
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
writing this from
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know not saying shall because they
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
may not be capable of doing it
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
but also there there wouldn't be many
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
people on that list
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
so the cost of it at 50 cents a page
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
which is what
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
the judicial system uh
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
has been charging and and we've copied
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
that you know through other things
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
what if you did something with
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying language that said
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
if if an electronic copy exists they
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
shall provide
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
to me i was just writing yeah
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't even do it i'm sensitive to
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
some degrees concerned and tried to
 
00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
some degrees concerned and tried to
address

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
without charge because if we don't
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
downforce from charging rsa 91a already
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think covers that fairly well
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
i see pam over there shaking their heads
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i just don't know i don't think i'm
 
00:47:59.359 --> 00:48:00.549 align:start position:0%
yeah i just don't know i don't think i'm
lying

00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
lying
 
00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
lying
okay

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's my fair share of those i think
 
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
that's my fair share of those i think
now

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
remember rsa918 i've had people go in
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
with their own
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
copy machines i have had people go in
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
with scanners
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
i've had people go in with cameras okay
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so there's any number of ways to get
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know this case
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
you know with that list um you know if
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
you had a scanner and scan it to a pdf
 
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.470 align:start position:0%
you had a scanner and scan it to a pdf
file

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
file
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's an electronic copy so again
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know as long as uh
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know the the town or city you know
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
purchases a bunch of thumb drives and
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
sells them to you
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know at or near cost
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not talking a lot of
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
dollars yeah the others i brought up
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
because i've had some
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
time books so they want to charge for
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
this that's it's all good and i agree
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we had one of those in just
 
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
that we had one of those in just
participate

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay and that all it took is
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes conversation with
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
and it was resolved i i've had those
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
conversations but they didn't bear as
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
much further shorts which is why
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
this exists maybe maybe you know
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
they used to use a sawdust when they
 
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.470 align:start position:0%
they used to use a sawdust when they
were

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
speak for everybody outside but that we
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
could live with with that
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know fee and did i hear that maybe
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
you could tighten the link a little bit
 
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.549 align:start position:0%
you could tighten the link a little bit
from

00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
if we kind of eliminate the
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
paid piece of it or um
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
or not specify right now we can see i
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
think we can see how it works and if we
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
are um maybe charging then maybe we can
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm sorry
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
would this language work uh
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
if requested and if the list is
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
available electronically the list
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
shall be supplied electronic truck
 
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
shall be supplied electronic truck
electronically

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
at no charge to the opposite and it just
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
simply makes it clear in election law
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
i can't beat that because they need to
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
be able to charge for that thumb drive
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay that's again settled stuff that
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
we've done in rsa-91a
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
but you can also and electronically you
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
so maybe it needs to be specified even
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
further down
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
that if it's a thumb drive they can
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
charge if it's
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
um via email but you could say
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
physical electronic copy which i know
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
sounds weird but would send the message
 
00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:54.150 align:start position:0%
sounds weird but would send the message
of

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
if they're asking for a cd or a thumb
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
drive that then they can charge but if
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
which try to make it easier on him okay
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
any charge will be in accordance with
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think that might do it for uh
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
your committee assistant and me and a
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
couple other people too
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's fine that's fine on
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
my end but then i would need to see
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
the language about um the prepayment put
 
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:26.710 align:start position:0%
the language about um the prepayment put
back

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
in because there is there's time
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
sensitive to this list
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i have had a town clerk say i will
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
not give you this list until i have my
 
00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
not give you this list until i have my
money

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
in hand um and i will only give it to
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
you in paper
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
so i i it's i that's why those triggers
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
are in there because an absentee ballot
 
00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:44.790 align:start position:0%
are in there because an absentee ballot
list

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
seven days later is worthless that that
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
basketball has gone out and has been
 
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.430 align:start position:0%
basketball has gone out and has been
returned

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
returned
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is over i understand
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
that we have some clerks out there
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
that don't understand the rules as well
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
as others
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
but i mean we're taking something
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
that you know even in your version with
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
only five lines
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
and my version was uh not quite two
 
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.069 align:start position:0%
and my version was uh not quite two
lines

00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
and he's already up to four six
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
eight maybe that's just my big right
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask the question again
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
in your language we simply add at the
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
end of that
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
so if requested the list may be split
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
electronically from the information
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
statewide central life or restriction
 
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
statewide central life or restriction
database

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
in accordance with 91a could we add that
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
just i know it's there but if
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
to do the minimum requirement
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
if it says is it your agreement within
 
00:52:54.559 --> 00:53:12.390 align:start position:0%
if it says is it your agreement within
accordance

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
so if it said if requested
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the list is available electronically
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
it and if you want to put the word
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
shall in there because we've got the
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
other qualifying words
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
these fees consistent with
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a that's all that's all fine with
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
me i'm not trying to stop the towns from
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
getting their due or any of that just
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to get access to the
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
list that
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
candidates are a statewide list
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
you the parties get to they get it every
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
eight days
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
which is not not enough um with the way
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
with the speed of an absolute ballot
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
eight days is
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's old it's it's you really if you're
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to run it
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
so this is focused on the community
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the community so if you're
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
in a smaller district you should be able
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
to go back
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
in manchester um we have a great clerk
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
and great staff and they email us every
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.190 align:start position:0%
and great staff and they email us every
day

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
all of the changes um so they email us
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
and they they bills at the end
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
of uh they built at the end of the cycle
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
um and it's great and if every town
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
in this state or city in the state that
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
had the capacity to do that did that
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
that would be awesome but
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
they don't um and it's a little bit of a
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
pain sometimes because it comes in pdf
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
and you have to sit there
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
and then punch it all out but it gets
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
the job done and that's part of running
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
for office and campaign
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
take a little time out of that um but
 
00:54:56.319 --> 00:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
take a little time out of that um but
other

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh clerks i'm not about to it's over
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
here but other clerks want you to drive
 
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.190 align:start position:0%
here but other clerks want you to drive
in

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
while they're open um which is not
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
always available for some of us who have
 
00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:06.789 align:start position:0%
always available for some of us who have
jobs

00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
um show up and if they don't they have
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
to show up with a notarized list from
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
from you
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
with money in their hand um for an
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
amount that
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they're going to
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
charge yet and that can create some
 
00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:18.549 align:start position:0%
charge yet and that can create some
chaos

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
chaos
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to eliminate the chaos from
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
the list when the windowless is already
 
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.190 align:start position:0%
the list when the windowless is already
available

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
just email it um i i don't know why
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's an issue for some parts but it is
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
so if if if we deal with the
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
language for the electronic that when
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's available electronically it shall
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
be supplied
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
if it's in accordance with the fees of
 
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.309 align:start position:0%
if it's in accordance with the fees of
91a

00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
then electronic without a
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
disk or a drive would be free that will
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
deal with it in the vast majority of
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
city and congress
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
i would think so yeah and is that
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable to use that
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
that doesn't touch the few towns that
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
only have a
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
physical paper list but i think i think
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're covering
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
probably 90 percent of the towns and 99
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
percent of the voters that like yeah
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
i would say so we can we can work
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
language to that get it out to guys
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know if your amendment you know
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
it comes out the way you said it but
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
we could just not have another meeting
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
with your rules uh i think you guys
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
we get the language out to you
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other things that i need
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
what would normally happen is that we're
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
actually two committees here
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's a committee of the house and
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's the committee of the senate and
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
i've seen the senators both shaking
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
their heads up and down
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is a good sign and i'll let you
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
i said this might be my only
 
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
is that if you think about the rest of
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
the content of that bill
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
and the upping of the limit to file the
 
00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:25.349 align:start position:0%
and the upping of the limit to file the
report

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes not a damn house member would would
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know it would be a very rare
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
occasion that they would ever even
 
00:58:33.440 --> 00:59:12.549 align:start position:0%
occasion that they would ever even
follow

00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
that's like six or seven towns that's
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
not that's
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
18 000 registered voters and then the
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
census blocks they were set twenty seven
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
thousand people
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
so that's not enough for a state rep
 
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
so that's not enough for a state rep
that's

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
a lot you don't know but it's gonna
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
remember we have a real map right so
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the this is the bill
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
that uh changed the primary date in new
 
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.829 align:start position:0%
that uh changed the primary date in new
hampshire

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
from september and as amended by the
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
senate to
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
august um the
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the first place we are
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
august is is a uh we can live with that
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh we understand your reasons for doing
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
it i've talked to senator gray at length
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
and understand the reasons and what the
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
um there were
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
two changes that we've talked about and
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
would like to make to it
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh we feel uh one is very minor and that
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
is to change it from the second week of
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
august to the first week of august
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
in the time that a winning candidate of
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
a primary has
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
and this is particularly true in in the
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
statewide races of governor and u.s
 
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:34.710 align:start position:0%
statewide races of governor and u.s
senator

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
and in the and in the house races it's
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
very important that they have more time
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
to consolidate their
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
their support uh after winning a primary
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be a bitterly
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
contested primary but
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
very often they are and it just gives
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
the winning candidate of either party
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
a chance to consolidate their support
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
and the other thing
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
is that we would like to change the
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh we currently have it in january of
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
2023 we'd like to change it to
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
january of 2022 make it effective for
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
the next election and i know there's a
 
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.230 align:start position:0%
the next election and i know there's a
concern

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
about uh the redistricting and how that
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
might impact it
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
and we can address those concerns so
 
01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:20.630 align:start position:0%
and we can address those concerns so
that's

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh by way of introduction where we'd be
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
starting with this so um senators if you
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that and then council members
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
well i have a major concern about
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
changing the date to january 1st 2022.
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be in the middle of a
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
register number one
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
this past with the changes has passed
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
the senate by 20 i think it's 24 to
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.270 align:start position:0%
the senate by 20 i think it's 24 to
nothing

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
i'm really and our biggest concern in
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
the senate is the redistricting piece
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
um chances are even with redistricting
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
we may be going forward
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be a long time before
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
we get any
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
clear ideas of what the district's going
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
so rather than impeding the election in
 
01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:11.029 align:start position:0%
so rather than impeding the election in
2022

01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think i do think it needs to be passed
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
2022 and i
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal side and the governor's side
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
but i think doing this
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
in doing a change like this
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the um redistricting is going to
 
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
with the um redistricting is going to
just

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
be a disaster
 
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
be a disaster
i

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:45.410 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
my concern is if we bring it back to 20
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
january 1st 2022
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we have redistricting and i think
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a disaster
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
can i give you some pushback on that
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so when you look at registered gain
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
from 10 years ago there were three
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that were brought forward
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
they were all finished up in a month and
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe they passed participating in
 
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.470 align:start position:0%
i believe they passed participating in
january

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the even year which is effectively
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
when we would be passing registering
 
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.069 align:start position:0%
when we would be passing registering
anyways

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
so those lawsuits were brought forward
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
they were settled
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
in in a month um since then there's
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
obviously been
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of new case law about reaching
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
thankfully not with new hampshire
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
but on the federal side specifically the
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
federal courts have
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
walked away from it um they've actually
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
given the state legislators even more
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
latitude than they had 10 years ago um
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
the only real challenges would come out
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
of state board which is where they were
 
01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
of state board which is where they were
settled

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
settled
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
last time um so i don't um i appreciate
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about that i look at
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
the history and i say all right is this
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
this is potentially a thing um and i
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
said when i introduced 98
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
to your body that i am under no
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
delusions that
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
no matter what happens someone somewhere
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
is bringing a lawsuit forward to some
 
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
is bringing a lawsuit forward to some
judge

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not a statement about what
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
maps will look like what they could look
 
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.710 align:start position:0%
maps will look like what they could look
like

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's just the nature of the times that
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
we live in so i'm extraordinarily
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
appreciative of that statement um
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
i just think when it's a statement that
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
i could make every ten years
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
um regardless of just next year right i
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
could make that i could sit down in ten
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
years and say we gotta move this back
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
because we're gonna get sued
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to be that
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
we've never other states have not had
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
this problem before
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
even with a second week of august i mean
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
first week of august
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
and what would that make the filing
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
so so if the if the laws passed the laws
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
passed ostensibly in january
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
january march april may right january
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
march april may so that's roughly
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
four months let's say three just for the
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
sake of argument to take away
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislative back and forth whatever
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
so that's three times as long as it took
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
to settle last time
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
um in in with
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
with case law that is now argued not
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
arguably it is more friendly to state
 
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:21.910 align:start position:0%
arguably it is more friendly to state
legislators

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the federal courts and i think was a
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
decision out of arizona
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
um said that uh the supreme court said
 
01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
um said that uh the supreme court said
that

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh drawing district lines is a political
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
matter to be handled by the political
 
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.190 align:start position:0%
matter to be handled by the political
body

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
um now that doesn't mean there can't be
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
state challenges i'm sure there will be
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
um but if i was bringing a lawsuit
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
forward federal court would not be where
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
i would look
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
um and i can appreciate what you're
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
saying however
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
i when i was working on the independent
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago in that meeting
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
i specifically got we got
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a fact but they well it's a
 
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
it's not a fact but they well it's a
fact

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
that they said no matter if this doesn't
 
01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:05.589 align:start position:0%
that they said no matter if this doesn't
pass

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
the independent redistricting no matter
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
who wins the
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
bodies we're taking you to court so
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i have concerns because i think it's
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to go a lot longer than you think
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i and i can i try to just push back
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
on one of these
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
the presumption that it's going to be
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
done in january
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
is i don't believe it's
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
first of all the cities you know they
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
have time to weigh in and do their own
 
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.829 align:start position:0%
have time to weigh in and do their own
redistricting

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
because until you've done that you don't
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
know how those state rep races
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know are going to to even certainly
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know looking at the constitution
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
no provision here in new hampshire that
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
if a town
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
or city has enough people but then that
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
seems to conflict a lot of times
 
01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:04.069 align:start position:0%
seems to conflict a lot of times
especially

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know in small towns that are next to
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
big towns that are
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
on either county borders or state
 
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
on either county borders or state
borders

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
borders
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
in my district i shouldn't say in my
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
district but in stratfor county
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's rollinsburg you know there has to
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
be grouped
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
to somebody because they can't be by
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and then
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
that affects summer's worth which does
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
have enough people to have their own
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know again not quite enough for an
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
even number
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
and then when you try to meet the plus
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
or minus 10
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
that the federal government wants to
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
hold you to the standard
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
and you can't really do some of those
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
things unless
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
and last time i guess the number that
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
they told me
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
was up around 13 to do some of the other
 
01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.309 align:start position:0%
was up around 13 to do some of the other
things

01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
which probably could get a waiver or not
 
01:08:53.199 --> 01:08:53.669 align:start position:0%
which probably could get a waiver or not
be

01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
in trouble with the feds but so
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
i can be optimistic but you know
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say the house was
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not indifferent to the
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
realities of redistricting when cracking
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
um representative rowan included an
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
amendment in the bill that did pass the
 
01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
amendment in the bill that did pass the
house

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
that included trigger language that if
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
we did not have
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
the district map settled i believe it
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
was by april 1st
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
then this law would not be in effect to
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
move the primary until the next election
 
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
move the primary until the next election
cycle

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
if the only disagreement from the senate
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
is that we can't have this next year
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
because we won't have redistricting done
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
by the time filing gets placed can we
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
utilize similar trigger language
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
in a compromise here where if we do have
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the map set
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
by the time that we need to have filing
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
next year for an august primary that we
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
can move forward with an august primary
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
and including in the language of the
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill if we don't have the map set by the
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
time that we would need to have them set
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
for an august 2022 primary
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
move the effective date through a
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
trigger in the bill to
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
2024. there's a lot of pieces
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
there are and i understand that senator
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
what that actually wasn't the amendment
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was approved by the house
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason is i didn't like the idea
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we were passing a bill from this
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting because in 10 years it's
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
been another and 10 years later we've
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
been having another one
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
and so as the law currently reads 655
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
14c says that the secretary of state has
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
the authority to change the filing
 
01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
the authority to change the filing
period

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
if redistricting isn't complete what we
 
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.390 align:start position:0%
if redistricting isn't complete what we
did

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
is added the language on five to seven
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
which you left in
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
that also then allowed the secretary of
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
state to change
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
the date of the primary if necessary
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
and this deals with any redistribution
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
starting in 2022 going to long beyond
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
that affects
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
us uh which means very many monsters
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh but uh probably two more
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
but anyway if you look at that
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of this was to put
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
trigger language in here that will solve
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
it for every redistricting
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
and it does because it allows it allows
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state to change the
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and let's just say you you have a filing
 
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.189 align:start position:0%
and let's just say you you have a filing
period

01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
in here i when we did the amendment in
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
the house and we changed it to
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the fourth week of june we had changed
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
the filing period only two months before
 
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:33.590 align:start position:0%
the filing period only two months before
that

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
because we felt that if a candidate
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
wants to run for office he doesn't have
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
to wait until he files to start
 
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.070 align:start position:0%
to wait until he files to start
campaigning

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
campaigning
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
so we had made it two months so if the
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state goes another month
 
01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.070 align:start position:0%
secretary of state goes another month
later

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
then there's still two months if he goes
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
another two weeks after that
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
still six weeks and people know by then
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
if they're going to be running
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
if it comes to the point that he says
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
yeah now it's getting too close to the
 
01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
yeah now it's getting too close to the
primary

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
this gives him the authority to change
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
the native primary
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
not only in 2022 but in
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
2032 and 42 and 52 and 62.
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so i i i believe senator bird so
 
01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.270 align:start position:0%
and so i i i believe senator bird so
that

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
we have we've covered that here allowing
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
to make the necessary decision
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
if redistricting is not accomplished and
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
senator gray i do agree with you i
 
01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.229 align:start position:0%
senator gray i do agree with you i
appreciate

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative barry's optimism that
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
he that is up to this
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
the trigger language for a power that
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
already exists for the secretary of
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
state specifically
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
this question the first half being the
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
filing date
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
um so if if that's in there
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it's not my uh you know optimistic
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
world view what the sun's always shining
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
um we have language to fix that but
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think we would be we have an
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get this going now
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
um and to also solve this question
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
like representative bruhn said going
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
like representative bruhn said going
forward

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
um and i can actually make the argument
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
that it's actually set the president of
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
even when there is
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
when there's future legislators sitting
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
here having this debate in 30 years
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to look back and say
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
well they had this problem back in 2022
 
01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:22.709 align:start position:0%
well they had this problem back in 2022
and

01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
they let the secretary of state decide
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i if i could add i did pass around
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
the primary dates
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
and initially when i had
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
when we were doing the executive session
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
i am given the primary dates and i did
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
it on the basis of
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
2020 which was substantially different
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
from this because
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
many primary dates have been changed
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
because of copenhagen
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is the these are the primary dates
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
of what they would have been in 2020 had
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
the uh had we not had uh covert
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
and you see primaries the first one
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
being november prior to the election and
 
01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.550 align:start position:0%
being november prior to the election and
then

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
march april may june and june and august
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
be in the heaviest months
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
and then i just for interest i put in
 
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.550 align:start position:0%
and then i just for interest i put in
that

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
the first week of august is the heaviest
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
one and then it's
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of them during the
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
week and then the second week in the
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
third week of august
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
so you know we're most
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
states recognize this and and most
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
states are dealing with
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're all dealing with just like we
 
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
they're all dealing with just like we
are

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
and yet you know their primary dates are
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
significantly earlier but
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
13 of them are in office and so
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so anyway senator burton does that
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
i absolutely support the change in the
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
day advancing the date and i would be
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay with
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
the first or second week of august and
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with that
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
having granted whoever that this is not
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know in any way of the utmost
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
granting authority to determine what
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
filing period is is very different than
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislators saying an election an
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
election that involves the entire state
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:24.330 align:start position:0%
changed by one individual based
 
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:32.229 align:start position:0%
changed by one individual based
[Music]

01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill's defense we already have that
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
provision with the presidential primary
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
where the secretary can choose the date
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
depending on what other states do
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
i that i i understand but and that
 
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
i that i i understand but and that
protect

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
that actually is for the protection of
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
our first of the nation
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
correct yes not necessarily the state
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
primarily but the concept of allowing
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
one office to set the date of the
 
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
one office to set the date of the
election

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
is already existing in state law so we
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be rewriting the wheel here
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
is that right this is a little
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
biggest legislator sitting around this
 
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:18.950 align:start position:0%
biggest legislator sitting around this
table

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're more comfortable with the secret
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
state being able to move the actual
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
primary data or the finally finally the
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
final i have no issue with the filing
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
because the filing is relative to
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
candidates that's not something that
 
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.709 align:start position:0%
candidates that's not something that
impacts

01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
when voters i mean it making the change
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
in and of itself of the primary date
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
i think will require educating voters
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
and getting them up to speed that they
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
need to plan differently and accordingly
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
um our communities are going to have to
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
make arrangements many use
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
schools in various public buildings so
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
they'll have to
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that those are ready and
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
so you you um you i agree with the
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
obvious there's no question
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
so uh you genuinely believe
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
um we know where my head is at i'm
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting but you you there's a
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
generally held position that we won't
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
have registration sorted out by each
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
of next year which would be roughly if
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's ability to move the
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
filing date that's why i want to ask the
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
clarifying question because i
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
in my brain i heard i'm okay with moving
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
the primary but not the final data
 
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
the primary but not the final data
that's

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
that didn't compute when it went in um
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
looking back at the filing dates that
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay like 7th of june seems like one of
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
the earlier ones that we've had
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
and so now if we move it from the
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
second week in september to the first
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
week in august
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
i'm actually talking about you know 25th
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
27th 28th of april
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so now when would i have to have
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting done
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
probably at least a month if not two
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
months before that
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
and so now you know i'm back in the you
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
know the end of february
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
for the governor to sign it and then
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really give any
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
any period of time other than you know
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
that two months to settle
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
any lawsuit that might be generated from
 
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
any lawsuit that might be generated from
that

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
but it but against senator gray
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
the in the first place the
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
your filing period in in your version
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
is the first week um
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so if it if the if the secretary of
 
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
yeah so if it if the if the secretary of
state

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
already has the authority to change the
 
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.790 align:start position:0%
already has the authority to change the
file

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
and if he changes the filing date to the
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
first week of june
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
then there's still two months between
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
that in the general election
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
it changes it to the second or third
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
week there's
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's six or seven weeks
 
01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
you know there's six or seven weeks
between

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
the filing date and the general election
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
and and most likely i think most likely
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state is going to
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
shorten the filing period he's not going
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
to take the first option of changing the
 
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:06.790 align:start position:0%
to take the first option of changing the
primary

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
changing the primary would be a last
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
resort if it gets down to three weeks or
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
five weeks or something like that
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
that he would change the primary day and
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it is is
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
if let's say we pass it for 2023
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
in 2032 this same issue is going to come
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
up and the secretary of state
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
is going to have authority to change the
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
primary date
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
along with the along with the filing
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what's in the
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the final senate version of the law
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's already there
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
and in 2032 it's going to happen he will
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
have that authority
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i would i would contend that i don't
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
see it as any less likely that that's
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to be contentious in 2032 than in
 
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
going to be contentious in 2032 than in
2020.

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh it certainly is not less contentious
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
in 2022 than it was in 2012.
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
and so i i i would yes could i just add
 
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
and so i i i would yes could i just add
representatives

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the concern is in 2032
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
if we have passed this law and it goes
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
into effect on january 1st
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
of 2023 we know what our timeline is in
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
our time period
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
if this law isn't passed no matter how
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
long the redistricting takes place
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
we know we have a september primary on
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
the books
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the issue is more trying to
 
01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
so i think the issue is more trying to
make

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
two significant changes statewide
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
at the same time if if we could
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
settle the redistricting then as i said
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
i completely support
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
moving the primary i thought june was a
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
little early but i complete
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we haven't even
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned is i think our state
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
barely complies with federal law getting
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
you brought this up because we have to
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
move um 2022
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
in regards as it is right now you will
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
call the ballots
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
and it won't be the first time we've
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
been sued for that um so
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're to to further complicate this
 
01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
we're to to further complicate this
already

01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
complicated issue we're moving the date
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
anyways by a week so now we're talking
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
about another
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
four weeks right um to just further
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
complicate that and
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
to go back to my point um even though i
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
am an optimist
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
i i would rather start it up in 2022
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
when we're at the move anyways then do a
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
different date of 2022 than we did in
 
01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
different date of 2022 than we did in
2020

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
and do a different 2024 than we did in
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
2022 because that's three separate
 
01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.550 align:start position:0%
2022 because that's three separate
changes

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
and now we now if there is any chance
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
that moving this
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
would have an effective voter turnout
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
now now we are moving
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of goal posts um and that's
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
another reason why i like
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
i like uh i'm okay with august i'm a
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
june guy but i'm okay with
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
august um but i i do not like
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
with the yugo cabo there i don't like
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
three moves uh three different dates and
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
three different cycles and that's not a
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
big fan of it
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
and we actually have another house
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we uh retained
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
that just changes at one week for new
 
01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
that just changes at one week for new
york

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
york
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
because it has to be uh so if if we
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
don't make this change in 2022 then we
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
have to resurrect that bill
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
and get a pass to change it for one week
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.199 --> 01:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
thank um

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:13.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:13.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:28.090 align:start position:0%
despite my neighbors
 
01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
despite my neighbors
[Music]

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
and our recess uh back on
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
senators i didn't know if she was ready
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a few things that i didn't i
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
until we started talking about it we
 
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.270 align:start position:0%
until we started talking about it we
have

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have problems with the
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting in the cities and towns
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
because for instance manchester
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
let's say we get the numbers according
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to get the numbers so
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
august or september
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
um the town the cities are going to have
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
their redistricting we can't put in a
 
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:13.990 align:start position:0%
their redistricting we can't put in a
bill

01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
even if we have the state rep
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
maps can't be drawn until the cities are
 
01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:22.310 align:start position:0%
maps can't be drawn until the cities are
drawn

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the cities have to draw them and
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
there may
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
they may not be even done for the um
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
and it has to go to the voters so they
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
may not even be done for the
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
november elections so now we're pushing
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
um into possibly
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
january so
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to run it we are going to
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
run into
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
a time crunch because if you're if
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
um pushing possibly pushing um
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
the redistricting out to
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
even if we can put a bill in we're going
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
to do it probably a late bill because
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
the top the cities aren't going to be
 
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
the top the cities aren't going to be
ready

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have to get the
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have the bill
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
drawn the gov
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
even if the governor signs it at the end
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
of february
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um then you're going to wind up probably
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to court
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
if i think we're going to run into a
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
major time crunch and i think it's going
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
to be a problem
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and they can they can address the city's
 
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.229 align:start position:0%
and they can they can address the city's
issue

01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
better than i can what i just did the
 
01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
better than i can what i just did the
bills

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
the vehicles already exist um because
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're filed underneath the
 
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.229 align:start position:0%
they're filed underneath the
representative

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
um uh oh my god griffin my chair
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
so sorry i'm so sorry um so it's an
 
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
so sorry i'm so sorry um so it's an
amendment

01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
um but it definitely could be outside of
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
the ordinary process for sure
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
um but i think going back to i think the
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think i think the two sides tables are
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
probably focusing on two different
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
things which is probably
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
the issue of the disagreements uh you
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
guys are
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
understandably um extremely interested
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the filing date we're extremely
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
interested in the actual primary
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
is that a is that a fair statement to
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
say because you guys are
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the window right between
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
the primary and the
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we're i mean speaking
 
01:33:20.719 --> 01:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we're i mean speaking
of

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we're primarily interested in the
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of the redistricting
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
plan right but that's how it's going to
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
how it's going to how it's going to so
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
this is the scenario
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay in manchester uh
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
apparently the ward lines are set up in
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
the chart
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
so to change the ward lines you've got
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
a charter amendment so that's going to
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
be written
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
then it's going to be approved by
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state then it's going to be
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
put on the ballot
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
whether they could get that done with
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
the time limit
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know for a con
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
an election the city election in
 
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
an election the city election in
november

01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
november
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
iffy may be able to do it may not
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
but then you know you got to get back
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to go through the whole
 
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.229 align:start position:0%
it's going to go through the whole
process

01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
so if they miss that november
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
then they're in probably january or so
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
before they're even going to be able to
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
have that election
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know to vote on those board lines
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's when we would be able to start
 
01:34:32.639 --> 01:34:33.189 align:start position:0%
that's when we would be able to start
looking

01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
at how we were going to redistrict both
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
senate house races that go through
 
01:34:39.199 --> 01:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
senate house races that go through
manchester

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
in the rochester somersworth rollins for
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
dover area
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
we know that you have to break something
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
up because they're olives
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
you can't do it okay so
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
and when you take dover and summer's
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
work together
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
you've got pretty much a senate district
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then wrongs for then you may need
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
depending on the numbers you may need
 
01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:08.629 align:start position:0%
depending on the numbers you may need
some

01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
other like barrington or something
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
again you know so but
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
senator gray i mean this is
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is the norm for every redistricting
 
01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.350 align:start position:0%
this is the norm for every redistricting
year

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't unique to this year and in
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
normal years
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
we have had our filing period begin in
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
we have had our filing period begin in
june

01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
june
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
so if the secretary of state
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
groups the fighting period back to
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
june for the first wednesday in june
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
um there is still more time between the
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the primary than we currently have
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
between the primary and the general
 
01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
between the primary and the general
election

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
and and that's sort of the issue we're
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with and
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
i i i'm i'm i understand that my
 
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.590 align:start position:0%
i i i'm i'm i understand that my
compromise

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
is you know accept the senate position
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then we'll work very diligently on
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're retaining
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
in the house to fix any problems that
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
can come up with that
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
it could even change the date of the
 
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.229 align:start position:0%
it could even change the date of the
implementation

01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
but there there is a difference from
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting year this year
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to change the
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
primary in the middle of it that's
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't really changed the primary
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
date when we've had redistricting
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we've run if i recall uh i don't
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
think we had in
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
2010 or 2011 we didn't have a
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting unit in 2012.
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's 2012 2012. so
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah they're there and if we had tried
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
to move that
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
primary back then it would have been uh
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
trouble too
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
but there is a difference between any
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
redistricting year because we're trying
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move you're trying to
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
move the primary in the same year and
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be run into a real
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem that's why
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know the senate position is january
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
1st 2023
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of problems that
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
you haven't thought about
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
but if we could still have an august
 
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.229 align:start position:0%
but if we could still have an august
primary

01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022 where filing for candidates
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
is the same time as it would be anyways
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
for a september primary in 2022
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
why can't we agree to an august primary
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why i said if we take this
 
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
and that's why i said if we take this
bill

01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
whether we change the one thing from
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
from the second week in august to the
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
first week in august
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
leave the effective date to 23 and then
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
in january you've got your bill that
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
you've retained okay
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
and we can make adjustments based on
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
that bill when i have
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
more information so
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
you go we for the effective date
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much hard over on the 20th you
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
know doing it for 23.
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay so if you want to get there
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
the path to get there is your retained
 
01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
the path to get there is your retained
bill

01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
you've got it you can work on it between
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
now and january
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
within the second session you know in
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
january or whatever the rules and the
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
house are right now
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
about passing it and get it to us when
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
we have more information
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
so in the scenario though that next
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
year's primary bill for you acaba
 
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.750 align:start position:0%
year's primary bill for you acaba
changes

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
also goes to a comedian conference and
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're here next month
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
debating the primary date that's four
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
months away
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a lot of moving
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
pieces that we're seeing to be trying to
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
avoid today
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
so why can't we just solve it now i i i
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
i see senator gray's point in that
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we take our
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
retain bill and we pass that on to the
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
senate the first
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
february of next year by then we will
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
better picture of where redistricting is
 
01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:19.990 align:start position:0%
better picture of where redistricting is
and

01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
at that point if in the first place the
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
the bill that that bill deals with one
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
week change in the primary
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
just to meet the recovery departments
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
at that point when we have a better
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
grasp and where
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
where the senate probably wouldn't act
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
on that bill until
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
march or april you know then
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
we would have a really good idea and
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
part of it if part of that fill
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
we said yeah we're moving the primary
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're moving the effective date of
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the august first primary to 2022
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
instead of 2023
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
if that was part of that retained bill
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
is that i'm hearing you say senator greg
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and that we're going to obsess
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
um to act on retained builds is that
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
first second third fourth session you
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's a set number maybe
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
two or three it has to be right
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think that really won't send it early
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
to you so
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we can work on it so uh
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions i'm not not totally opposed to
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed here
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh committee of conference on your end
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
happens to also be the election law
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee which is convenient
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and i know each of each of you well
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i know you're all honest brokers um
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
but what are going to be
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
some of the things we go forward with
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
this this plan to use this retained bill
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
what are going to be some of the things
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
that you guys are going to look at
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
specifically not i'm not saying it has
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be this or they're not going to do
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
any that i'm just
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
i want to get a general sense of the
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
feel of things that you guys are going
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
to look for um you know like
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
for me for like an indicator for me
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
right if i was sitting in your seat
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i would say well i want to see
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
something passed out of both bodies by
 
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
something passed out of both bodies by
february

01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
february
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
right that would just be something that
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
like i would draw a line and say
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not done by then
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
because that everything that's just for
 
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:18.950 align:start position:0%
because that everything that's just for
me

01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
but what would be something you guys
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
would look at redistricting
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the various cities that are going to
 
01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.310 align:start position:0%
in the various cities that are going to
be

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
those places where either senate
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
or rep lines are going to go through we
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
tried not to break up
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know higher offices but i
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't know an executive
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
council if i ever
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
if we ever have one that goes through
 
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.229 align:start position:0%
if we ever have one that goes through
nashua

01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
or breaks nashua or manchester up i
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't think there's this issue
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
so again the ones that i'm going to be
 
01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:53.830 align:start position:0%
so again the ones that i'm going to be
looking

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
at is how rochester someone's worked
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
over rollinsford
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
that area breaks up i'm sure that
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
senator susie will be looking at
 
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
senator susie will be looking at
manchester

01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
united we'll be looking at nashua
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
and those are the big hubs and if
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're moving along quickly
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
i have no problem in going to um
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
and august at 22. but again i
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not willing to do that now i really
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
i believe you and i trust all of you
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay so you're you will agree to
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
changing the date
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the first week of august yeah yeah
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
with the current effective date of 23.
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
with the current effective data 2023
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
a gentle person's understanding that if
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
the pathway exists for an effective date
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
for 2022
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
full-blown with that that's agreeable
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and i can work on that
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
majority leader but we can work on the
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
i do know that the secretary of state
 
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:23.669 align:start position:0%
i do know that the secretary of state
has

01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
and certainly it'll depend upon what the
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
governor does also
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
but again by the january timeframe when
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this other
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that we'll
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the house side agreement with that i
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
