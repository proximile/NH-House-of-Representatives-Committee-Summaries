00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
land agent our three primary
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
focuses are game management non-game and
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
threat endangered species
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and habitat management the division
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
budget is
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
five and a half million dollars which is
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
roughly 16
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
of the total department budget funding
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
is very
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
diverse then from things such as
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated revenue associated with
 
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
dedicated revenue associated with
permits

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
permits
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are dedicated for
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
jim represents splain if you can keep
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
attention to the
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
attendees list and add him back in when
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
so welcome to the world of zoom and
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
public meetings
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
yeah before this is kind of what it's
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
like here we go
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay this is mark ellingwood can you
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
confirm that you hear me
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
we can thank you very much
 
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
we can thank you very much
representative

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh what we do our primary
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
focus is game management the setting of
 
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
focus is game management the setting of
seasons

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
seasons
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
the management of those species that
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
constitute game species within the state
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
that stems from everything from moose
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
deer beer and turkey
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
to waterfall on the coast of the state
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
and everything in between
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
in total we manage something on the
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
order of 30 species
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
these species are critically important
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
to uh both recreational and economic
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
interests of the state
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
not to mention the ecological values
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
that they represent to our citizenry
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
our non-gaming endangered species
 
00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.310 align:start position:0%
our non-gaming endangered species
program

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
focuses on 51 threatening endangered
 
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.069 align:start position:0%
focuses on 51 threatening endangered
species

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
but also includes a significant number
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
of species of greatest conservation need
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
and the mantra within the program is to
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
keep common species common
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
much of what that program does is
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
monitor and protect those species
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
protect critical habitats and provide
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
technical services to a diverse group of
 
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
technical services to a diverse group of
people

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
and interests that uh share our values
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
regarding non-game species
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
our wildlife habitat program entails
 
00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:07.269 align:start position:0%
our wildlife habitat program entails
both

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
the purchase and protection of critical
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitats
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
we have sixty thousand acres that we
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
actively manage
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have an additional twenty thousand
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
acres in easement
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities relating to that work
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
include not only habitat management but
 
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
include not only habitat management but
also

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
also infrastructure management and a
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
host of stewardship responsibilities
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
that accompanies
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
our ownership of those fast lands we
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
also are very vested in technical
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
outreach regarding forest management for
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
the good of wildlife in the state
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
we fund the wildlife extension
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
specialist at unh
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
and we are heavily vested in their
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
programs in a variety different ways
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps most notably we have a staff
 
00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.030 align:start position:0%
perhaps most notably we have a staff
member

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
up north fully committed to providing
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
technical services to industrial forest
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
land owners
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
and throughout the state we work with
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
landowners to help enhance wildlife
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
values of their property
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
we also are very vested in animal damage
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
control in the state we have dedicated
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
staff that do that work
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
we provide technical services and we
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
also provide uh
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
actual control options through permits
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we lend and provide
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
provisions that help with mitigation
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
such as fencing repellents and scare
 
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.390 align:start position:0%
such as fencing repellents and scare
devices

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
devices
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
finally we have something we call the
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
conflict abatement team
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
a team of a half dozen biologists who
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
are trained in immobilization and
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
handling of wildlife and so they
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
constitute a
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
first response group in terms of a moose
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
on meetings and highways
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
deer in store fronts bears and backyards
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
and homes and so we have that skill set
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%

all right um what i've previously said
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
was my name is jason smith i'm currently
 
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
was my name is jason smith i'm currently
the

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
chief of the inland fisheries division
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
our division is comprised of
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 employees
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
28 of which work in our state hatchery
 
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.390 align:start position:0%
28 of which work in our state hatchery
systems

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and similar to what uh my predecessors
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
in this meeting spoke to we do very
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
similar things as far as species
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
monitoring and habitat protection
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
but on the freshwater resource side of
 
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.750 align:start position:0%
but on the freshwater resource side of
things

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
our division is comprised of six primary
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
focal areas
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have a cold water fisheries program
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
which is primarily focused on clean
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
water species such as brook brown
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
rainbow trout
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of research work movement
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
and habitat use and how to protect those
 
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
and habitat use and how to protect those
areas

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
next we have a warm water program
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
which administers over 500 bass
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
tournaments on annual basis
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
we also work with cool water species
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
such as walleye and northern pike
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh we also work with the new hampshire
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
athletics association
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
and a new program out there we're trying
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
to get kids involved in fishing
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
so we work with all the high schools in
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that are interested in
 
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that are interested in
having

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh competitive fishing tournaments our
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
next program
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
area is what we call our large lakes
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
program they're primarily focused on any
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
body of water
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's great in the 500 acres species
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we manage primarily in these large
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
water bodies and
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
involve landlocked salmon lake trout
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
rainbow trout
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and to a large degree also rainbow smelt
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
the forage base in the uh
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
and the uh what drives the growth and
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
the health of these fish populations
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
we also have what we call a fish
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
conservation program
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
this program works with digest species
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
very similar what charis group does
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
we work on fish passages we work with uh
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
fish ladders to trump truck and trap
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
alewives and shad and try to restore
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
them we used to do a lot of work with
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
the restoration of atlantic salmon but
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
we also write
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh species recovery plans for
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
species the greatest conservation need
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
and our fifth program area is
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
what we call our fish habitat here we do
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
technical sorry we give a lot of
 
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.789 align:start position:0%

uh expertise on regards to stream
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
crossing and fish passage
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
we invest in land conservation projects
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
when we find
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
adequate quality fish habitat areas that
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
we want to protect
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
among amongst a lot of other things and
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
finally we have our
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
fish culture program many of you know
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh across the state we have six
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
state-owned and operated
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
trout and salmon hatcheries they're
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
located in berlin twin mountain
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
warren new hampton milford and our
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
partner mill hatchery in new derm
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
so with that i would entertain any
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr smith for that uh
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and thank you for the
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
hatcheries i've taken all for my kids to
 
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
hatcheries i've taken all for my kids to
almost

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
all of them at some point in time in
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
their life so uh they're excellent
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
little programs
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the um from the
 
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the um from the
committee

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
to uh talk to mr smith in charge of
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
inland fisheries
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
we have a raised hand uh representative
 
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
we have a raised hand uh representative
egan

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
egan
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead representative and meet
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon will there be
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
any requests or bills filed to help the
 
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.310 align:start position:0%
any requests or bills filed to help the
hatcheries

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
hatcheries
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
we know that they've been asked in the
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
past of the legislature
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
do you see the concerns in any of the
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
hatchery development
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that are going to need funding so i
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
you were broken up but i think i got the
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
gist of what you were asking
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah one of our big challenges moving
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
forward as an agency is
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
our most of our hatcheries are near or
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
exceeding 100 years old
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh operating them in their core
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
current format and providing some
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
challenges to meet
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
modern water quality standards so in
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
order to continue to operate
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
the capacity that we're currently
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
operating we're going to need some
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
invest some significant capital into
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of these uh you will see that i've
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
submitted with the department a capital
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that i'm hoping that if we need to talk
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
about its consideration
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
we can find time to do so but those are
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
the types of support that the hatchery
 
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
the types of support that the hatchery
system

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is going to need in order to you know
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
looks like representatives all set any
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
for mr smith i'd like to ask when uh mr
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
sheriff it's okay
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine go ahead thank
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
mr smith given the the situation we're
 
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
mr smith given the the situation we're
in

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
um budget wise in the state ovid last
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
year and whatnot
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
how uh would you prioritize the fish
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
hatcheries over some of the other
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh budget areas that fish and game to be
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh looking to try to sustain
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
and uh how vital is it that those
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
issues get addressed this year versus
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps doing part of the year and part
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the next year i know we're going to
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
be going into a budget cycle and that
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
so it it you know the data clearly
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know stocking trout is a tremendous
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
revenue source for the department and
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
what's critical about this particular
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
revenue source it's what we call
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
so a lot of our fishing license sales
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
goes to fund other parts of the agency
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
but as far as prioritizing any type of
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
immediate needs for infrastructure i
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
our current situation over at power mill
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
and we've had that fishery or fish
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
hatchery come before us before with
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerns so i can
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for mr
 
00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.789 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for mr
smith

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
smith
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
i have a question representative howard
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
all right well you know i'm this is
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
really uh freezing up a lot on me
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully i'll hear his answer uh jason
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering do we have the
 
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.190 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering do we have the
federal

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
discharge permit for the new durham
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
so that permit went into effect on
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
january 1st
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
there being none looks like mr smith

each of you um we spend or i spend a lot
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
of time at the legislature
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
we we're in charge of laws in the state
 
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
we we're in charge of laws in the state
um

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm very passionate about the laws
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
and the changes that come forth
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh because we worry about our
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
constituents and
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
and then i my main concerns with my
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
officers to make stuff that works
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh and the committee has been great to
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
work with for over 10 years now that
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
i've been there
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we're responsible for spending about
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
21 of fishing games budget we're a large
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
group with the largest division
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
within the agency uh i think it's
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
important to understand
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
today that we all work as one big family
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
wildlife priorities the inland fisheries
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
priorities become the law enforcement
 
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.590 align:start position:0%
priorities become the law enforcement
priorities

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
we're supported by a great business
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
division uh we work
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
hand-in-hand with the marine division
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
along our coastline
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's a very cohesive group and it
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
works it works tremendously well
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
together and you'll see that
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully even with this crazy
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
so the law enforcement division does
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
everything that you would expect it to
 
00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:17.909 align:start position:0%
everything that you would expect it to
do

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishermen we're looking for
 
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.669 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishermen we're looking for
compliance

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh voluntary compliance is the goal
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
actually for following the rules and
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
regulations and our bag limits
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
we work with the wildlife division to
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
maintain uh plans for future for
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
resources and habitats and we work to
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
the general public understands that and
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
helps us to reach those goals
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we're also in charge of searching
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
for probably best known for so any event
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
that occurs off the highways in
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
in our woodlands or inland water ways
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
become our responsibility
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
that is a big draw on my officers and
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and many here have heard us discussing
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
these issues that are raised
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
relating to search and rescue we conduct
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
about 180 missions
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
this year was a little higher because of
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
covid we had a lot more people in the
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
outdoors because that was
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think where people felt safer but
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
normally in a normal year we're up to
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
180 to 200 rescues a year
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
i have four of the best k-9 teams in the
 
00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
i have four of the best k-9 teams in the
state

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
by far they're called upon by all other
 
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.069 align:start position:0%
by far they're called upon by all other
agencies

00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
to help them because these dogs are
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
highly trained and do a great job
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
they assist us uh tremendously in search
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
and rescue
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh and that program has run completely
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
off of donations which we're pretty
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
proud of
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so the equipment and the dogs and all
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
the training is done
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
outside of state budgets which is
 
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.190 align:start position:0%
outside of state budgets which is
helpful

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh we have the the best underwater
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh sonar search equipment in the state
 
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.550 align:start position:0%
uh sonar search equipment in the state
now

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i have a really top-notch team that
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
operates it um and so we have the
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
to search at great depths when we can't
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
get divers down
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
and to to conduct accurate and efficient
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
search missions this is used by marine
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
patrol during drowning recoveries when
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
we us
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
we assist in those uh endeavors which we
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
we assist in those uh endeavors which we
do

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
12 to 14 each year we're in charge of
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%

enforcement within the state that has
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
become that has grown
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
tremendously over the last few years
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
exploded really
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the north country those have present
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
some have presented challenges as we
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
have 42 field officers currently in the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
field covering the entire state
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i just want to remind i like to
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
remind folks that the city of concord
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
has 80 police officers on its force
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%

they work real hard to make sure that
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
they meet all of these priorities so we
 
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.589 align:start position:0%
they meet all of these priorities so we
enforce

00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh speed limits and we do all the

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
your time thank you to all members of
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
the committee for
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
this opportunity i i wanted to uh just
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
provide a bit of information about the
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
commission's composition
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
how we're structured and then a little
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
bit more detail on our duties and role
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
and support in the department so in
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
terms of our
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
composition how we're structured we have
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
11 members
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
one from each of the counties so we're
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
geographically diverse
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
we have one member from the seacoast
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
those are the communities that
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
touch our seacoast or great bay and uh
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
all of our terms are for five years
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
occasionally they are shorter because
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
they're filling an unexpired term
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
we all of us go through the governor and
 
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.430 align:start position:0%
we all of us go through the governor and
council

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
process for appointment and annually
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
we elect a chair a vice chair
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
and a secretary treasurer to lead us
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
we principally conduct our
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
work inside our committees inside our
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
full commission meetings
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
we meet monthly as a full commission we
 
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.589 align:start position:0%
we meet monthly as a full commission we
have

00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
approximately eight committees
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
that are all comprised members of the
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
commission several of those
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
are interagency committees
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
they include the lakes advisory
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee the
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
rivers advisory committee both of those
 
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
rivers advisory committee both of those
being

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
also going through the governor and
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
council process
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have a commissioner who's
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
liaison to the marine
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
advisory committee so really a lot of
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
our what in some respects makes the
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
commission and the department unique i
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
think is the extent to which we have
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
just a very large amount of opportunity
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
for public input through our monthly
 
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
for public input through our monthly
meetings

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
our committee meetings and then the
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
other interagency committees that we
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
participate in as commissioners
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to our our duties and our
 
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.750 align:start position:0%
with respect to our our duties and our
roles

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
roles
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
if you were to look through the fish and
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
game statute
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
virtually entire statute and one way or
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
the other defines what we do as a
 
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
the other defines what we do as a
commission

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
but really i'd focus on
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
206 4a which is the most
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
general statement of our duties and and
 
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
general statement of our duties and and
um

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
those really aren't i think all of us
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
take to heart
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that our duties are to be
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
stewards for our state's
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife and lands be represent
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
citizens representatives on these issues
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
and also to set general policy
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
for the department and then in with
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
general policy the statute goes on to
 
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
general policy the statute goes on to
define

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh four more specific elements and those
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
are the conservation and protection
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
management of our wildlife populations
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
and habitats
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
where our duties include the development
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
funding and implementation of a
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
long-range strategic plan
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
the acquisition development and
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance of public access
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
to our lands and waters public education
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the building of
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
support among the public for our our
 
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
support among the public for our our
efforts

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then we also establish policy
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
positions on
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
legislative issues that come before your
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
committee in the legislature that affect
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
our fish wildlife and marine resources
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
and the overall management of the
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
department and i'm often asked you know
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
duties of the commission are really well
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
articulated in the statute
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
but constituents often ask how we make
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
our decisions and the commission's done
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of work developing what i
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
call a decision
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
making matrix within which our we
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
consider all the issues that come before
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
us and
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
and those really are encompass
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
five different elements uh we consider
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
the biological impacts and of a
 
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.990 align:start position:0%
the biological impacts and of a
recommendation

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
we consider the financial implications
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
and constraints
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
of proposal or policy the legal
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
considerations and their ramifications
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
the technical feasibility
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
is an important element there are a lot
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
of great ideas but
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
being certain that we can technically
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish them is important and then
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
another great consideration in our work
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
is the social and political aspects of
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
it we
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
we need to take seriously the part of
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
our duties that call on us to build
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
public support and
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
acceptance for what the department's
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
doing um
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
we also have a rulemaking role
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is varied there are 20 some
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
sub-sections to the department's rules
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
and and really
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh if you were to narrow in on where the
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
commission has the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
largest role it's in the the wildlife
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
seasons fishing licensure and education
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
rules that be 300 400 1100 and 1200 and
then

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
elements of the marine and
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
importation and possession rules also
 
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.390 align:start position:0%
importation and possession rules also
have

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
commission engagement uh we
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
frequently participate in the public
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
hearings that the department
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh conducts review public comment and
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
then uh of course at our meetings
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
deliberate on and either adopt or
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
consider rule proposals before it moves
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
on to the jail car
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
process part of our role is also
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the approval or consent for the
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
expenditure of certain funds
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
these are principally funds that are
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
derived through the licensing process we
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a wildlife

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
fund um i think probably being the
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
largest ones
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
we also uh accept and
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
um allocate uh at the
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
s at the um advisement of the staff
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
donations to the department i really
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the most
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinary aspects of the fish and
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
game department
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
we routinely see um dozens of
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%

to look at either financial transactions
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
or when the legislative budget
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
assistance sends over
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
a request for a performance audit from

the legislature
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then finally they are responsible to
 
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
and then finally they are responsible to
procure

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
all of the boats snowmobiles

department
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
so as you can see they provide a very
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
important back office support element to
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
all of the divisions of our department
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
from there i want to move on to our
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and lands divisions
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
it would probably surprise many of you
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
to know that the department manages
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
or owns more than 160 buildings
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%

interests
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
our facilities and lands division
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
works to complete the maintenance on all
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
properties as much as possible using our
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
own forces
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
but when necessary they have access to
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
specialty subcontractors and
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
professional engineering services
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
they do this with a very small staff
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
including the public works manager
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the public boat access program

and maintenance duty of this division
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
handles all of these ramps
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh that includes not only designing and
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
constructing those that may be new
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
but also keeping those that have been in
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
place for a period of years
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
maintained and in operation on the 160
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
buildings that we have
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
they do everything ranging from routine
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
light maintenance
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
all the way to full office renovations
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
and roof replacements
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
they design and plan also for energy use
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
management and conservation and the
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
operation of all of our facilities as
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
required by law
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
and then land management is done using a
 
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:22.870 align:start position:0%
and then land management is done using a
team

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
that involves representation from all of
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
our divisions
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
to try to determine the appropriate way
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
to manage and use
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
all of the lands that we have i wanted
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
to end
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the public affairs division
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
primarily because
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
we've spent these last few minutes
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
giving you a huge amount of information
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure is hard to retain and
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
hard to remember
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
so therefore what i want to do is is
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of the public affairs division to
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
say they're the people that operate our
 
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.589 align:start position:0%
say they're the people that operate our
website

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
which is found at wildlife.state.nh.us
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
or you can find it using a state agency
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
link through the state website
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
and that's where you're going to find
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
more information about any of the issues
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about today
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
as well as many more but in the public
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%

00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh they also have an information unit
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
that is involved in marketing
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
promotion of all of our programs
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
including merchandising and advertising
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that provide public
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
information notices
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%

01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
you'll need to mute yourself
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
my internet's a little slow so
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
everything's delayed commissioner nice
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
nice to speak with you again could you
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
share with us what you think
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
your one pressing issue is for the
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
coming year or two
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the committee can be supportive to
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
um representative egan was asking what's
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
our one
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not one thing i've learned in the
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
last six months there's no such thing as
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
the one
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
pressing issue overall the one
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
issue that that impacts us almost in
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
everything we do
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
obviously is funding and budgeting um
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
anything we could do to change that is
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
that is certainly of interest to the
 
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
that is certainly of interest to the
department

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%

your
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
predecessor as director had um
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
put in a bill through the senate that
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
allowed him to be the
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
sole decider or the department to be the
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
sole decider of their rates and fees
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh at that time a lot of the rates and
 
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
uh at that time a lot of the rates and
fees

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
were raised um out of state not much as
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
in state
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any intention to evaluate
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
the current rates and fees being charged
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and look at parity
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
out of state hunting uh in new hampshire
 
01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:22.230 align:start position:0%
out of state hunting uh in new hampshire
with

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
argan at the moment versus the
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and um
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
address any of that since you're talking
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
um this year we are not that would be
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
something we'd probably be looking at in
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%

not hearing any not seeing anybody raise
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
their hands or try to get our attention
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
mr again may i recommend that since we

are running ahead of schedule
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
that we take a five-minute break mostly
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
because i cannot type and go to the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
restroom at the same time
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
sure we'll take a quick five-minute bio
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
break guys getting
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
run off and take care of things we'll be

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%

he has representative voxel
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
representative harvey is missing
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
although she has a nice lamp it looks
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
like i think that's what that is
 
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.749 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
all right so jump back in um
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
um i just want to talk about
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
bills public hearings work sessions
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and if you need
 
01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and if you need
caucuses

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll do a little quick
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
introduction members for people
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
especially our freshmen the legislature
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
and mutual legislature
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
hear from them and introduce everybody
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
around let's jump into the discussion
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
about the committee moving forward and
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
what things will look like
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
um so far we've only been assigned six
 
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
um so far we've only been assigned six
bills

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
which means we'll have a pretty quick
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
day a pretty quick um
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
legislative session as it relates to the
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
um we've been asked uh to have uh full
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee days
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
so starting at 9am and going through
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
um five o'clock um to try to heal the
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
bills and get them
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
through so that we're not um wasting
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
and putting putting bills off longer to
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
be hurt if we get them in
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
quicker and through this session um
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things we will be doing is um
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
i i had to try to do what's somebody's
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement they call it a cattle
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
called a court which allows me to
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
schedule all meetings at
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
km and then take them up as they come up
 
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
km and then take them up as they come up
um

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
in an effort to be efficient because i'm
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure as uh the returning members know
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes you
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
schedule a kitty hearing for a half hour
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it takes five minutes
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes you schedule a midi hearing
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a half hour and it takes three hours
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
um and so an effort to try to
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
accommodate some of that and not
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
dead time or where uh a 30-minute block
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
um 10-minute hearing um
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
i wanted to put up all 10 o'clock but
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
leadership is to know i'm not allowed to
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll be scheduling all the bills
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
about in about 15 minutes the 20 uh 30
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
minute increments
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can short that window and
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
as built with some may be running late
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
bills take longer and some will come up
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as the clock ticks but we're
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce the amount of dead time
 
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.149 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce the amount of dead time
or

01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
dead air time in the committee where
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
just clock date a certain number so we
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
can start up a um
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
session or a public hearing so we're
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
going to try and reduce that so we don't
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
have as much waiting around time it can
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
be efficient
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
um but we have six bills in in
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
in uh currently assigned when i spoke to
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
leadership last night this
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
thing's office they still had four bills
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
left to withstand the committees at that
 
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
left to withstand the committees at that
point

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know if any of those are
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game we may pick up a couple
 
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.470 align:start position:0%
fishing game we may pick up a couple
letters

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
letters
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
oh in the senate i believe only two or
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
three bills so
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
from march we should all expect a couple
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
bills coming over from the set
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
um so we should have a pretty short
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um section uh my guess is we'll have
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
possibly just one day of public hearing
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then in the morning we'll we'll pick
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
another day and do a morning of work
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
session and just run through the bills
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
our any amendments any changes we can
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
have that all lined up
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
and then use the break between the work
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
session and the executive session in the
 
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
session and the executive session in the
afternoon

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
to get any amendments written i
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand ols is going to have a new
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
process for amendments
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
um so as we move from the public section
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the work session actually i'm going
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
to go back to the public hearing as
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking the public hearing
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
um all it'll be a hybrid model so
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
members can either attend by video or
 
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
members can either attend by video or
attend

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
attend
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
in the room all of the room
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
sanitizing equipment has been delivered
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
to the state house
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
so we have new devices that will be in
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
each committee room
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
that will circulate the year five times
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
every hour which is significantly
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
greater than what the cdc recommends
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
for interior room like that um
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
the cdc requirement is two to two and a
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
half times so we'll be doing five
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
nearly or double um
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
so that uh so so if people want to
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
attend anderson they'll be welcome to
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
attend in person the rooms
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
they'll be my understanding will be
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
doubled in south so conditions will
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
be opening up and open up the doors and
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
people will be socially distancing just
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
out as far as it will be
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and again we'll have seating set up
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
but if you want to push
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
further i'll have no objection to that
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
um if you want to attend otherwise
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to attend the public
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
hearing by
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh remote and that's acceptable as well
 
01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:03.110 align:start position:0%
uh remote and that's acceptable as well
um

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
if you happen to be in the ob um
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
for your um this is more about
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
representatives who have bills and other
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
committees if you're in the lob your
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
bill is going to be heard in another
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
committee you'll be allowed to testify
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
in person as a representative because
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're in the building
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
if you're a member of the public public
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
will be testifying remotely
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
um and there'll be no public access to
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
the building
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
the one exception to that rule will be
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
if we have uh if or paul sanderson the
 
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
if we have uh if or paul sanderson the
legislative

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
gentleman and colonel jordan as a lead
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
of those department heads
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
um if they're in the building they're
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to be allowed to testify in person
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
especially if they've gotten up there
 
01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
especially if they've gotten up there
for

01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
six bills who are hearing six bills and
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
testifying all six of them they'll be
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to present in person as well
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
um moving it over into more sessions
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
again mls is going to put on
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
um they're going to have a slightly
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
different process for uh uh
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendments uh bills so if we go into
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
work session into the work session we
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
find the bill has met but it needs a
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
couple of technical corrections
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
mechanical corrections
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh or or just a a change to it
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can email right in the committee room
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment over ols
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
they will process it and then have
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
somebody hand deliver the amendment back
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
to us in our committee room for
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
for the um executive session let's go
 
01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:30.149 align:start position:0%
for the um executive session let's go
again

01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative flame has his hand
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
yep let me let me just run through it
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
all then i'll open up a discussion
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
um i just want to run through the the
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
list of more sessions executive sessions
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
um but my goal would be i think with six
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
bills to do a work session in the
 
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
bills to do a work session in the
morning

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
work through any issues um unless we
 
01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:48.390 align:start position:0%
work through any issues um unless we
decide

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
when we're in public hearing that it
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
needs a subcommittee and then we'll
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
assign a subcommittee
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
but um right now it looks like we're
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
we'll just go into work sessions in the
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
morning uh for one day
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then that afternoon we'll do the um
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
executive sessions for those bills or it
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
looks like maybe two days
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
of agile testimony or actual
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
legislative when the committee um if we
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
caucuses any time
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
um you know either in the work session
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
or in the uh
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
executive session the um you're welcome
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
to call it
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
we can just do like we just did a
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
five-minute reset so we're gonna turn
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
their cameras off and you can arrange a
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
as a caucusly a different way of uh
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
handling that caucus whether it be a
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
private zoo
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
meeting or a phone call or whatever you
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to manage
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
as a party as a party issue
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
um other than that uh i will
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
so jim representative explain who wasn't
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%

your head thank you and uh good
afternoon

01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
you're very loud uh representative lang
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
but for some reason
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'm missing some of the things
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
my question is um testifying in person
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
as a representative is that on bills
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that you are a sponsor of or is that on
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
any bill you want to testify on
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
i was unsure about that or is it just
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
bills that you are sponsoring
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
ask a clarifying question on that with
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
with leadership but the answer they gave
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the statement they made me made was that
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
if you're in the building and need to
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
testify on a bill you'll be able to
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
testify in person
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i i i presume that meant if you were
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
a sponsor co-sponsor but it's also kind
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
of awkward to be sitting in the fish and
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
game committee
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
room and and for whatever reason and
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
having to testify by remote into another
 
01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.229 align:start position:0%
having to testify by remote into another
office

01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's going on so um i i will bring
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
that to leadership
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
and when we come back for our first
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
meeting or i'll email the committee the
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i may have more questions
 
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
thank you i may have more questions
later

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
the next person goes mr chair
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative shirtless is raising his
 
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
representative shirtless is raising his
hand

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
you had representative shirtless thank
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
i had a question asking you the other
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
day from the new hampshire autobahn
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to know if the blue slips
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
so we're still working on a solution for
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
blue sheets and pink cards
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
do said it has come up with a model and
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
i it's going to be reviewed tomorrow i
 
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.229 align:start position:0%
i it's going to be reviewed tomorrow i
think

01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
precision on how they're managing their
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
senate hearings but yes we will have
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
a cheat the equivalent of the blue sheet
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
and call the pink card
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions in general about uh
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
bills public hearings work students
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i can't be the only person
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
with questions
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
i i i have the distinct
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
feeling from speaking to other people
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
house leadership has given a lot of
 
01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.229 align:start position:0%
house leadership has given a lot of
gratitude

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
gratitude
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee chairman to run the
 
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
to the committee chairman to run the
committees

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
in the way that they see fit and i think
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
um will you be requiring
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
representatives at the in person
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the committee hearings and committee
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
meetings to have a face covering
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
so the last again the last thing i heard
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
on this topic was that if you're up
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a similar to a
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant approach if you're up and
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
moving around you're going to be
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
required to have a face mask on if
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in your seat and you're
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
socially distancing you can take your
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay and i guess since nobody else
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
has any questions um
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%

01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:21.350 align:start position:0%

i will speak to um commissioner mason
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
but the reality is i think
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
almost all the information they gave us
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
is on their website
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh it was just organizational and fish
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
about them which
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
are and who i'll ask him for the uh
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
summary presentation and see if he can
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
submit that to the rest of the
 
01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.390 align:start position:0%

commission

01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh representative khan is back
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
as a question awesome
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
nope you've muted yourself again yeah
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
there you go in order
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative khan you just re-muted
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
again i don't know why your system keeps
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
muting itself
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
you seem to be having audio trouble
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
because you're still muted and every
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
time you've unmuted it's gone back
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
is this something that could be
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
submitted by an email
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
come back i'll reach out to him after
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
the meeting and and see what his
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
question was
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
anything else for um any questions
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
so does it take away going to find out
 
01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:08.709 align:start position:0%
so does it take away going to find out
about

01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors versus just someone wants to
 
01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:11.990 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors versus just someone wants to
testify

01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the building already so you have to
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
be in there for a purpose you can't just
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
show up to justify you have to be in for
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
another reason

01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
a second term on fish and game i enjoyed
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
it very much last year
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to working with all
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
of those who are returning
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
and getting to know the newcomers to the
 
01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
and getting to know the newcomers to the
committee

01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
i've spent a lifetime outdoors uh i
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
enjoy fishing
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
i theoretically hunt until it
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
comes time to get up and go and then i'm
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
like ron white it's really cold it's
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
really early and i don't want to go
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
but and i'm afraid i would actually uh
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
catch a deer and then i would have to
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
process it and that's a lot of work
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
so uh i don't have
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
any ohrv's at the moment although i look
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
joining in that sport sometime in the
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
coming years assuming i ever have time
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
being semi-retired keeps me busier than
 
01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
being semi-retired keeps me busier than
ever

01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%

third term i've served
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means committee for two
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%

served on job car in my this is my third
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
time on that committee as well
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
um i live in the lakes region i
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
service the towns of tilton and
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
sanderton up here at exit 20.
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
you hear me reference exit 20 because i
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
was originally born in new jersey and
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
everything is
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
relative to an exit number um so uh
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm off of exit 20 there i've lived
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire over
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
38 years now so more than half my life
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
is spent here in this state
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
we moved to the state because i grew up
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
as jim mentioned bear brook state park
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
when i was a kid and we lived in new
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
jersey every weekend we would come up to
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
bear brook and camp
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it got to the point where as soon as
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
i was out of school we'd come up and
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
i was out of school we'd come up and
camp

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
camp
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
and my dad would go home on sundays and
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
leave my mom and the rest of us
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
nine kids up at bear brook state park to
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
spend the entire summer
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
at bear brook state park and he would
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
come up every weekend to visit with us
 
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
come up every weekend to visit with us
so

01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
i've come to enjoy the outdoors a lot i
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
hunt i fish although i don't think i've
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
shot and i shot a deer in a long time
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
jim's gonna have to probably help me
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
with that one
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh i go out on a regular basis
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
with my children i have four kids
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
um they range in ages from 26 to 17.
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
and we still go out and fish out on a
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
boat and
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%

i will just remind committee members um
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to make an executive
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
make sure you get to your party
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
leadership and let them know
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
so they're going to sign a replacement
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
for executive session
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
