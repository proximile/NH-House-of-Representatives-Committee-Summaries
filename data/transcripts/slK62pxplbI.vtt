scheduled for May 9th and May 16th
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
I anticipate that today we will
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
go to noon
 
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.180 align:start position:0%
conclude the meeting at that time
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting was formed at the behest of
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee was formed at the
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
behest of our election law committee
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.180 align:start position:0%
and chairman Ross Berry
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the same action I was appointed as
 
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.430 align:start position:0%
and the same action I was appointed as
chairman

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh this will understand I see my role as
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
chairman as uh facilitating
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
communication among the members
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
to that effect
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
we can start out a bit informally with a
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
small group like this but a basic
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
requirement is that one person at a time
 
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.370 align:start position:0%
requirement is that one person at a time
speak

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're more comfortable
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
with the with the protocol that people
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
signal with his eye to speak and the
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
chairman then recognizes them but you're
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that the usual
 
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.350 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that the usual
procedure

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
or do you think that's too formal for a
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
meeting of this size
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
okay good the discretion of the chair
 
00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.230 align:start position:0%
okay good the discretion of the chair
excellent

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
alrighty so uh
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
I see the purpose of this meeting I'm
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to quote from a bill that was
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
introduced by representative Lane who's
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee but not yet
 
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.650 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee but not yet
here

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.690 align:start position:0%
here
uh

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
review and make specific recommendations
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
on the following items
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
existing campaign Finance laws and any
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that may exist therein
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
determining whether State campaign
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
Finance laws differ from current federal
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
making legislative recommendations to
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
streamline and improve the current
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
process in an effort to balance
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
transparency and Reporting requirements
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
for both candidates and political
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
committees right
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
I like that last
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
objective particularly uh it recognizes
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
the need for a balance
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
between transparency and the burden that
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements can impose on
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
both the public and candidates
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
and with that uh we're open to
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
discussion I am going to facilitate as I
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
see my job here by asking representative
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
Berry if you'd like to open the
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
discussion with some thoughts
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly interested in
 
00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.180 align:start position:0%
in hearing
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
my background's in engineering and
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
Science and we like to start at the top
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
with a concept and work down to
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
specifics so I'd be interested in
 
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.550 align:start position:0%
specifics so I'd be interested in
hearing

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh what people's thoughts are regarding
 
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.389 align:start position:0%
uh what people's thoughts are regarding
the

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
the ultimate purpose of campaign fine
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system and
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
what basic requirements it needs to
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
fulfill or what a success criteria are
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
so with that representative bear if
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to share some thoughts with
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
us I'd like to hear them thank you
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
you gotta the one on the right the one
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
on the left mutes everybody I found that
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
one out I I like to use that and
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative mirrorhead a lot right in
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
the middle of his speech click no
 
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.410 align:start position:0%
the middle of his speech click no
um

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
yes it's totally a technical error
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so I would assume that the majority
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
of our time will be spent on RSA 664.
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
correct that's the one that covers
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws you know and
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's basically four sections
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
in RSA 664 so there's the kind of
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
general terms and restrictions that's in
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
let's call it the opening Salvo so
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's 664 one through eleven
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and then there's duties
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
um that's 12 and 13A and then political
 
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
um that's 12 and 13A and then political
advertising

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
um 14 through 17A and then enforcement
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
18 through 23. so you know just kind of
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward maybe we should consider
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
just going through those block by block
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
obviously some of them will be really
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
quick we should probably break section
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
one up
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
into multiple pieces would be my guess
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
to actually look at it and you know try
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
we can come to consensus on because
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
obviously the committee does handle
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance bills and we do vote on
 
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance bills and we do vote on
them

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um You Know Nothing Stops anybody here
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
from filing anything next year but I
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
think maybe we can use this subcommittee
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to find common ground
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
and compromise
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
um on the issue we won't I will tell you
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
right now we won't agree on everything
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure but that's okay
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of my thoughts is
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
just go through the
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
go through it section by section and
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
tighten it up and find ways we can agree
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe we just package it if we find
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the areas we agree just package it
 
00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:22.019 align:start position:0%
all into one big Bill
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
um that we would hopefully all six of us
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
would sign off on and then I'm sure the
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
respective sides would have their own
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
changes that they'd make on their own
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
and we'll uh
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you who else would like to
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
share their thoughts with US
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.730 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
um in a sense we I I think I can predict
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
where where where each party has
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
different priorities I think what will
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
really be profitable to discover is
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
where there's some overlap so that we
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I think often uh you know someone
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
introduces a bill and the other side
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
likes 40 of it and and the whole bill
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
goes down and the 40 that the two sides
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
overlap on is lost so if we can kind of
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh front load that I think that might be
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Ward you
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
have some thoughts you'd like to share
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay excellent we're already agreeing on
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think some things that we
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
could find some
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
um would be one and we may have slightly
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
different differences of exactly what
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
that means um but like one of the things
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
that is happening in the background
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
right now is the secretary of state is
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
office is overhauling the campaign
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
Finance online reporting system
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so I think this committee the
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is kind of formed at a
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
really nice time to
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
figure out what the secretary state's
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
office needs that we may need to change
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of help them move to that system
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and I do hold a this is my personal
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
opinion is I would like to see a
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy that got everyone
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
every single candidate pack Pao whatever
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
you want to call it onto the online
 
00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:35.290 align:start position:0%
you want to call it onto the online
system

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:35.300 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
eventually making it mandatory I
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that in two years because I
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
think you'd have people in the house
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
would Revolt but I do think a
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
a gradual phase-in of online mandatory
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
reporting would we probably agree to
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
something like that specifically because
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
I think there's things that probably
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
frustrate both sides right so we see Pax
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
or candidates will
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
they'll hand write these reports right
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're illegible even though it says it
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
has to be legible but that's in the eye
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the beholder
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
um they'll fax it in so then it's coming
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
in on you know 64-bit or whatever you
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
know so it's illegible to begin with and
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
then it comes through it's all pixelated
 
00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
then it comes through it's all pixelated
and

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
um you know also from an enforcement
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
standpoint of you it's hard that puts
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office having to
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell if somebody's
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
committed a violation because you can't
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
aggregate the data in any meaningful way
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
right there's no searchable system and
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
you could do it you can upload these
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
PDFs into you know OCR readers and like
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
there's ways to kind of like make it a
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
little faster but you know I I do think
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire's elections continue to
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
grow as they become more expensive and
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
that's an inevitable thing right so you
 
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
you have State Rep braces now that are
 
00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:01.070 align:start position:0%
you have State Rep braces now that are
um

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know State Rep braces now that are
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
are some of them are pushing ten
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and ten years ago that
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
would have been absolutely ludicrous so
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's an area that we could
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably explore we'd need a we would
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm I know we would need a phasing to
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
get the house to buy into that right if
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
we just said every house Canada will
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
report online
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but there's other games along that
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
that campaigns play right so they'll
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
hang outside the Secretary of State's
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
office on reporting day until 4 30 or 4
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
o'clock with their paper filing and then
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
they'll hand it to the office right
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
before the deadline and that way it
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't go up for another two days
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
because it takes the Secretary of
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
State's office time to scan it and put
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
it up and that's actually a even if we
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree on a mandatory phase in
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
of online reporting I something that I
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
would totally agree on is if you're
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
going to report in paper or PDF your
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
report needs to be in two days before
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
the online reporting system to give the
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office so that
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
they're all going online at the same
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
time because it's a
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's a structural
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
that there shouldn't be a
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
um structural penalty for not using for
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
for using the online system right like
 
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
it should be it's the only system that
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
we have now by the way it's relatively
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
easy to use it does have some quirks
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
um relatively easy to search
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
it needs to we need to be pushing people
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
towards it and especially these big
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
campaigns right I'm not I'm not overly
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
worried about somebody running for you
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
know County Commissioner who raised 750
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not worried about that person right
 
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:42.260 align:start position:0%
but these some of these political
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy Pac packs
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
political action committees some of
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
these things are pulling in a million
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and they're putting it up on
 
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.470 align:start position:0%
dollars and they're putting it up on
paper

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so anyways I think that's an area
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
that we could start with overlap I'd be
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
happy to hear if you guys think you have
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know some areas to overlap um I'm
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
definitely open to ideas and I don't
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
want to monopolize this so I'm going to
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
that seems persuasive I I don't see I
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
mean when you know in principle uh
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
mandatory use the online system seems
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
right you know you just don't want to
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
penalize a low resource candidate who
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
um computer savvy or maybe doesn't have
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
a connection at their house
 
00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:29.299 align:start position:0%
um you know you don't want to make it
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
effectively impossible for them to
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
comply so you want to have some sort of
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
option for people to make it possible
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
for ordinary citizens to serve but in
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
um well something like that to
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead's Point you'd
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
put in a floor or a floor right you'd
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
say so anybody the first thing is is I I
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
really think you have to have a phase in
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
next election every candidate for
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
governor every candidate for every Pac
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
has to go online right if you're if
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
you're Savvy enough to form a political
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
action committee in the state of New
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saving up to figure out the
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
online system right so let's just like
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
start there right and then in two years
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
you could tack in you know executive
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
Council races State Senate races right
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
and then in three years and three Cycles
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
I should say you could tack in you know
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
State reps and everyone else who raises
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
over some number a thousand dollars
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
right because if you're Savvy enough to
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
raise a thousand dollars or you're
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
saving up to spend a thousand dollars
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so you could just make it the
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
current threshold right
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
right now it's about spending not
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
raising so if you spend your own money
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
you still have to report it used to be
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
spend or raise but I do know it changed
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
right now it's just raising now six
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures right I thought it was both
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong I mean because if
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're I mean if you're raising it
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
you're spending it but
 
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
you're spending it but
664.7

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
664.7
 
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.630 align:start position:0%
664.7
yep

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
by the way it's another thing to look at
 
00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.149 align:start position:0%
by the way it's another thing to look at
is

00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
maybe we should turn signs and you're
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
over a thousand yeah well how much
 
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:17.900 align:start position:0%
you're paying for signs dude Jesus
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my guy
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I mean that's another area that we
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
could look at is I I really do think it
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
should be raised or spent
 
00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:26.750 align:start position:0%
should be raised or spent
um

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
because if somebody gives the the point
 
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
of this campaign Finance laws part of it
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that nobody's you know
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
getting undue influence right or who is
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
influencing who right so if somebody
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
gives you you know a hundred thousand
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollars but you don't have to report it
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
because you didn't spend any of it
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes my recollection that it is raised or
 
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:48.020 align:start position:0%
spent it used receipts and expenditures
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
I believe it used to be it may have been
 
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.770 align:start position:0%
I believe it used to be it may have been
changed

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it says um
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative Ward is correct it says
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
whose expenditure is exceeding a
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean there's an easy
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh 664 seven
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
um another thing and just I'm just
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
throwing this out not tangentially but
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
while it's on my brain um another thing
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at is
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
how local parties
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
report and what classification they are
 
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
report and what classification they are
given

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
um because I think there's
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
they kind of exist almost in a no man's
 
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
they kind of exist almost in a no man's
land

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
so your town committees your county
 
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.890 align:start position:0%
so your town committees your county
committees

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have an apparatus for State parties
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
but we need to kind of figure out
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
where to put these some of these local
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
organizations because I think right now
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
most of them file under packs but
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
um they're not a Pac but they should be
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
treated more like a party because they
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
are a party are they not
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
see what I'm saying yeah
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
a political Committee of a party like a
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
town committee yeah does not have to
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
register as such it runs of the umbrella
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the state party is how I would look
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
at it however if they again this is this
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
is from memory we'll have to check the
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
actual statute but
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that if you raise or
 
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.210 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that if you raise or
spend

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand then you have to
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
report that that's the threshold for
 
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.690 align:start position:0%
report that that's the threshold for
reporting

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
and naturally if you hit that threshold
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have to register as in as
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
an entity also
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
as a chairman of a local committee I
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
have looked at that in to make sure I
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
was on the right side of things and
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
actually had a discussion with the
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
yeah but you can see how there could be
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
confusion excuse me you could see how
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
there could be confusion oh yeah
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
so that's something that I think we
 
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.870 align:start position:0%
so that's something that I think we
could

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
that's really in the weed sort of stuff
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
but it's something that does kind of
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed also by the way
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's a weight of
 
00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:50.779 align:start position:0%
like do we consider that as a way around
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
contribution limits right so somebody
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
you know there's 235 towns in the state
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right or something
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
something along those lines you know if
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
each of them had a town committee and
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
each of them had a ten thousand ten
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
thousand ten thousand a donor could go
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
around and give 30k 30k 234 235 times
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then package that all up and
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
transfer it up and I mean it's it's not
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
a possible problem to solve but it's a
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
again I always try to draw a distinction
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
between what I really understand and
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
what I only think I understand
 
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.590 align:start position:0%
what I only think I understand
yeah

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
uh it's my understanding that as as a
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
candidate if you've exceeded the
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
threshold for reporting
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
you have to report all receipts
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh anything under uh
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
50 or under you don't have to report the
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
specifics but I don't think we're
 
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
concerned about 50 amounts particularly
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
but if you got a large donation from
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
a county committee or a local committee
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh once you're reporting you've got to
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
report it yeah once you're reporting we
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
have to report it so it is in the system
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's another thing I want to look at by
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
the way the the getting the employer
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
occupation and address of employer
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
is is onerous just so everybody knows
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's I believe that we have to do that
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
after 200 it's now 200. um that is
 
00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.169 align:start position:0%
after 200 it's now 200. um that is
onerous

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
onerous
 
00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:13.010 align:start position:0%
onerous
um

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not a hide who they're
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
working for right but you're already
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
collecting their name their address
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a very common
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
source of violations
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
um so something I'd like the committee
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
to look at is you end up with these
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
reports well they'll say you know
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
information requested and then they
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
never go back and and
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
find it
 
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.250 align:start position:0%
find it
um

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
and I just I just wondered what level
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's necessary and we may have
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
disagreements on that but I just have
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
one to what level is that a straight
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
thought listening to you is that the a
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
G was it the AG who reported to us
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
earlier in in the full committee that
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of reps who are in
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
violation and are going to be receiving
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
letters or have received letters I think
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
it was our deputy secretary of state who
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
told no it wasn't you okay so then
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
you're right it had to be it might be
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
interesting for this committee to get
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
some information on what is causing all
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
these five what has caused all these
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
violations and for us to just talk about
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
which which of these common violations
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
um we regard as you know serious and
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
really errors on behalf of the
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
candidates and which of them we we might
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
think are a consequence of reporting
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
requirements that that aren't serving
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
the balance of transparency and
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
efficiency I I do remember the the
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
individuals spoke to us
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
indicated there were quite a few that
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
they had to follow up on and send
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
letters about yeah they sent these
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
letters out that said hey um you know if
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
you do this in the future it's a 50 a
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
day fine
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I I do remember a representative
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
sitting on one side or the other of me
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
in that meeting expressing concern that
 
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
laughs my goodness gracious how dare you
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and by the way going back to the online
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
system and that's something that would
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
make their life a little easier right is
 
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's easier to find
 
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.409 align:start position:0%
it's easier to find
um

00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's easier to find violations when you
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
can run searches instead of having to
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
manually pull through reports
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I think the big one in was a lot of
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
people Miss deadlines
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
um so like like you know I I know that I
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
had to submit a report and I was I had
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
to submit six and I got to my own I do
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
my own last I guess uh and I you know
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I submitted it after midnight and I
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
was in violation because I was after
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
midnight you know um I know another
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
instance of that sort of thing happening
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
too it it happens I mean it's just you
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
know because you have it's not that you
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't have too much time it's that
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's nothing that we should look at is I
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
I believe is is how these reports are
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
spaced out right so it's like six months
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
six months six months
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
one month two weeks two weeks you know
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
it's just so that first
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
those those six months there's a lot
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
happens in especially in that last six
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
months period you actually the
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
the organization start taking some
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
serious cash and so that that probably
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
creates some headaches as you get this
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
last minute you get this six-month
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
report that's due and it's actually
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
rather large
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and I know the feds the feds do it
 
00:30:24.899 --> 00:30:26.750 align:start position:0%
um and I know the feds the feds do it
quarterly

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I actually don't hate how the feds Do
 
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.810 align:start position:0%
um I actually don't hate how the feds Do
It

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
It
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of reporting requirements
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
their their schedule
 
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.450 align:start position:0%
their their schedule
um

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
but they have you know they kind of have
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
some moving there's this bass drone you
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
know because it's different per state
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
for the feds they do it based on like
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
when the election's happening
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
um so but they do have quarterly
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
requirements and with the FEC you have
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
to file online I believe I don't believe
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
you can even file on paperwork
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
um the FEC system by the way is actually
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
like way worse to use than the New
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire system just if you're filing
 
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:00.059 align:start position:0%
on your own just an FYI it's like I've
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
used them both and the FEC system is
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
like way worse we all remember there's
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
another reporting deadline coming up in
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
May right uh I believe it's due June 5th
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
June I thought it was I think it's May
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
well I'm gonna I'm gonna be checking the
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
exact date myself before I know the six
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
months I know the six month number is
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
coming up yeah um
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
I know the six months coming up uh
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that I raised with
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office on their
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
online system is
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was this flaw this is not for this
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
committee to fix but there was this I
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to say flaw but there's this
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
bug where
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
if you tried to form you know you have a
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
certain I figured how long you have
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
after forming your committee to actually
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
file but basically like if you wanted to
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
to file the online the committee online
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
after the cut off but before the
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
reporting date you weren't able to do it
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I did raise that with the Secretary
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
of State's office
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so I hope they fixed that in the new
 
00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.269 align:start position:0%
um so I hope they fixed that in the new
system

00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
online system as well which I was told
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
it was a software problem and I don't
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
know that it's been fixed yet well
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to new system so um it's
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
definitely in all serious you should
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
raise that whatever your issue is they
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
seem very open to
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
um addressing those issues so I I would
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
raise it with them
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
um because they seemed very open to
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
fixing it but anyways that's not for
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
this committee that's that's for the
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
sos's office but
 
00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.169 align:start position:0%
sos's office but
um

00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
so do you have can consent can you must
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
elaborate on mandatory online reporting
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
other than me I mean I've kind of said
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
my kind of thought process on it which
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
is have a phase in and
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
that's where does anybody else have any
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
ideas or pontifications about that of
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
but why don't we
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
seek to get briefed by the Secretary of
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
State's office on the on the status of
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
any new you know system or changes and
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
think about how that you know maps on to
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
the current requirements and whether we
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
might need to you know specify in the
 
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
might need to you know specify in the
law

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
um something different in order to
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
gently push
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
candidates and committees
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh into the online reporting system over
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
so uh your suggestion is to seek a
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
briefing from the Secretary of State's
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
office on the on the current plan to
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
I see we have a representative of the
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
should I submit that via email or can I
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
ask you now to arrange such a briefing
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you can ask me right now and
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
tell me which day you would like it I
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
know you have a couple meetings
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
scheduled May 9th would be fine okay
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
would you say your name just for the
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
record oh uh I am Aaron Hennessey I am
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary of state thank you
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
that was fast
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
um another thing that I'd like to look
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
at is on the political advertising side
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
of it I'd like to look at the disclaimer
 
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
of it I'd like to look at the disclaimer
requirements

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
um we have we have varying disclaimer
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
requirements across various mediums
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
media if you will and I'd like to
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
streamline that
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
um one of the most common violations
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
that I see is on printed materials and
 
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
that I see is on printed materials and
or

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.329 align:start position:0%
or
um

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
candidates won't include
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
the address of the committee
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
the or the chairman and or Fiscal Agent
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
and I also question kind of what
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
why is that necessary
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
in in so much as you know the
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
information is available online I would
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
never not have the paid for on there but
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
when you start
 
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:07.940 align:start position:0%
specifically for things
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
online right so they'll cancel run these
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
little banner ads and in order to make
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
that Banner ad legible the disclaimer
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
legible the disclaimer would actually
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
take up like literally two-thirds of the
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
advertising space
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um because if you have to have all that
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
information on there so I'd like to find
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
ways to to streamline that
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
um another thing that that we need to
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
look at is political text messaging
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
so right now it exists in no man's land
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't under New Hampshire RSA
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
um the FCC considers a political a text
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
message a phone call
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
so very technically every political text
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
message sent in the state of New
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should end with this call has
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
been paid for by blah blah blah
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
um very technically if you if you read
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
it literally
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
um that's obviously not
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
feasible nor
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:05.060 align:start position:0%
rational but I do think there should be
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
disclaimer requirements as to
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
who is sending it
 
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
um but I think it needs to be
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
differentiated from a phone call which
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
is rather lengthy it's one thing at the
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
end of a phone call to say you know just
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
so you know this call has been paid for
 
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.089 align:start position:0%
so you know this call has been paid for
by

00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah for governor
 
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.050 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah for governor
um

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
but it's it's something that I think we
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
could look at
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
um because it does exist I mean and
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be the new thing
 
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be the new thing
in

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
advertising that we're going to have to
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
go and and put under an umbrella but
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
that one's kind of
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
hung quietly and it's they're getting
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
more and more aggressive
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
there are by the way carrier
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for those disclosures so
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
the carriers do self-regulate to a
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
certain extent
 
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.569 align:start position:0%
certain extent
um

00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
pretty aggressively I might add
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
but something to to look at but I would
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
I just I would love to get rid of the
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
you have to put the address
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
of the committee on the advertisement I
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
would just love to do away with that
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
entirely I think it's
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh I I like
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
I I just what is the value of me putting
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
401 Riverdale Avenue Manchester New
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 03103 on the bottom of all my
 
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:20.540 align:start position:0%
Palm cards
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
is that going to change anybody's
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
opinion on me
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
so it's just something that I'd like to
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
throw out there of I I think there's
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think there's ways to to streamline it
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
actually hurt transparency
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
right like if it says paid for by Berry
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
foreign h
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
and you go and you onto the campaign
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
Finance system and you type in Berry
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
foreign H and Berry foreign H brings up
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
Ross Berry 401 Riverdale Avenue
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire 603 803-3448
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.970 align:start position:0%
you know
um

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
in the Fiscal Agent the treasurer
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
do they really need the address
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
do they really need to know that I'm My
 
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
do they really need to know that I'm My
Own

00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
Own
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
not like a it's not like a we must do
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
this it's just a question physical
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
addresses in
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
in in in all commercial life has
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
radically transformed if you go to you
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
know used to go to a company and you'd
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
know you want to know where is it
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
located most websites have no addresses
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
on them now most of them also have no
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
phone numbers and so what it means to be
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
able to you know follow someone or a
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
committee or an envy and locate it
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
locate the accountable person that's
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
different today than it used to be I
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
mean you could use a PO address a PO Box
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
I mean what does that what does that
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
tell you you know if it's
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
so and so campaign PO Box you know blah
 
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.690 align:start position:0%
so and so campaign PO Box you know blah
blah

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
blah
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
what did you what did you gather from
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.569 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah signature identification lack of
 
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.050 align:start position:0%
yeah signature identification lack of
authorization

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
um but I I mean in an Ideal World in an
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
ideal world it would be Universal across
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
all mediums right that may not be
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
entirely feasible
 
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
entirely feasible
but

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I I I just go back to it I feel that
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
there's a way to
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
I feel that there's a way to
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
more uniform
 
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.810 align:start position:0%
more uniform
without

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing the ability to know
 
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.290 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing the ability to know
who's

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
producing the advertisement correct I
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
have a question related to that that one
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
of you guys might have a more insight on
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
that has to do with uh political signs
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
say where this should be identification
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
how would we enforce that against an
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
out-of-state entity I don't not I'm not
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
aware that New Hampshire law extends to
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or California doesn't
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
extend outside the state as far as I
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
know well is it anything about a federal
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
race or uh I'm talking about I'm talking
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
a local state race I mean local state
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
races uh I would assume that we could
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
prosecute them because they're violating
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law right and they're
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're somebody's doing something in
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is illegal right so
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's um I I would assume we would
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
be able to pull them into court and grab
 
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:23.150 align:start position:0%
be able to pull them into court and grab
them

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
um you know you're never you're never
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to get everybody one of the things
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
that always drives me nuts
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
and it's like maybe I'm grabbing the
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
third rail is where these yard signs are
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to be placed in public it like
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
really drives me up a wall
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
that signs go in public places I I know
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
I hold an unpopular opinion there but I
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
as somebody who works very hard to put
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
their yard signs in actual physical
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
yards it's very it's very upsetting to
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
me when my hard work is undone by
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
somebody who you know two days for the
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
election goes and blasts some median
 
00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.550 align:start position:0%
election goes and blasts some median
somewhere

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
um and they never get picked up and
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that we should look
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
at is you know actually punishing people
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
for not picking up their signs
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if a campaign
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
I see both sides of the argument there
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
right it's like if somebody takes my
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
sign and puts it somewhere where I
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
didn't know but like ultimately like you
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't been given that sign out like
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
if you give somebody a hundred signs you
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
know they ain't going in yards like
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know so this is something that it's
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
a personal frustration of mine that well
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
give you an example of a type of public
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
place you're talking about because the
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
statutes explicitly allow people to put
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
their signs in the public right-of-way
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
with the permission of the underlying
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
property owner so can you give me an
 
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.250 align:start position:0%
property owner so can you give me an
example

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
I mean they won't even get I'll give
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
example of uh route 101 right you can go
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
and blast route 101 the property owner
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't even really know where
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
their line is on that line uh and it's
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
never going to be you know it's never
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
get picked up and then it's you know
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
these signs never get picked up and then
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking at them and you know I
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't know it's a huge pet peeve of mine
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that I hate when people don't pick them
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
up and I do we did have that good law
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
about that we that we had the good world
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
like people can go and pick them up from
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
the same party
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but it should almost be I mean one
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we could put in here
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
that I would really be in support of is
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
after so and so date you know any sign
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's on public property after the
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
election is fair again for anybody to
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
pick up like I would love that it
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
actually beat me to that yeah I mean a
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
month after the election any sign any
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
sign yeah any sign on not on private
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
property should be
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
able to be picked up by anybody correct
 
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.349 align:start position:0%
able to be picked up by anybody correct
yeah

00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
late yeah so it's all in 664. well I
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
don't know if picking up the signs is
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's what I'm saying well we
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
got on the tangent because we started
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
talking about the disclaimers and then I
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
because we we talked about we're
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
basically going to look at all of 664.
 
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.329 align:start position:0%
basically going to look at all of 664.
yeah

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
yep there it is see it is directly
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
relevant I knew I I knew I was right not
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
really but I got really lucky so
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
well I I do think it's related to
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance because it's dealing
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
with a consequence of people spending
 
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.510 align:start position:0%
with a consequence of people spending
money

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
I did introduce this uh this meeting
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Lane by quoting from by
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
quoting from uh the bill which you had
 
00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:42.530 align:start position:0%
quoting from uh the bill which you had
submitted

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
and uh quoted liberally from it in terms
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
of our basic objective starting with uh
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
exist uh
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
review and make specific recommendations
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
on the following items existing campaign
 
00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
no no apology necessary we all
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand the existence existencies of
 
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
do you have some thoughts you'd like to
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we talked about
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
um probably the only part you missed was
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
we talked about looking at
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of rollout for mandatory
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
online reporting
 
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.089 align:start position:0%
online reporting
yes

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and yeah kind of
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
ways to ways to get people there that
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
won't freak people out
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
right I I spoke with um secretary
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
Scanlon actually about that and so have
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
hit them maybe come in and talk to us
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're coming at the next meeting
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and we did talk about a little bit
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
there as you know they're overhauling
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
the current online system and making
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
asking them if they need us to change
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
anything that would make that process
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
easier for them
 
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.930 align:start position:0%
easier for them
um

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
slightly different topic there's been
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
concern over the last
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
four years or so about the possibility
 
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
four years or so about the possibility
that

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
LLCs can serve to obfuscate the identity
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
of of donors to campaigns and committees
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.130 align:start position:0%
of of donors to campaigns and committees
um

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and and so I'm curious is there do
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
you think that there is overlapping
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
concern between members of the two
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
parties about what's sometimes called
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
the LLC loophole
 
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.809 align:start position:0%
the LLC loophole
um

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm more concerned about
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the pack loophole before I would touch
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
the quote LLC loophole
 
00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:00.170 align:start position:0%
the quote LLC loophole
so

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
um the pack loophole being if some Mega
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
donor wants to give five million dollars
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to some federal pack
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
that Federal Pac can then transfer
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
unlimited to the state pack which can
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
then transfer unlimited to a state party
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
which is then allowed to coordinate with
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
the candidate
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.970 align:start position:0%
the candidate
so

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
before we go not not to take this place
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
to this subcommittee to a negative place
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
but before we go after the llc's let's I
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
I would not entertain
 
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.170 align:start position:0%
I would not entertain
um

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to be able to negative
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is truly how I feel
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
I do not want to entertain curtailing
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's small businesses
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
while The Floodgate
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
the small are we doing raising
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's more of a
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's working to jump on top of each
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
other okay this is a work session it was
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
posted as such and I just want to make
 
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:08.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's the small
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that we're going to be really
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
affecting it's the people who
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
intentionally set these up to do it to
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
get around the loophole I don't think
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's small businesses because those and
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
if those small businesses want to give
 
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.170 align:start position:0%
if those small businesses want to give
money

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
then they can but they're going to still
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
be limited by the individual limit but
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
which is for each race I don't remember
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
what we're up to but I don't think
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
they're mutually exclusive and I I guess
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to see them be treated
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
or let's put it just in a factual you
 
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
know proposition are there loopholes
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
that allow entities to escape the
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
requirement of transparency pack
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
loopholes other loopholes we might
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
disagree about whether such and such a
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
thing is is a you know functions as a
 
00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.630 align:start position:0%
thing is is a you know functions as a
loophole

00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
but um but let maybe just introduce that
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
question and then do some factual
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
examination to see if we can agree on
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
certain cases Pacs or others that there
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
are that there are whether there are
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
loopholes the next question is that
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
there are does the cost of closing
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
loophole you know
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
exceed the benefit or and so we may or
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
may not agree that we should do
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
something about it depending on on how
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
elegant it is to close the loophole or
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
costly it is but but maybe if we could
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
just focus on whether there are such
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
loopholes that being you know
 
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.089 align:start position:0%
loopholes that being you know
Illuminating

00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:35.099 align:start position:0%
Illuminating
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
we should definitely put a day aside for
 
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.670 align:start position:0%
we should definitely put a day aside for
that

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.569 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we are going to have
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
um philosophical disagreements on there
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to find I think
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of overlap and I don't want to do
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
that let's put that at the end after
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
we've found what we can't agree on I
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
guess is what I would say before we um
 
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:02.660 align:start position:0%
but good for us because
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'll end my my opinion on on that this
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
subject with this I worked in campaigns
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
for many moons many many moons
 
00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
and I know
 
00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:16.190 align:start position:0%
and I know
that

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
just from practicality in many different
 
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.190 align:start position:0%
just from practicality in many different
states

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.690 align:start position:0%
states
that

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
the money always finds its way there
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
legally it always finds its way there
 
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.730 align:start position:0%
legally it always finds its way there
um

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
you can make arguments to me about it
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
should be 100 transparent but there's
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
just so many ways to get around the law
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
legally to get around the intention of
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
the law legally that and that's that's
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
been one of my historic oppositions to
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
the quote LLC loophole is I do disagree
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
with you I think a lot of small
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
businesses donate via their LLC one of
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
my small businesses donates with via
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
it's LLC
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
um I my issue with shutting them off
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's like my thing with them is why do
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
we always shut them off first when the
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's like you're you're trying to put a
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to block up the stream
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
while the river is running right over
 
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.130 align:start position:0%
while the river is running right over
there

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
um but that'll be I'll end it with that
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
but my one thing I would say is we
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
should do that last because we will have
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
those agreements I'm off for doing it
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
last I mean I think the you know
 
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.060 align:start position:0%
it's really it's really an open-minded
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
fact-finding spirit and not a
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
pre-judgment that such and such a thing
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
has to be shut off so there might be you
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
know like a question about whether
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements are appropriate
 
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:33.710 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements are appropriate
um

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the kind of thing it is uh and and I
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
personally have a very open mind
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
um about about the whole question so I
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
haven't prejudged what policy is
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary even anyway that
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
that would be the spirit of it I think
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
yes I I think it comes Under The Heading
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
of balancing transparency with burden on
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
candidates and campaigns
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
in general and I think a good first step
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
here would be actually to quantify the
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the issue how much money is
 
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.309 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the issue how much money is
involved

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
I think how
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
we we do have information I think from
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance systems that as it
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
exists I think we could derive
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
information on how many llc's donate
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
money correct
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
we could get a dollar amount can we I'm
 
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
not sure that well well we'll have to
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
find out because right now they're not
 
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.450 align:start position:0%
find out because right now they're not
required

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
LLC no so you get money yeah well yeah
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
when so when you donate via an LLC
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
um you you could say you know give you
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
know this is from you know X LLC
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the issue is finding out going back
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the mandatory online reporting the
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
issue with finding out how much which
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
llc's are being used like this is
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
difficult because you have paper filings
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you can't just start like it would
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
be really nice to be able to search you
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
know give me all contributions that end
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
in LLC right and then it populates it up
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
and you could see you know are there
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
um are there but it's not just llc's I
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
mean these are not non-profits can do
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
that any entity any legal entity can do
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
this or group of people can can do this
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
so it's it's we'll do it I want to do at
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
the end because but
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
But to answer your question to answer
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
that question is we wouldn't be able to
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
really tell without going through every
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
single campaign Finance report uh every
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
single contribution uh and typing them
 
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.069 align:start position:0%
single contribution uh and typing them
out

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
I mean the the data exists because the
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
candidates have to report receipts and
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
above 50 they have to report the source
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
of the receipt so that so the data
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
exists now is it how practical is it to
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
extract it but I I still think a good
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
first step
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
to discussing this would be to get some
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
data on it if it's a hundred thousand
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
dollar problem around what uh
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm looking to Define it
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
as a problem but if it's a hundred
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh level of
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh event
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
then maybe it's not a big worry
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide if it's 10 million then we
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
might want to look at it but we need to
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
what I call bound the problem how big a
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
problem is it and what would it take to
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
get the data to do that I don't know
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's worth looking into
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
I want to look into it and I think we
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
wait till the end and we'll get the data
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
Mr bear representative Berry I I just
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
turn on in case we started talking I
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
don't have anything okay um other than
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
just ideas you know
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
things that aren't you know well I think
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is a good a good purpose of first
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
meeting is to get ideas out there well I
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
I like to look at
 
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.690 align:start position:0%
I like to look at
um

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
under Section six
 
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.329 align:start position:0%
under Section six
two

00:54:01.329 --> 00:54:01.339 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh push pulling
 
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.569 align:start position:0%
uh push pulling
is

00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
only right now
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
um subject to telephone calls
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
and polling in general is moving towards
 
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.970 align:start position:0%
and polling in general is moving towards
mixed

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
mixed responses so some some of it is
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
still conducted by live person phone
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
calls very few in New Hampshire is
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
conducted by ivr which is the robocalls
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
pre-recorded messages
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of it is done text
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
messaging online so that's something
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
that needs to be tightened up if we're
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
going to stay within the spirit of a
 
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.849 align:start position:0%
going to stay within the spirit of a
push-pull

00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
push-pull
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
I've never seen that loophole abused
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
before just for the record but it's
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
always been one of those things of like
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
hmm if I was doing this this is how I
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
would do it
 
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.069 align:start position:0%
would do it
um

00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
so just something that I think we could
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
probably all agree on to tighten that up
 
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.690 align:start position:0%
probably all agree on to tighten that up
and

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.430 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah an easy thing to do that would be I
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
I've never liked the idea of like they
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
tell you how many calls you can do I
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
think it should be I think it should
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
like it should start off with like this
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
is a message test or something or this
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
is you know we are we are message
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
testing on behalf of a client you know
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
the following one we say is
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
you know opinion base or something like
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
that some sort of disclosure that would
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the because they have a
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
formula it's like if you're running for
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide presidential office you can
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
have no more than 2 000 connected phone
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
calls that last no more than two minutes
 
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:30.970 align:start position:0%
calls that last no more than two minutes
each

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
and by the way like I did have a
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
congressional race I worked for they
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
asked us we had a complaint filed
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
against us that we were conducting a
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
push-pull we weren't we had to produce
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
our script we had to produce our call
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
records so they do look into it it's not
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't happen
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
um but it should be uh
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
no it's it's state for congress no well
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
Federal but we we control Federal yeah
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
which would be another interesting thing
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
to see is like is that even
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
constitutional because what's I think
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
it's like bass versus State of New
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or no bass versus Gardner I
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
think was the court case
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
um but they did about uh pre-recorded
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
phone calls I don't know I'm getting
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
like way into the Weeds now but that is
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
a disclosure issue which is under
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.190 align:start position:0%
 
what's

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh it's the definitions
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so definitions defines it as uh oh
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah 17 and then I think there's an
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
actual section about push polling
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
um 16 identification of political
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
16a

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
a through D oh my goodness
 
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:51.049 align:start position:0%
a through D oh my goodness
um

00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
so it's a just another thing to tighten
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
up I would guess
 
00:56:56.339 --> 00:57:05.329 align:start position:0%
up I would guess
um

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
and you're concerned about push pulling
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
done by I mean most polling is sort of
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh web-based
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah mixed delivery yeah mixed delivery
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
is what I would say I mean a lot of it's
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
web they are moving that direction
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we don't need to get into the
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
intricacies of polling and waiting and
 
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
non-response bias
 
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um but it's our law I guess the the
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
underlying messages our laws are all
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
geared towards
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
phone calls and if we are going to stay
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
within the spirit of our law we would
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
need to adapt them towards modern
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
polling methods
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
um because you could in theory run an
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
online poll
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
that is a push pull
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
that would not actually meet the
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
um you know if I said you know
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead is well known
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
that Retros in a Meerhead hates puppies
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
and kittens does this make you more
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
likely less likely and I could run that
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know 50 000 times one of the goal
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
guys that's a it's a message testing uh
 
00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
when in reality is it's a push-pull
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
because it's our push-pull laws are
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
written around telephone calls just
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
saying if if it was to be violated
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
not that I'd be familiar with the
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
by the way you may get some calls from
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
just say heads up out there
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
it was not cheap
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes and I understood the context of the
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
remarks that they're basically no entity
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
or animal that representative mirrorhead
 
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
his favorite favorite animal is in fact
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
a skunk
 
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:49.730 align:start position:0%
a skunk
um

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
don't ask him why but
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
Jesus so I think there's stuff like that
 
00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:57.460 align:start position:0%
that we can tighten up
 
00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:57.770 align:start position:0%
that we can tighten up
[Music]

00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.730 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
and then another thing that I would like
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
um is when we did pass campaign Finance
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
reform two years ago
 
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.170 align:start position:0%
reform two years ago
um

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
it was I know it was the intention of
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
this body to get rid of the pre-filing
 
00:59:13.559 --> 00:59:18.349 align:start position:0%
this body to get rid of the pre-filing
period

00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
um and the AG world that it still exists
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
so if you recall from the conversations
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
right the total overall contribution
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
limit for a candidate was seven thousand
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
dollars it was five thousand one and one
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
right and we took it and made it five
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
thousand and five thousand so we took it
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
from basically seven thousand dollars we
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
probably we were taking it from seven
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and we inadvertently took it from
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars to fifteen
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that I would
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
extend as an olive branch when we get to
 
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.990 align:start position:0%
extend as an olive branch when we get to
um

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
that subject is putting it back in line
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
with what the legislators legislate
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
chores intent was
 
00:59:57.599 --> 00:59:58.250 align:start position:0%
chores intent was
um

00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
because a a doubling would have been a
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.930 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
Ross do you remember the build number we
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
did that with no I believe it was this
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
billed as the uh Sweeney Alexander Berry
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
campaign financial support package so
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
you can probably Google that prop up
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of coverage Lots
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
yeah it was it was a real barn burner
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%
um but I don't it just really upset me
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
that they were like no you didn't get
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
rid of pre-filing and I was like no we
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
we like explicitly got rid of it like
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
but probably something to fix before
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
and then we'd have to deal with
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
obviously if we kicked it into this
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
current cycle we'd have to deal with
 
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
um contributions that have already come
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
in and how to handle those to make sure
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
that nobody is returning money that they
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.069 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
speaking of the AG I don't know if you
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
guys already talked about this are you
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
were you gonna have somebody come in and
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
talk to us about or ask them about what
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
their most common what they see is the
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
most common and what they would like to
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
have I don't know whether Ann Edwards
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
would come in or there's somebody else
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
there I don't remember his name but
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we did discuss we didn't set a date
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
because the deputy secretary was here so
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
that was convenient for next week for
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
next time but
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
um we did discuss we wanted to see what
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
the most common violations were
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and to representative muirhead's
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
Point uh how how egregious are these
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
um which one of these could we stomach
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
um tweaking or doing away with and which
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
ones are actually like affronts to
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
transparency in the in the limits and
 
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah that's right chapter log of
 
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:18.890 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah that's right chapter log of
that

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
so it looks like it's HP 263 from
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
representatively in my opinion having
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
the aid someone from the AG's office
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and discuss with us the most common
 
01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:46.339 align:start position:0%
uh campaigns Finance reporting
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
requirements that are violated and
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
an idea the seriousness of each category
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good idea would you
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
care to contact them and invite them for
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
our May 16th meeting
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't hear you
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
say the AG
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
person in charge of these things used to
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
give us a thick report every year of all
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
the investigations but I haven't seen
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
one of those and yeah I mean and five or
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
six years and Edwards came in and talked
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
to us about orientation but I don't
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
do we want to scroll through the
 
01:03:57.609 --> 01:03:57.619 align:start position:0%
definitions is that too tedious to see
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
do we actually want to like
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
go through it like a study group
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
is everything a college everything
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's this is what we do this is really
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
good a lawyer college professor you know
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
and they did give me a degree I believe
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
the last half the class is asleep you're
 
01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
we better ramp it up then because I see
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
the members of the public and thank you
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
all for being here by the way
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
appear to be awake so we need to ramp
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
this up who doesn't who doesn't wake up
 
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
thinking God I want to talk about
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
detailed campaign Finance laws and
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
disclosures today it sounds just amazing
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
so try this page 218 664 13A there's a
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
typo we should fix that one can we all
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
agree on that no how dare you repot into
 
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.490 align:start position:0%
agree on that no how dare you repot into
reports

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
where is that
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
page 218 the first page on 664 which
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
down to 664 13-a repots by
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
governor-elect yeah of course
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of these things
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh where does it say repots
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's uh 664 13A third line under in the
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
table of contents oh repots yeah yeah as
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I think they just heard HP
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
I I think they were hearing this one
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think they were hearing the
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
is it online do you have the RSA online
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
or is that just a typo in this book I
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that's not our only
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
accomplishment though right we could
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
take that and restart somewhere in real
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
political fashion we could take that
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
back and be like look at what we did
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative mirrorhead uh in
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
response to your question
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
you just uh passed to me which was an
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency I'm going to
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
read it uh would it be appropriate to
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
invite members of the public to offer
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
comments and suggestions I'm certainly
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
not against it in principle these
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
meetings are not advertised as public
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
hearings but
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh I'd say that's uh
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
we'll play that by ear that's to me
 
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
we'll play that by ear that's to me
that's

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to me that's uh more of a Time issue
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
if we if we have time
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
as I've said I plan on this these
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
meetings going from 10 to 12. I'm not
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
going to be rigid about it but for
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
planning purposes and if we have extra
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't violate any protocol that
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of regarding work sessions
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
where's the typo Jerry well it's it's
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now it's not
 
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.049 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now it's not
online

01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:06.059 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I brought it we're gonna get
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
logged out of the typo
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
are you looking at you're looking at
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that's on the SOS but that's not the
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
nobody cares okay would someone please
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
tell me exactly what we're looking at it
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
appears so on the New Hampshire gen
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
court site which is where the RSA is
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
housed online it is correct on the
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website it is your
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts it makes me feel so much better
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
so as a typo in the printed version
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
Professor the election was for the
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Side so it says
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
repots right here oh I see I see but on
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
on lot but on the website that you're on
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
which is where we look up the rsas it is
 
01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.930 align:start position:0%
which is where we look up the rsas it is
reports

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.609 align:start position:0%
reports
um

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
they're different that's what I'm
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
establishing they're they're they're
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
I personally prefer repots but that's
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
I guess we can
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
I guess we could we just have to Define
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
it just have to Define repots
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
shut up
 
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:19.940 align:start position:0%
he was never he was never gonna talk
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
as chairman of this of the subcommittee
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
do I have the authority to stipulate
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
that repot as published
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
in this list of election laws is uh is
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to be read as report can I stipulate
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
that you know if without objection in
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
the interest of moving on in the
 
01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:45.620 align:start position:0%
discussion without objection
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
all right ready for lunch
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
so just want to go through definition do
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
you want to set we've got what our goal
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
is to get out of here and zip through
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
them just want to just want to start
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
with 664.1
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
and just yeah read it and yeah let's do
 
01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
it all right
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers to read it
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
well we have a college professor here
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
whose idea was this
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Muirhead thank you
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter show apply to
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
All State primary General and special
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
elections but you'll only apply to
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
presidential preference primaries as
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
provided in a section the provisions
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
relating to political advertising push
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%

through 22 shall additionally apply
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%

School District and Village District
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
collections thank God definitions as
 
01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:45.140 align:start position:0%
used in this chapter
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
we're moving on to section two now
 
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:50.900 align:start position:0%
section two that's what you're doing
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between the
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
presidential preference primary and a
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh that's the same thing presidential
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
primary is the presidential preference
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
primary Institute strike preference so
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
you want to strike preference no unless
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a legal term of artifice or
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
something well to be fair they would
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
know they actually are
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
um different they are actually well
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
they're not different in effect but they
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
are different in word here so
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
presidential in first sentence the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
president preface primaries and segments
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
presidential primary so just want to
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
strike preference
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of inconsistencies in the whole
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
chapter well let's let's clean that up
 
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.610 align:start position:0%
chapter well let's let's clean that up
then

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
see we did it we thought we were you
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
ever I thought the definitions was going
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
to be a joke and then
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the applicability excuse the Liars
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
the applicability oh God here comes I
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
will tell you the definitions are often
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
the heart of the issue well they're
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
important too because they help prevent
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
future confusion and ambiguity which
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
leads to confusion
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
they themselves created
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
and create a greater potential for
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
conflict which is bad
 
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.490 align:start position:0%
conflict which is bad
generally

01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh if that's a suitable definitions
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
in section two is used in this chapter
 
01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:10.340 align:start position:0%
one election quotes means any general
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
biennial or special election
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
here we have political party primary
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
or here's presidential preferencing or
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
presidential preference primary oh no
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
has provided RSA 64-1 so we're going to
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
stretch scratch preference again yeah
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
unless again I think we might unless
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
there's some do some Googling different
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
reasons specificity of the word
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
preference is adding something important
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
we can keep it but if not we said we
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
were going to protect first in the
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
nation and here we are yeah
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
maybe we should maybe we should delete
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
preference and add first in the nation
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
to ever use the president okay and there
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
candidate means any person publicly
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
declared as such and for whom votes are
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
sought in an election okay let's pause
 
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.510 align:start position:0%
sought in an election okay let's pause
there

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
person who's publicly declared as such
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
and whose votes are sought in an
 
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:25.689 align:start position:0%
and whose votes are sought in an
election

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:25.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
that would not include what we call a
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
write-in candidate
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
well a part right in Canada if they're
 
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
publicly declared and it's interesting
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
that I agree publicly to clear because
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
we in my town committee uh you know we
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
sent around an email saying suggesting
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
that everybody write in so and so for an
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
office that had no formally declared
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
candidate so we've it's a different
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
category I think it can be a write-in
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
campaign can't that be carried out
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
without you
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment by the proposed candidate
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm aware of such things happening
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
on the town level we did we did it
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack County for um
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney for the county attorney a
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
or maybe Iranian publicly is you know
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
filed you're filing who is filed for
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
their candidacy with the Secretary of
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
State well that doesn't happen until
 
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.649 align:start position:0%
State well that doesn't happen until
June

01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
June
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
um publicly declared but don't they have
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
to publicly declare if they're going to
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
run what's a public what is publicly
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
declared I'm running for you know House
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives as a grading candidate
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
I mean they're going to have to do
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
something even if you might have been
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
that once you publicly declare
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
even if you just make an announcement
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
that announcement triggers a range of
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
legal responsibilities even though you
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
haven't formally filed yet
 
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
and so the day for instance the
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
candidates show up at Secretary of
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
State's office with their petitions
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying the presidential preference
 
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
saying the presidential preference
primary

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.330 align:start position:0%
primary
um

01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
you know it is often quite a while after
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
they've already announced their campaign
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
and are maybe considered candidates
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
under the loft
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm aware of instances where an
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
individual is proposed
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
for an office
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
and had no involvement in that
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh such candidates can have no
 
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.189 align:start position:0%
uh such candidates can have no
involvement

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
in such efforts and people have a right
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
to write in whoever they wish on a
 
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.870 align:start position:0%
to write in whoever they wish on a
ballot

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:29.179 align:start position:0%
and other people have
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
a right guarantee by the First Amendment
 
01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.290 align:start position:0%
a right guarantee by the First Amendment
to

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
say positive things about other people
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
in connection with that so I'm just I'm
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
just saying that this sentence has
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
written does not seem to apply to
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
write-in candidates or those campaigning
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
for such
 
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
do we need to change it I don't I'm not
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
convinced we do
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
well this bookmark it is an interesting
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
phrase person publicly declared as such
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
and if we discover in future research
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
that it has caused issues right or
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
confusions maybe we'll have to come back
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
to it is that fair yes number three
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
political committee means any
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
organization of two or more persons that
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
promotes the success or defeat of a
 
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
candidate or candidates
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
or measure or measures
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
including the political Committee of a
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
three so oh so so this has sub this has
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
three three definitions so this is a b c
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
d e a b c d
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that's a 3A 3B if that's
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
permitted to go ahead any segregated
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
fund established by any organization the
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of which is to promote the
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
success or defeat
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
of a candidate or candidates or measure
 
01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:53.090 align:start position:0%
of a candidate or candidates or measure
measures

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
C any organization that has as its major
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
purpose to promote the success or defeat
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
of a candidate or candidates or measure
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
or measures and whose receipts or
 
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.090 align:start position:0%
or measures and whose receipts or
expenditures

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
total twenty five hundred dollars or
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
more in a calendar year for that purpose
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess that would not be redundant
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
because section A said two or more
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
persons so section c could include one
 
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.270 align:start position:0%
persons so section c could include one
person

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
that has also spent money I want to
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
Circle back to a okay
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
you know and and I have trouble
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
accepting that an organization to would
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
apply to one person
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
right so if it has to be two people then
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
then C is covered by a because any group
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
of two people or more regardless of
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
whether they've raised or spent any
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
money counts as a political committee
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
any group of two people more that
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
promotes the success or defeat of a
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
candidate or candidates measure measure
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
so two people in my living room we call
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
ourselves the lime Road you know gin
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
drinkers Club but if we're acting to
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
promote a measure you don't even have to
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
do that if uh well going back to a it if
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
if a husband and a wife don't like
 
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
if a husband and a wife don't like
something

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
so anyway we should continue with the
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
full definition but I think that's there
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
is actually an opportunity to tweak
 
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
there or at least streamline and
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
definitely one is covered by the other
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
no doubt any organization number d
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
letter d that does not have as its major
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
purpose that that does not have its
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
major purpose to promote the success or
 
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
defeat of a candidate or candidates or
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
measure or measures but that makes
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures that total five thousand
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year or more
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
in a calendar year that's that's
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
extremely broad that's technically every
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
company in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah technically yeah well it's my
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
household too technically yes actually
 
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:54.260 align:start position:0%
yeah actually that's not even
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
technically that is yeah every five
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more I mean that's
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
um any segregate so that's just there
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's a little weirdness here in in
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
the definitions
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
any segregated fund that's voluntarily
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
registered with Secretary of State for
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
the purpose of reporting its receipts
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and expenditures under this chapter or
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
any organization that voluntarily
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
registers Secretary of State without
 
01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:22.850 align:start position:0%
registers Secretary of State without
regard

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
regard
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
to whether such segregated fund or
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
organization meets the receiver or
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
expenditure thresholds described in this
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph that covers your tea party
 
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.090 align:start position:0%
paragraph that covers your tea party
online

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:34.100 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
if it's registered with the with the
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State for reporting
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
receipts and expenditures
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
next paragraph discusses what
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
constitutes an organization which
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
answers the question I was just having
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
sort of well we'll read it it sort of
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
answers it
 
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.050 align:start position:0%
answers it
right

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
or any organization that registers the
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
secretary of state with that regard to
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
whether such segregated fund
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
organization meets the cedar expenditure
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
thresholds as used in this paragraph
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
quote organization includes but it's not
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
entities formed under semicolon entities
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
formed under state law except those
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
entities qualified under Section 501c3
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
1986 semicolon
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
committees formed by a candidate
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
exploratory campaign or political party
 
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.149 align:start position:0%
exploratory campaign or political party
semicolon

01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
semicolon
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
and any other Association of natural
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
persons or entities formed under state
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
law that's not registered as a business
 
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:42.130 align:start position:0%
law that's not registered as a business
entity

01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
so my my favorite part is is
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to
 
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
so here's the definition but hey this
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:55.940 align:start position:0%
am I reading that wrong well it includes
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
the way I was taught includes but not
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
limited to is redundant because includes
 
01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:02.689 align:start position:0%
limited to is redundant because includes
means

01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
here are some examples of what it
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
includes not not all of them not all of
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
them so
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying some people
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree with that and
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
I've noticed in the statute sometimes it
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
says includes and sometimes it says
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
includes but not limited to so but
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
either way it's yeah either way it's
 
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
expansive because
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
I guess the only thing that really
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
disqualifies is
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's like we're giving these as specific
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
examples but there might be more out
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
that are not registered as a business
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
entity so they they excluded business
 
01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:39.470 align:start position:0%
entity so they they excluded business
entities

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
but any group it still goes back to any
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
I still take issue with a which is any
 
01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:48.659 align:start position:0%
organization of two or more people
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
that promotes the excess or defeat of a
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
candidate I mean that is that is
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
then C just requires them to spend money
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
so correct in other words a will catch
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
them if they don't spend money and c
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
will catch them if they spend money
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think that I think that's the
 
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
difference that's the difference but I I
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
take issue with the political committee
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
being an organization of two or more
 
01:21:12.179 --> 01:21:14.450 align:start position:0%
being an organization of two or more
people

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
I mean if if my wife and I say we like
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
Alderman X
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
in this race
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
well we have now there's two of us
 
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
right have now promoted the success or
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
defeat of a candidate
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
but it's not one or more natural persons
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
yeah you have
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's I mean it's a literal reading
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
right right yeah you know because we
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't assumed a name right
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
so it it needs to be I think it needs to
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
be tightened up
 
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
so it's under that each of us sitting
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
here right now in this room is a
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
political committee then
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
well I mean I've just expressed my
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
dismaya his hating of puppies and
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
kittens assumes someone will join me in
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
that and that will be a political
 
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.050 align:start position:0%
that and that will be a political
committee

01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
committee
but

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm such a puppy lover that's not what
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
um I mean you could even put in there's
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
two more people that assume a name right
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
or something you know something that
 
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:39.830 align:start position:0%
or something you know something that
obstificates

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
obstificates
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
who's behind it
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
right because if my wife and I promote
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
if I say you know Ross and Sammy Barry
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
endorse blah blah blah for Alderman I
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't actually formed a
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
political committee and it seems like
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
spending is really what we're correct
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
what's it has to be that plus a plus c
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
you could combine the two
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
right an organization two or more people
 
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
I I would I would I would I mean could
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
you just do with array of a entirely
 
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.130 align:start position:0%
you just do with array of a entirely
right

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if you can that's not a
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
like we need to that's a that is an
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
actual question could you actually do
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
away with a entirely
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know why did they feel it was
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
necessary to do one as an organization
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
without spending money in one with with
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
spending money and you know why why is
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
it there was there some incident I can
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
send that off to the our researcher yeah
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
our our researcher I'll send that off to
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think everyone's these paragraphs
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for some reason well 100
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah 100 but it's like all things you
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
know you put it's it's even you
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
the question is did something that they
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
add to it actually end up encapsulating
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
stuff in front of it you know
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah because yeah because they don't
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
always do it as a whole correct so we
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
definitely want to look at
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
why do I get the feeling that some poor
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
that the research is going to have to go
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
get a red book somewhere God God bless
 
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.729 align:start position:0%
get a red book somewhere God God bless
them

01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll figure out why that is and
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
we'll Circle back to it not to belabor
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
would you like me to read since you've
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
been reading so well by the way it is
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
truly very melodic uh how appropriate
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
section four political party or party
 
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
means any political organization or a
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
number of persons which can nominate
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
candidates in any manner prescribed by
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
law and has done so for the current
 
01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.729 align:start position:0%
law and has done so for the current
election

01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
the definition of the word party
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
contained in RSA 65211 shall not apply
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
to this chapter so a quick uh are you
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
gonna go roll over to 65211 for us
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
probably with and has done so for the
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's weird
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
right I think that's what's making well
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's what's making them comply
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
with this section so if they did it for
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
past selections do they still have to
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
come would they have to comply for this
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.209 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to say yeah or the
 
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
current or previous or previous two or
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
three elections or something
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
because you do have the libertarian
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
party of New Hampshire right they are an
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
organization right yeah right they did
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
not nominate I mean I guess they did
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
nominate a can in the last election but
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
they may not nominate Congress we also
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
by the way don't know the Republicans or
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Democrats would technically nominate
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a it's a fantasy world that
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't but it's in theory it's
 
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.270 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't but it's in theory it's
possible

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
possible
um

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
so hardy shall mean 650 to 11. any
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
political organization which at the
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
preceding state general election
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
received at least four percent the total
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
number of votes cast for any one of the
 
01:26:04.739 --> 01:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
number of votes cast for any one of the
following

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
Governor or offices of United States
 
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
Governor or offices of United States
senators

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
senators
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
and then the definition of the word
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
party containers they shall not apply to
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
this chapter is the more expansive
 
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
definition so this is a more expansive
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
definition for campaign Finance purposes
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
which is probably good but I think yeah
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
I mean I would read it as this meaning
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
I mean we might make it a little more
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
clear than saying this but it's the the
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
election that they are now spending
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
money on and participating in yeah what
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
I love here is in any manner prescribed
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
by law except for we actually Define it
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the law right
 
01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.490 align:start position:0%
in the law right
okay

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you read that like okay
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure we're on the
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
same page any manner prescribed by law
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
except for where we actually say what it
 
01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:54.020 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
exactly actually I have a question but
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
would uh somebody Define for me I've
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
read this many times with the definition
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
of a natural person
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.689 --> 01:27:13.699 align:start position:0%
yeah okay an individual human being
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
would include
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
any legal entity so it would include a
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
corporation a partnership an LLC so
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
person but a natural person is
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
an individual human
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
an organization is defined
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
can be defined is defined in this
 
01:27:42.659 --> 01:27:44.930 align:start position:0%
can be defined is defined in this
uh

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:46.940 align:start position:0%
party of
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
664.2 is defined as
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
by as little as one natural person
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
but a political committee
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
to find in Roman numeral three
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
a requires two or more people
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
well there's multiple ways to become a
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
01:28:09.239 --> 01:28:10.930 align:start position:0%
political committee
yes

01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:10.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three a and 664. two or
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
more people that's one of the ways and I
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
I take it we're coming back to it but I
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
take issue with it that's one of the
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
ways to form a political committee
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
another way is to be a singular person
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
who spends who hits the threshold right
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
so if like yeah if I you know if I could
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
register as a political committee click
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
and spend three thousand dollars
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
which should be different from your
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
candidates committee
 
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
candidates committee
yeah

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things we did get
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
rid of thank God
 
01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:52.629 align:start position:0%
rid of thank God
because

01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
the famous Sweeney Sweeney Alexander
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
Berry some call it the Barry Sweeney
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
so they put Alexander last even though
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
um are we good with four
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's just it has done so
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
for the current election is a little bit
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
grammatically awkward but it sort of
 
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
makes the point that they're doing it
 
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.310 align:start position:0%
makes the point that they're doing it
now

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah am I up again
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
yeah political Committee of a political
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
party means a state county regional City
 
01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:35.699 align:start position:0%
ward or town Committee of a political
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
party a regional committee shall be
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
composed only of members who are
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
residents of towns or cities that form a
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
contiguous land area and shall have been
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
created and approved by the state
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
Committee of the political party to
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
establish Regional committees a party
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
shall amend its bylaws to authorize them
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
in principle a copy of the bylaw or
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
authorization and evidence of the
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
approval for each Regional committee by
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
the state committee shall be filed by
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
the political party with the Secretary
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
of State before the first Wednesday in
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
it was done in Rockingham County we were
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
on a teacher you want to take shipping
 
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
on a teacher you want to take shipping
okay

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
I I am the the chairman of a regional
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I've never been informed by the
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
state committee that they've done so I
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
why does this section
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
um detail the regional committee but
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
leave out City ward Town committees why
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
is it so detailed about the regional
 
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:50.090 align:start position:0%
is it so detailed about the regional
committee

01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
I mean it's really teachable about the
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
regional committee
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's really like it got I think they
 
01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
covered it I'll give them that City ward
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
and uh Towner to find elsewhere and
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
understood entities that was trying to
 
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
Define Regional
 
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
as to differentiate no to differentiate
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
them from other things but but it
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify who shall constitute the
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
members of a city
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
town or
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
Ward committee it does for the regional
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
committees no but but that would be left
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
why there's a single Regional committees
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of who can be an actual member
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that actually comes up
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
speaking as the chairman of such a
 
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.450 align:start position:0%
speaking as the chairman of such a
committee

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:37.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
for some reason there are people from
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
towns outside are defined three towns
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
that would like to actually be members
 
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's an actual thing that comes up
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
I I would wonder if is it even
 
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.250 align:start position:0%
I I would wonder if is it even
appropriate

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
to tell to tell a I I do take issue when
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
the state tells political parties how to
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
organize like I've taken issue with that
 
01:32:04.729 --> 01:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
since day one I don't like the state
 
01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
telling private organizations how to
 
01:32:06.179 --> 01:32:07.370 align:start position:0%
telling private organizations how to
organize

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
organize
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
um but this is for campaign Finance
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
purposes so I guess we need to see
 
01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.010 align:start position:0%
purposes so I guess we need to see
what

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
where does that fall to my point of it
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
earlier where does that fall with the
 
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.890 align:start position:0%
earlier where does that fall with the
um

01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see an example of a regional
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
committee I can't
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have Upper Valley Democrats and
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh yeah absolutely contiguous I mean our
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
our three towns and our bylaws is
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
approved by the the State political
 
01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
approved by the the State political
committee

01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh include this restriction on
 
01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:52.430 align:start position:0%
uh include this restriction on
membership

01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.229 align:start position:0%
membership
so

01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh all right why is it enshrined in
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
State Statute is a question I've had for
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
quite a while because if they spend
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
money then they are a political
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee and have to abide by the rules
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
they have to be they have to disclose
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's a disclosure saying that if they
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
are this then they have to disclose I
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
don't think it's trying to say who is in
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
and out of that committee but it does
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
say that though who can be a member of a
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
regional committee there's a lot of
 
01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
a political Committee of a political
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
party once their receipts or
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures exceeded I think it's a
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
thousand now that they we would then
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
have to file a report but why does it
 
01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:38.330 align:start position:0%
have to file a report but why does it
Define

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
Define
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
if someone from a town outside those
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
three towns
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to join us as a full member why
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
would I have to why do I have to say no
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
right I mean that that's between that
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
should be between the political
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee the political party and the
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
political party organization
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
it seems like this section is in one
 
01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.850 align:start position:0%
it seems like this section is in one
hand

01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know delineating what kind of group
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
counts as a political committee for
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance purposes but on the
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
other hand is also
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
restricting what kind of group can call
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
itself a regional Committee of the party
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
right so that if I were to form a rogue
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
group Western New Hampshire dams
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
um the maybe the New Hampshire state
 
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
democratic party could use this to say
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to you have your your
 
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
bylaws haven't been submitted and
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
approved the I don't know if we're
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
statute I do know it is
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
at least past president from the
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that the
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
term the various terms Republican
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
Democrat and libertarian are the
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
respective property of those recognized
 
01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
respective property of those recognized
parties

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:34:50.169 --> 01:34:50.179 align:start position:0%
um yeah so like I I I could not go form
 
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
Democrats against Muirhead
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
um as much as I would like to
 
01:34:55.139 --> 01:34:56.709 align:start position:0%
um as much as I would like to
um

01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
you could not form Republicans against
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm not here next week you'll know
 
01:35:01.139 --> 01:35:03.050 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm not here next week you'll know
why

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
well we'll have a theory anyway
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
and the Democrats were against you
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
why would you want to miss such an
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's just an easy it's an easy
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
intellectual exercise I mean that so
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
anyways going back to the original
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
underlying premise
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
the parties own the term
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to flip through here I don't
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
see where Regional Town City ward
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
or County committee are mentioned again
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
why the re why the regional
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
I mean I I would do anything other than
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay all right maybe we can we can each
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think right and I think we can each
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
ask well I mean I wonder if there's a
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
history each of us ask our party
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
our parties just do they have any
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
history about why this might be here
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah because she may not know it may not
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
be anywhere you know it definitely seems
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh political advertising means any
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
communication including buttons or
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
printed materials attached to Motor
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
Vehicles which expressly or implicitly
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
Advocates the success or defeat of any
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
agree right
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
what's his name I guess there's any
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
communication it's any communication
 
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.709 align:start position:0%
communication it's any communication
expressly

01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
expressly
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
so why don't why doesn't say public
 
01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.649 align:start position:0%
so why don't why doesn't say public
advertisement

01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
advertisement
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
means any communication was just get rid
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the including print like why is that
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it should say but not limited to to
 
01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:10.460 align:start position:0%
go back up to the other one
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
as long as we're consistent yeah I mean
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think we just need to be concerned can
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
we just delete the part about it's funny
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
like why would you know why wouldn't it
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
be buttons or rubber stickers
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
well it should be
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe maybe why those are in there
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
is because people don't get paid so I
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
have to pay the newspaper to run an ad
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
or pay a radio station I'm not paying
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
people to wear my butt
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
no but you're Distributing the button
 
01:37:36.659 --> 01:37:39.590 align:start position:0%
no but you're Distributing the button
right

01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't if we don't need to I don't
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
know it just seems it just seems weird
 
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
that that's how do you attach a button
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
to a motor vehicle anyway that's it well
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
it might might be helpful to keep
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
reading through the statute yeah there
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
is communication next and see and see
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
how these terms are used yeah because we
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
are going in alphabetical no I guess
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
we're not even going alphabetical order
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
um communication shall include but not
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
be limited to
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
there's you're not include but not
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
limited to it's not even included but
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
not limited
 
01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's not even anyways uh publication in
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
any newspaper or other periodical or any
 
01:38:15.850 --> 01:38:15.860 align:start position:0%

01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
well I have seen it I don't like it but
 
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:51.260 align:start position:0%
in some documents you can put in
 
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
including means and then you say that it
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
means everything you know not just
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
what's listed and that way you don't
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
have to keep coming through here and say
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to so then we
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
can it'll it'll cover everything in 664.
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
if if we want to do that
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure that's our biggest
 
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
problem but it's something that we could
 
01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
do to clean it up
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
the nice part is transmission by
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
telephone includes text messages so
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
you're all set right
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
there you go yep
 
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.010 align:start position:0%
there you go yep
um

01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
just I don't think does anything need to
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
be added
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm missing because they
 
01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:33.179 align:start position:0%
have on any internet site so that covers
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
basically all forms of digital
 
01:39:35.159 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
basically all forms of digital
means

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.450 align:start position:0%
means
um

01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
I I guess if you wanted to get really
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
into the weeds which I don't even think
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's necessary but if
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted to you could
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know there are placements on apps
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
that get used
 
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.030 align:start position:0%
that get used
um

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I do know a thing that is happening
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
more and more is
 
01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.590 align:start position:0%
more and more is
um

01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
so you have these services that don't
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
allow Express political advertisings
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
right so like Tick Tock does not allow
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
for Express political advertisements
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
conversely I can go and hire an
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
influencer and push my message
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and that influencer wouldn't have to
 
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
um and that influencer wouldn't have to
say

01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know and and so and so campaign is
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
this being paid for by so-and-so
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
campaign they have to be disclosed in
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance reports
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
but it looks like the point of I know
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get to it but the point of
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
the disclosures on Communications
 
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.790 align:start position:0%
the disclosures on Communications
um

01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
um
wouldn't

01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be to include that
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you could make an argument is that is
 
01:40:51.649 --> 01:40:51.659 align:start position:0%
that any public address system
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
um but I might I might like to come back
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
to that and explore that more of
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
paying people a paid spokesman saying
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
something political I mean that's
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
effectively we're talking about
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
how do we cover that because that is
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
that is becoming more prevalent and I
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see a lot of it in
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
the next cycle
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
especially on these mediums that don't
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
allow Express advertisements yeah I mean
 
01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
I I have a thought and
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
a suggestion
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
I do want to be out of here by noon I
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
think we should be out of here by noon
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
two hours at one stretch I think is long
 
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
enough and uh I think we should reserve
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
the last five minutes or so just to re
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
review uh amongst us action items that
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
we've accepted and well we think the key
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
points are we've identified here we
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that in about five
 
01:41:48.119 --> 01:41:49.330 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that in about five
minutes

01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:49.340 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh my thought is that we should all
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
remember that we can't achieve
 
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.129 align:start position:0%
remember that we can't achieve
perfection

01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
perfection
 
01:41:58.090 --> 01:41:58.100 align:start position:0%
even if we ascribe to a totally
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
totalitarian ideal where we could
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
so I suggest we just uh maybe for the
 
01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:12.770 align:start position:0%
so I suggest we just uh maybe for the
next

01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
15 minutes to accelerate the reading of
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
the definition so we've at least read
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
them and kind of have them in our minds
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
because I was talking on the big fishes
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
in general yeah we should focus on the
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
things that have the biggest impact on
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
what we're concerned about
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
in my case balancing privacy and burden
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
against transparency but well we just
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
finished reading the the uh definitions
 
01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:41.390 align:start position:0%
finished reading the the uh definitions
okay

01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
warm your heart I'm sure it will uh
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
eight contributions shall mean a payment
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
gift subscription assessment contract
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
payment for service do dues Advance
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
forbearance or loan to a Canada
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
political committee made for the purpose
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
of influencing the nomination or
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
election of any candidate contributions
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
shall include there you go the use of
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
anything of value but shall not include
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
the services of volunteers who receive
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
no pay therefore or the use of personal
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%

the candidate for child care
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
no doubt an issue that has come up as
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the special committee on
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
child care I'm very excited to see that
 
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.870 align:start position:0%
child care I'm very excited to see that
yeah

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
just added in 19 or 19 because it was
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
not clear and there were some folks who
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
were paying using campaign contributions
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
to take care of their kids while they
 
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
campaign campaign but it wasn't clear
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people questioned it so it
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
was put in specifically seems perfectly
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable expenditure shall mean the
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%

01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm putting a star next to that
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
because that needs to be
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
tightened up uh any communication by any

or any authorized committee or agent of
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
such candidate can we at least
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it's a huge run on sentence
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
yes and I would like to go back it seems
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
like almost every year maybe not this
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
year we got a definition about adding
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
things into expenditure and trying to do
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
some specific things that people had
 
01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.810 align:start position:0%
some specific things that people had
used

01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
um money for but it was not clear
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not in some people's minds
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
whether that was truly an expenditure
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I just highlight that because it
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
seems to come up often we often see a
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
bill that way I still think this is
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive and probably
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't need it but I just bring that up
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
so that we might want to look at it in
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
between our next meeting because I it
 
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I think something we could probably
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
agree on is I don't think there should
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
be I think expenditures and I know
 
01:46:30.649 --> 01:46:30.659 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an exemption coming
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
up about like social events or something
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
I think any expenditure that a candidate
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
makes out of their campaign or pack
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
makes out of their campaign should be
 
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
accounted for that's just my personal
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
should be accounted for no matter what
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
it is it should be kind of there should
 
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
be no
 
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.090 align:start position:0%
be no
if

01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
if they want to spend it on on their
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
lobster bake that's their business but
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
we should disclose all that stuff that's
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
just my opinion but anyways uh should I
 
01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:56.750 align:start position:0%
just my opinion but anyways uh should I
continue

01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%

middle names
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
no I was not even aware you had to get
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
middle names plural middle names it
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
there you go for some of us
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
middle name or initial or initial or
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
names so technically we're supposed to
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
be collecting middle initial for every
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%

technically
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah probably look at that
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%

01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
for refining yes because it's out of
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
date that's yeah that is just a disaster
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
and I googled the math main Commission

on governmental ethics definitions it's
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
a more they're more easier ways to do
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
these definitions out there
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to me that you can make
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
a uh call that's three minutes
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it does this doesn't apply correct
 
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.050 align:start position:0%
and it does this doesn't apply correct
yep

01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh button opinion research means the

expenditures defined in paragraph 9 are
 
01:52:49.619 --> 01:52:50.450 align:start position:0%
expenditures defined in paragraph 9 are
made

01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%

is otherwise apparent and last but not
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
least 22 political advocacy
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
organizations I mean Indian team that
 
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
spends five thousand dollars more to
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
calendar year to pay for a communication
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
that is functionally equivalent to
 
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
express advocacy because when taken as a
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
whole such communication is likely to be
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
interpreted by a reasonable person only
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
as advocating the election or defeat of
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
the clear identified candidate or
 
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
candidates or the success of it or
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
defeat of a measurement measures taking
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
into account whether the communication
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
involved mentions a candidacy or a
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
political party or takes a position on a
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
candidates characters qualifications for
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
all right okay there is an action item I
 
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
could suggest that maybe individuals
 
01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.450 align:start position:0%
could suggest that maybe individuals
collect

01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
a list form you know individuals want to
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
make changes to this section bring a
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
list of suggested changes to the next
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and distribute it
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
I agree with that
 
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I do I will send off to our
 
01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
um I do I will send off to our
researcher

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.010 align:start position:0%
researcher
um

01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
Regional committees
 
01:54:21.119 --> 01:54:22.729 align:start position:0%
Regional committees
and

01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
um section three
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
um 6642 section three number eight uh
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
letter A
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
about why
 
01:54:31.619 --> 01:54:34.189 align:start position:0%
about why
um

01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
the why the definition exists
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
so that's those are the two things I'm
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
doing and apparently what professor
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
are you Professor or Dr mirin
 
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
um Professor I feel like if you can't
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
help someone who's having a heart attack
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
oh wow you shouldn't be called doctor
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's right that's that's very high in
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
my interview well I would say it's it's
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
context dependent if if someone needs
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
urgent help in resolving a question of
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
political Theory I think you could then
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
use the title
 
01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.550 align:start position:0%
use the title
so

01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
anyway Ross would you repeat those two
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
please uh I'm doing
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%

01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
as a research question and

uh Section 5 as to Regional committees
 
01:55:34.609 --> 01:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
why are we doing that sort of stuff
 
01:55:34.619 --> 01:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
why are we doing that sort of stuff
okay

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
