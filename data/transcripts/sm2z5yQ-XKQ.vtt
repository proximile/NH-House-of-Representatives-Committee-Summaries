um I would like to point
out

out
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
that if you're if we're not already

aware um House Bill 781 is an early
Bill

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
therefore uh we need to take some action
 
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee with respect to HB
 
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
781 uh no later than Wednesday of this
 
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
week um 131 does not operate under that
 
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.390 align:start position:0%
week um 131 does not operate under that
same

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
constraint now as I'm sure you have
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
observed as as we have
 
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
observed the language in HP 781 as
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
introduced and the language of 131 as in
 
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
introduced are identical
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
except that in house bille
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
781 the so-called early
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
Bill there is a section two beginning on
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation to open the work session
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there for the record is
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
there anyone who would like to speak to
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
either one of these bills from
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
the public no
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
okay um representative litfield or
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Hall do you have any
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
comments that you would like to make as
 
00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
part of an opening statement with
 
00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
Mo thank you Mr
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
chairman what I'd like to say is you're
 
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely right the wording Within
 
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
These two bills is it's essentially the
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
same except for um the financial
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
distribution that we have available at
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
this point in time I would like to ask
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
the committee to please consider having
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
some type of funding available um so we
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't put an unfunded mandate out there
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
the governor has just been elected she
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
has asked that this be a priority um and
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
I would very much like to honor that
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
priority I realize that we only have a
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
couple of days until we need to make a
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
final decision on this we need to get
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
the um amendments by tomorrow but I
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
would love to even reach out to our
 
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
partners on the other side of the wall
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
and see if they have an appetite for any
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
type of funding as
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
you representative PA do do you have in
 
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
addition to any personal comments do you
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
have any uh are you at Liberty to share
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
what the disposition of your caucus may
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
or may not be with respect to either or
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
both of the bills yes um I think the
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
language uh oh so a couple things the
 
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
this applies to it says school districts
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
so it's only public schools and
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if we should be considering
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools as well um another or
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
private schools or whatever but at least
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools that' be one thing um I
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
know we talked
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
about uh you know the Bell to Bell and
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
all that stuff and I think that we
 
00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
really needs to to um leave that with
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
local local control that initially I
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
think to start um that we have a we ask
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
school boards or board of directors or
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
whoever they are um to set a policy
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
about cell phones let's start there as
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
far as the money you know we understand
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
that um our governor has asked for um a
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
million dollars but that doesn't pay for
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
all students and I I almost think it's
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
too early to be spending the money I
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
mean I think we should start with a
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
policy that says hey this is what you
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
need to do you need to have a cell phone
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
policy and go beyond cell phones
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually and and include electronic
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
communication devices personal
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
electronic communication devices but not
 
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
tell them that you know just say it may
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
include Beyond so it's the cell phone
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
policy but it may include those other
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
devices um so I think year one um we're
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
not opposed to having money but whether
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded mandate million dollar
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
is not going to get pouches for everyone
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
so I think our plan our position is if
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
we could have the Pol have the language
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
right now to say that this is what we
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
want you to develop a policy on I don't
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
even know and maybe you folks know what
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
does what does our governor think that
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
that million dollars is going to do what
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
answer I'm sorry we we can there only
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
only three of
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
us I'm sorry you mentioned a million
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
dollars is yes uh isn't the amount in in
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill 250,000 the bill is 2 is
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
right the bill so the bill is
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
250,000 the governor has put out there
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
$1 million um I tried to quickly look
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
this morning and I didn't have a chance
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
I was trying to look on the doe to see
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
how many middle and high school students
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
we have in the state of New Hampshire um
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know as yet but $1 million if
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're going by what we we had we had
 
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
someone from pelum come in and speak
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
remember the pouch system that they're
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
using which seems to be the one that
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
they're using widespread throughout the
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
country right now that's $30 a pouch so
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
if you do the math a million dollars
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
divided by $30 that would give us
 
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.230 align:start position:0%
divided by $30 that would give us
33,333

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
33,333
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
pouches so I don't know how many middle
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
and high school students we have so I
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that would cover them
 
00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
all or not the basis of both of the
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
bills is for the state to take a
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
position that school boards need to
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt policy concerning
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
student cell phone use in
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
schools which we were reminded by the
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
last next to last person who testified
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill that we were hearing uh is
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
the next room with the anyway wherever
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
it is uh in committee about the state's
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
overall responsibility for
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
Education um therefore that would uh
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
require constitutional requirement would
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
be satisfied and would be in the
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
requirement would be in no way in
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
conflict with responsibility that the
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
state has for overall education policy
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
while at the same time respecting with
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the language of both of these bills that
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
the specific policies that are developed
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
and adopted and implemented would be the
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the local school
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
boards do do we have a do we have
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
agreement with respect to the question
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
of State responsibility do we have
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
agreement that it would be appropriate
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
for us to have the state take the
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
position that school board should
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
develop adopt and Implement policies
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to cell phone usage in
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
school what I'm trying to do is build
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
this from the ground up yeah yes well no
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
sorry no yes I agree building it I
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying um I if if
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
I may at this point may I just introduce
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
to you both the language that is in
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
house bill to in the budget I don't know
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
have you either of you seen it what the
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed no may I share
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
that with everyone so okay by the way
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
Melissa would you mind taking
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
notes um officially all I have to do is
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
fill out a subcommittee work session
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
report that I've just found out about
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh when I when I spoke to Chairman
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
cordelli about whether we needed a a
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
clerk he said well you have
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield on the
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee and subcommittee and she
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
capably perform those duties for the
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
full committee so um while there is no
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
formal requirement for the uh submission
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
of of uh minutes or notes of this
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
meeting it might be helpful for our
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
recall and reporting to the full
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
committee uh in addition to any actions
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
we may take uh any anything else that
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
may be of interest so would you like
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to this
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
um the handout that you've just given
 
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
um the handout that you've just given
us

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes so the gist of the handout is the
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
school board shall develop and adopt a
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
policy um but it would peroh personal
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
device used by students during the
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
school day and be implemented schoolwide
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
with approved exceptions determined by
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs this
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
also I believe it would go into effect
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
within 60 days that's the last line yeah
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
well the you you have the the dis ofit
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
it was just um there are exceptions for
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
504 if you have an
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
IEP there it also mentions the grant
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
program to be administered by the doe
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
which is similar to the language that I
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
had so so am I uh if I may then
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
represented all uh the ACT shall take
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after its passage but
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the school board shall
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt a policy
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
Etc uh there's no specification as to
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
when school boards what there's no
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
deadline by such and such a date is that
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
am I am I just recognizing that is that
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
something of concern
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
I mean we can we can direct school
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
boards to develop and adopt and I use
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
the word Implement uh policies governing
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
student cell phone
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
use but when do they have to do this I
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
think I think the word Implement is is a
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
magical word right they you can develop
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
a policy that policy states that this
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
will take effect in September 20 you
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
know it'll be up to the local school
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
districts I would think implementing
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
with a different story do we put a we do
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
we put in a buy after
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
implement or no later
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
2020

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
six I
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
mean I think if if you don't tell people
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
when they have to do something or when
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
they have to do it if I told my kids
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
they needed to do something and they
 
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
didn't do it and I asked them why didn't
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
you do it the response that they would
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
give me frequently would be well you
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
didn't tell me when I had to do it by
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
but when it says this act shall take
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passed if the ACT
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
is you will develop not Implement you
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
will develop develop and adopt but lines
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
through East I know but where is this
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
this is from where where did it did you
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
is this your did you develop this I did
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
not devel where did this come from this
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
came from um the governor has put this
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
budget the governor has put this
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
no but we don't
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
need this is just what she's thinking
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
correct right so I that's why I think
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back and I don't think
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
our bill whatever we decide I don't
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
think it should be about implementation
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
I think it should
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
be adopt uh develop and adopt just like
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
we said here develop and uh and adopt
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
policy actually so there is a difference
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
between the we becoming a bit too uh
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
fine here by saying that um it the
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
word adopt would include Implement so
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't need to say
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
Implement can I just say the two of them
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
131 and 781 yes one's got enact yes and
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
one's got adopt I think there's a
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
difference there I think adopt is your
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
school board's going to come up with a
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
policy and they're going to vote on it
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going to to adopt it enact
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
is kind of like Implement I'm sorry
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
where's the word enact where are you
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
looking in that 131 says enact and 781
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
says adopt but is it look at the let's
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
look at the language if we may so I'm
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm being a little dense here but
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
can you help what line is the word does
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
the word inact appear sorry it's it's at
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
the top where it says an act I'm
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
under right here that's just the title
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
Ole that's just a title that has no I
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
understand the title but I'm looking at
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
the they have different it's a syn
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's almost a synonym of the word
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
adopt because if you you're adopting
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
you're enacting if you're enacting
 
00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.069 align:start position:0%
you're enacting if you're enacting
you're

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
adopting implementing on the other hand
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
means that you must execute exactly you
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
you you you can develop something you
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
can adopt something but then you need to
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
implement it okay exactly or execute at
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
some point in time the 60 days what I
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
was saying is they both say okay they're
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
both language so you believe that the
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
that line nine and line 13 in each of
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
the bills is indicative that
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
well in 131 it says 60 days in 781 it
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
says July 1st 2025 Y which means that
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
upon it upon um enactment by the general
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
court and and a signature of the
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
governor that either 60 days or July 1
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
2025 depending on which of these might
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
make it through that that the school
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
boards have to do this in in the next
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
three or four months is that
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
realistic I'm saying I don't think
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
adopting means that they have to it says
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
they have to adopt a policy okay so then
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
the the ACT shall take effect in the
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
sense that the directive being given to
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
the school boards is either 60 days
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
after Passage they have to know by 60
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
days after passage or by July 1 2025
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
they have to be
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
informed that they now have to do thus
 
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.669 align:start position:0%
informed that they now have to do thus
and

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to be be clear
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that is the
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have and whether
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
that would carry the
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
time because now we have two questions
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
before us in my way of thinking develop
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
and adopt and
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
Implement means that you're executing on
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
what you've
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
adopted you adopt something then you're
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
bound to do something about it you may
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily have to say execute or
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
implement but it makes it abundantly
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
clear that that's what has to happen
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
then we have the issue of well when does
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
it take
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
effect when does the clock start
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
what what are your
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
thoughts whether whether the word
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
implement or uh execute appears in in
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
the language we still have developed an
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
adopt that we haven't disagreed on it's
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's there in both of these
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
bills and the clock starts 60 days or
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
2025 and that means what that that's
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
when the school boards have to start
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
acting upon the law or that they
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
actually have to develop and adopt by
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
those dates I say the acting upon the
 
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.149 align:start position:0%
those dates I say the acting upon the
law

00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
is is develop and adopting the policy
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
you were on the school board you could
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean you adopt a policy and you
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
when you adopt a policy I would think
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
you decide when is going to take effect
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
when are you going to implement this
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
policy we're I I think we're telling now
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
well but also if it's something that
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
came down from the state they would
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
determine when we have to have this
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
implemented by right well do we want to
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
leave this to Ru making or do we want to
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually put into the language of the
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill when the school board shall develop
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
and adopt a policy no later than such
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
and such a date all right and the ACT
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
takes effect July 1st 2025 or 60 days
 
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.549 align:start position:0%
takes effect July 1st 2025 or 60 days
after

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
passage excuse
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
me I'm almost better so um so the the
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
dates are not necessarily the same the
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
law goes into effect in SE July 1st 2025
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
or 60 days after passage either one of
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
those unless we come up with something
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
else but that does not tell the school
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
boards when what what the deadline is
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
for them to develop and adopt the policy
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
develop do we want to see do we want to
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
see them work working on this for an
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
indeterminate period of time or a
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
determinate period determined period of
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
time is your definition of working on it
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
to adopt a policy no no I mean no no you
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
can you you could a school board could
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
assign a work group to work on adopt on
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
developing the policy for that school
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
district with an eye to adopting it if
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
it receives majority the support if I'm
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
appointed as a school board member to
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
work on that sub subcommittee one of my
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
first questions is going to be well when
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
do I have to do when does this have to
 
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.669 align:start position:0%
do I have to do when does this have to
be

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
done I would think this date at the end
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
is what we're do we want it
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
right no what I see is that the ACT
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
shall take effect in other words if if
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
if either of these bills let's just say
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
that that we don't make any changes I
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying if either of
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
these bills are adopted that means that
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
becomes the that's when the clock starts
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of the requirement being placed
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
upon the school boards but it doesn't
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
tell them how long they have to develop
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
and adopt okay so we're so are we clear
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
on my we're clear am I being clear
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're clear so I think no matter what
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
we care yes so I think no matter what we
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to need these to amend these
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
spills with the date assuming that the
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
governor had mentioned that it she had
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
wanted it in the budget right if the
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget were to pass when would that
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
exactly go into effect is that the
 
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
exactly go into effect is that the
following

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
July January the following
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
July when would this money be available
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
so uh if if there was any money if there
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
were to be so the budget is for fiscal
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
year 2026 isn't it we're still in the
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
current year and we've got four months
 
00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:56.230 align:start position:0%
current year and we've got four months
to

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
go therefore the money would be
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
available later this year into early
 
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.070 align:start position:0%
available later this year into early
next

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
year so I my thought we already are
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
operating under the under the the
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
current budget the current budget year
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
expires I believe at the end of June if
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's the case we we have to adopt a
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
budget for fiscal year 2026 beginning
 
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.070 align:start position:0%
budget for fiscal year 2026 beginning
July

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
July
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
1 all right so that's the the answer to
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
your question if the money is in the in
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposed budget the
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
money is there if it survives right yeah
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
then that money would be available in
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year which would be the
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
next school year because the two run
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat concurrently yes I'm going to
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
say I mean I really don't think we are
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
ready to do anything with money I I
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
think we're at a point right now that we
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
should be just talking about what is it
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
that we want school boards to do we
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money there's not
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
enough money even with the 250,000 you
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
know you're going to start this grant
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
program the doe doesn't know what
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing I think it's way premature
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be talking about money I think we
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
should ask them to start addressing the
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
problem the problem is we need to we
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
need them to have a cell phone and
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
personal communication device policy and
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
then from there year two you know I mean
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
we're not adverse to um it's just
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
premature won't school boards do what
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
they can do within their means if there
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
is to be any money spent my my my my uh
 
00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
is to be any money spent my my my my uh
older

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
older
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
son's school district is Franklin
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is two teen I have two
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
teen Grandsons in the Franklin
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts school district I realize
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
we can start tossing around school
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
districts Here There and Everywhere but
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
that District has adopted a full day ban
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
on Cell phon smart watches and tablets
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
because they believe that they are doing
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
great damage to the children
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
particularly in the learning environment
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
during the time in which they're of
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
course in which they're in
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
school there are no
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
pouches and to the best of my knowledge
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
from my conversation with him there's no
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
State money coming from the state of
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in order to implement the
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
band because if you enact a pull ban you
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to have any pouches anyway or
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
what they're whatever they were called I
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
can't remember Yonder or something yeah
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
whatever so also we have seen with
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
respect as I've read the literature with
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
respect to what's going on in the states
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
I the the specifics are all across the
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
board but there are states that have
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
adopted laws that require their local
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
school boards to develop and adopt
 
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.310 align:start position:0%
school boards to develop and adopt
policies

00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
period that's it and they have not
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
provided any
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
funding or laid on any other specifics
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
as to any
 
00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:11.470 align:start position:0%
as to any
restrictions

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions so it's wide open we can look
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
with an eye to what is being done in
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
other states for our information and
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully for our benefit as we look at
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
all of those but uh um at the very
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
least it it seems to me that we want to
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
at least get the ball rolling here and
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have that that our
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
school districts know that in order for
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
our kids to
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
have to use the word adequate an
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
adequate and appropriate education that
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
involves the learning environment and
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
the learning environment must be
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
free of unre restricted cell phone usage
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
during school hours so school districts
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
have got to do something some as my I
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
understand and and representative L
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you you know more about this than
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
I do um I understand that some have
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
adopted policies others have not correct
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
I know that for example in in Alton
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
Prospect Mountain has adopted um a
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
policy I think that if we if if we pass
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
either of these two bills or something
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
on the order of of it even without
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
money the school boards Association is
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
going to jump in and they're going to
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
start developing model policies for
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
their school boards to look at and I
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
hope it would be at least one or
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
more unless we believe that we need to
 
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.190 align:start position:0%
more unless we believe that we need to
place

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions in the legislation that
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
would therefore inform the school boards
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
Association or the school boards well we
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
can adopt and Implement develop adop and
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
Implement policies but uh they can't go
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
any further than this or they have to
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
include at least this right I right I
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
personally think that we've kind of hit
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
a point where we're kind of boiling over
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
at this point we haven't handled this
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
for years we probably should even at the
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
parental level maybe we should have
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
handled it at the educational level but
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
I feel as though the educators are
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
screaming and saying please we really
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
need your help on this will you guide us
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
so I personally feel that yes we do need
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
something to be put in um minimum
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
standards and for me personally that
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
could be as simple as it it I don't
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily feel strongly about Bell to
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
Bell you know fine let them have it at
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
lunch or or study hall or or what have
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
you if if we want to be a little bit
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
more lenient but I definitely think that
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
the schools need some type of guidance
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
and I think they do want to be able to
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
say that it's on the state at this point
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
in time they're they're looking to us
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
right now so there are two sentences
 
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.230 align:start position:0%
right now so there are two sentences
following

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
which which indicate that districts are
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
encouraged to consider exceptions to
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
student use during instruction when an
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
educator is using devices as part of a
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
lesson plan right did you that sentence
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
should be gone yeah uh explain um or
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
speak to that please oh sure
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
um because I'm hearing that there are
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
teachers a minority but you know all you
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
have to do is have one drunk driver on
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
the road too right uh that there are
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
teachers that are are are giving
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
students assignments and then they're on
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
their cell phones during class time
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
while the students are being given their
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
assignments that may or may involve
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
their cell phones so if we if we don't
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
do this what we're saying is that the
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
school boards have to deal with that
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
issue because all we're telling them to
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
do absent that sentence in it which
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
appears in both the bills is that they
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
have to they have to come up with a
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
policy and then it's up to them to
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
develop what restrictions they're going
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
to place or what permiss they're going
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
to give correct are are you talking
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
about the instructors right now or the
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
ca um the policy is what
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
would that may provide exceptions to
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
student use during instruction when the
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
educator is using devices as part of a
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
lesson plan right that if that language
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
is retained then that language must be
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
implemented if the bill passes and is
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
enacted into law so whatever policies
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
the school boards come up with it would
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to reflect faithfulness to this
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
requirement yeah we heard all from the
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from you know
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
teachers unions from teach teachers
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
whatever all those everyone in the room
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
really is that this was not a good idea
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
um and you could have a first of all in
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
most classrooms they have Chromebooks so
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that are these teachers really
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
using their they having the kids use
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
their cell phones for something that
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
can't be done on the device that's that
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
monitored by the school right I.E their
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks um the other thing you could
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
have is teacher against teacher you know
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
just oh it's okay just use your cellone
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
that that's problematic in and of itself
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
um so I personally don't think that
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
Senate should be there the language is
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
districts are encouraged to
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
consider but the districts are not
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
required I understand that right so this
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
is a May versus a shell broadly speaking
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is that we would like
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we would like school districts who
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
consider as part of their
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
policies making except I to student use
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
during instruction when an educator is
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
using devices as part of a lesson plan
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
but we're not requiring that but unless
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
we take it away in which we have said
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing about it right so if
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
we take it right if we take it away they
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
still can consider the The Only
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
Exception if we take that away the only
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
exception is hey if the kid has an IEP
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
has a 504 elll Learners um medical now
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
we're saying You must consider those
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
exceptions well sentence is it the third
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
we do in fact say that school district
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
policiy shall not prohibit students with
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities from using a device to
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
support their learning as identified by
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
the IEP or 504 plan that's right and
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
that's what we those are special cases
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and we're saying there's no negotiation
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
on that that that must be part of the of
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
the policy that the school board is is
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
going to adopt right are are you not
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the wording that I had
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
handed out because I feel like it
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
handles some of that such policy shall
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit personal device use by students
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
during the school day so they can use
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
School issued Chromebooks right um and
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
then School District policy shall not
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with disabilities from
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
using a device and that includes 504 and
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
IEP um it also includes um the Civil
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
Rights Act of 1964 I feel like that's a
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
comprehensive do you not is elll in
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
please students with so no would we
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
consider medical different from
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities then I just want to clarify
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah because medical if you go back
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
to the other if we go to um is it 381
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
what are we looking at here
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
um one
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
okay what's interesting I went back
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
through the policies from you've gone
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
through them extensively to having from
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
the other states and I've noticed that
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
epilepsy and diabetes were specifically
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
singled out I think those are the only
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
two medical disorders that I I'm not
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
sure rather than specify medical
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
disorders could we not say something on
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
the order of I mean just we're just
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
brainstorming here of course yeah
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
something on the order of uh medical
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
issues as certified by a licensed
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
physician all right I so so or or do we
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
want to start determining what those
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
conditions are that have to be validated
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
I make a suggestion yes okay my
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be school district
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
policy shall not prohibit students with
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities from using a device to
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
support their learning as identified by
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
their IEPs of five or4 that's in there
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
right now exceptions may also include
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
the use of devices to manage students
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
health care for example glue coose
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
sensors or insulin pumps just examples
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
or to support English language Learners
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
so now you you're you're including elll
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
and what was your broad category before
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
you got to your EG manage students
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care devices use of devices to
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
manage students healthare all right well
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
how is Healthcare how is English as a
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
second language a health issue no it's
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
not that's what it says okay where where
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
did the parentheses in for the EG oh
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
after the insulin pumps oh okay well so
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
I so that's so so that that's medical
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
and then you go on to yes to the Engish
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
so not seeing it was yeah I understand
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
that right we don't usually I I
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
personally to be honest I know we're
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
really getting into the weeds here but
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
um I I would personally like to see some
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
type of language where it's specific to
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
they absolutely need this device for
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring because I don't want us to go
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
down the rabbit hole of my child is
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
anxious if they don't have the phone
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
near them I mean this is a diagnosis
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's psychiatric they suffer from
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
anxiety they need to have it with them
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
physician certified medical
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
issues what what if it's a psychiatrist
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
what if it's a
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
psychologist Medical
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
Professional certified that's a good I I
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
I would personally be more comfortable
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
if we were specific and not put the
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
schools in this position of of managing
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
Healthcare you think are you concerned
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
with just managing healthare I mean I I
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of policies nowhere that
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
I see and maybe you guys did see and I I
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
always saw something along the lines of
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
managing Healthcare and most of them
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
specified insulin pumps most of them and
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
sense so
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
mentally uh
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
managing health and mental
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
health no I or just say health
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
and that covers
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
everything you you make a good point
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
like holy smokes someone said on my
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
kidneys a phone to the whole this is the
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
whole point well the problem here is
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
when we start making these
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions eventually it might lead to
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh it being so broad that you can drive
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
a truck through it right I I I'm just
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
saying that I've seen other states
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually specify yes the disorders that
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
they are using well legislators have a
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
tendency to get
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
but if you want to I mean I would say if
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
you have specific somewhere I mean I
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
believe Virginia does i i the ones I
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
look at they mentioned the pumps and the
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
um how did you feel about that like I
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
liked that oh I'm good I mean if they
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
need their if they need the device to
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
test the sugar or whatever they're doing
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
did you so the school boards need to
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
adopt policies governing cell student
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
cell phone use in
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
schools but they
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
must adopt policies that include these
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
exceptions yeah and that's why I think
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
now now now we have to come up with
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
we've already got districts are you wna
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting we get rid of
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
districts are encouraged to consider
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions to student use during
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
instruction when an educator is using
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
devices as part of a lesson plan let
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
Mista yeah I don't like that you don't
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
like that I don't think they need it as
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
part of a lesson plan I No in fact I
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't know I listened to this this this
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
English woman I mean the article that
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
got sent around and I mean I looked at
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
and I mean I when she was finished I
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize the 20 minutes had
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
passed uh no ums no huz um marvelous
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
articulation incredible knowledge uh doc
 
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.910 align:start position:0%
articulation incredible knowledge uh doc
well

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
documented and you want to talk about
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
radical go to the root of well she she's
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
she want she would just rather to ban
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
them entire because they're destroying
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
our children my opthalmologist and
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
optometrist confirms that that
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
children's eyesight is being ruined at
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
an early age I was one of those
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunate few who had to get glasses
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the fourth grade uh in my family I
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
didn't realize at the time I was only
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
fourth grade but I I had to get glasses
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
for shortsightedness at which point it
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't as bad as bullying but I used to
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
take a lot of harassment for being
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
called four eyes and everything else but
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
but this is now becoming this is she
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
said this is going to be within a few
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
years unless there this is my automet
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
now saying this unless we do something
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
society almost every child is going to
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
be wearing
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
glasses right and that's just glasses
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
that's just eyesight that's not even
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
what's happening to their brain exactly
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
I we need to get a handle on us you're
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
talking about that we we're talking
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
about the kids have full access to a a
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
world of things they shouldn't for
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
example pornography they don't need to
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
have access to that certainly not in
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
school not at all but certainly not in
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
school right exactly I I think we have
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be bold on this it's that important
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
and it and it's getting that late in the
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
game so get are you agreeing get rid of
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
that sentence yeah yeah but I do I don't
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
agree with um I know I don't know about
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
during this work session but in general
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
some people have talked about the
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
teachers not having their cell phones I
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't personally I feel like that's kind
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
of an employer employee relationship and
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
let the super tenant and the principal I
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
think deal with that at that level if it
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
becomes an issue I I would prefer to see
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
us just dealing with the student
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
body and that I mean it says governing
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
student cell phone use so the teacher
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
not really part of it but
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
um representative Terry do you agree
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we should get rid of that sentence
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
District I'm fine with getting rid of
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
that sentence I am too all right so we
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
need to take a formal action with
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
respect to recommendation
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
and Melissa because I'm a man and I
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't multitask as well as women and my
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
wife will tell you that that is
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
not that is a personal
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
observation she has picked up somewhere
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
along the line if you would note that in
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
your notes and send that to me that will
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to me in terms of
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
filling out the subcommittee report and
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
then uh submitting that to Chairman
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli so what we're talking about is
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
with respect to both bills we are
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
eliminating the sentence that
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
coincidentally in both
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
bills um begins on line five and ends on
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
line six right the sentence districts
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
are encouraged ending with the words as
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
part of a lesson land plan beginning on
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
line five and line six with respect to
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
both both bills we're eliminating it in
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
both bills not just one but both am I
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
hearing us yes all right um um I need a
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
motion I make a motion you may need a
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
motion to remove that sentence I make a
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
motion that the sentence districts are
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged to consider exceptions um to
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
student use during instruction when an
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
educator using devices as part of a
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
lesson plan that that be struck from the
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
lines five and six sorry in both bills
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
correct is there a second I'll second
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
all right any further

discussion no with will the clerk Pro

all
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
right all right um returning to the the
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
the the sentence School District
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
policies shall include shall not
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit student with disabilities that
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
sentence appears in both bills I mean
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
this actually become is a little is our
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
friend because it's in both bills so if
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to make any changes we may
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
as well as with the previous amend that
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
we have adopted uh it's going to pertain
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
to both the bills and Melissa you have
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
pointed to the language that you took
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
from the governor's budget
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
proposal and representative Hall you
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
felt it was import I heard you say it
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
was important that we
 
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.750 align:start position:0%
was important that we
include

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
medical um issues as well as elll
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
learners ELO support ELO Learners all
 
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.309 align:start position:0%
learners ELO support ELO Learners all
right

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
so is there a preference for retaining
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
the language in the bills as
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
introduced is there a preference for
 
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.990 align:start position:0%
introduced is there a preference for
changing

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
it let's just start with that question
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
does does do either of you want to just
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
go with the language that's in the
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
bills you do no are you saying end it
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
with 504 and not have the medical and
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
not have the ell do either of you want
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
to retain this language period that's it
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
without any change without any changes
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
but can we add a sentence after you well
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to that next because
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
because we're GNA say that we we don't
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
want this any longer as is so it's you
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
you do not you're not happy with that
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
sentence it does it's not inclusive
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
enough fine correct
 
00:43:57.559 --> 00:43:59.109 align:start position:0%
enough fine correct
representative

00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
meliss yes I agree that it should be I
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
agree so we're going to do something now
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
about the the third or what it is the
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
fourth s the last sentence okay we're
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
now we have the language from the
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.069 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
but we may as well open the whole can
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
here this Lang excuse me the first
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
sentence in the governor's
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
proposed language is identical to what
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
sentence instead of utilizing the word
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
restrict the word
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit is
 
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.549 align:start position:0%
prohibit is
used

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
correct such policy shall prohibit
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
personal device used by students during
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
the school day and be implemented
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
schoolwide with approved exceptions
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
determined by
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs which I think captures
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
or expresses the concerns representative
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
ago however there's
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
another bombshell in here because we're
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
now prohibiting rather than restricting
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we're prohibiting it during the
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
school day rather than just
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
during class
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
instruction where are we at right now
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
what line what number I'm sorry if
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at um I got this all
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
right so if you look if you look at the
 
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.630 align:start position:0%
right so if you look if you look at the
second

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
sentence such policy shall prohibit
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
personal device shall prohibit not
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
restrict restrict as in the bills
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit personal device used by
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
students during the school day and be
 
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.750 align:start position:0%
students during the school day and be
implemented

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
schoolwide with approved exception
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
determined that is the policy with
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
approved exceptions determined by
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.670 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
proficiency

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
needs such policy shall be developed in
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
collabor okay so how are how are you
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
with that sentence the first key
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
difference is prohibit rather than
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
restrict I I love the sentence I think I
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer to see the word
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
restrict versus prohibit but the rest of
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
the sentence I like it how do you feel
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
about that um I
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
think that now you're saying it must be
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
now you're not you're taking away local
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
control right now now you're saying
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
you're restricting cell phone or
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
prohibiting during the school day I mean
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
in essence that's what we're talking
 
00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
in essence that's what we're talking
about

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
but like some like different policies we
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
look at some of them were for this
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
school but not that school some of them
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
were you know the older kids could have
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
it during lunch but not this is saying
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
here you're prohibiting it during the
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
school day this means Bell to Bell right
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the bills the the prohibition or the
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
Restriction is during class instruction
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
only right all
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't say encourage it says
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
such policy shall restrict the use of
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
student personal cell phones during
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
class instruction without educator
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
approval right now the exception are
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
further down in the paragraph however
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're correct in in the governor's
 
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.430 align:start position:0%
you're correct in in the governor's
proposed

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
language the policy is during the entire
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
school day and schoolwide it is far more
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
restrictive and it is is far more
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
directive as to what the policy must
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
say we're basically if if we were to
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
adopt that sentence that language we
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be saying that all school
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state have to
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy that is schoolwide during
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
the entire school day B to Bell yep I
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
don't think I how do you feel about that
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
and milissa how do you feel about that I
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
think it should be local control let let
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
the local people decide how they're
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
going to handle it
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
that so I I personally think think it
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
should just be at a minimum if we want
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
to have local control sure but I think
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
at a minimum it should be we're saying
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
top down during class time no cell
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
phones they've had ample opportunity in
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
many years with local control to curb
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
this and it hasn't
 
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.829 align:start position:0%
this and it hasn't
happened

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing is that at the very
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
minimum we want to see that classroom
 
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.230 align:start position:0%
minimum we want to see that classroom
usage

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
usage
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
is being addressed and restricted
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
without directing school boards to tell
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
to include other portions of the school
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
day that's up to them what they do we're
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
not telling them that they can't make it
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
schoolwide and during the entire school
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
day but they must at
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
least they must at least restrict the
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
usage during classroom
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
time and representative Hall I heard you
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
say yeah I it tell me for yeah because
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
there should be local control as to
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's extended beyond the
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
classroom but did you AG agree with
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions with respect to classroom
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
usage and I heard you say the same
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield am I
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
correct uh maybe not hold on one second
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
yeah now remember we're going to get
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
into exceptions later on because we're
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to deal we're going to get into uh
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh exceptions for
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
individualized plans
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
504s uh English as a as a second
 
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.950 align:start position:0%
504s uh English as a as a second
language

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
and yeah I um medic no we don't need to
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
with the governor's Medical
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
with if we if if we if we don't in the
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed language if we don't
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
go with prohibit we go with restrict
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
let's just say for the moment all right
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't go with use by students
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
during the school day and be implemented
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
school whyde we could pick up the last
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
part of that sentence and add it to the
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
second to the second sentence that
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
already exists in the bill let me read
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
it if you refer to the bill either one
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
such policy shall restrict the use of
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
students personal cell phone use during
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
class instruction without educator
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
approval and with approved exceptions
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
determined by student medical disability
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
or language proficiency
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
needs I kind I back up for a minute that
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
sentence on on the two bills not the
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
governor's sentence such policy shall
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
00:51:52.789 --> 00:51:52.799 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class instruction
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
without educator approval that was also
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
one that we talked about getting rid of
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
that well wait wait I'm sorry we we uh
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
we we just got rid of that yeah we voted
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
to get rid of it well we voted to get
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
rid of recommend getting rid of the both
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
sentences two sentences there I'm sorry
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to do that we I believe it
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
I if no the third yeah what I had what I
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
had written down and I may have been
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect I wrote down that we would
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
take out districts are encouraged to
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
consider we didn't get rid of the second
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
S no I I would I would say in my opinion
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
um I like what you're saying you can do
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
a cut and pay yeah let's just remove the
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
without educator
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
approval such policy shall restrict the
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
use of student personal cell phones
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
during class
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
instructed with approved exceptions
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
determined by student medical disability
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
nice um I have to think on that one a
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
minute because I I know do we really
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
want cell phones being utilized in our
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
classes do we you know uh this there is
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
no demonstrated over
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
compelling benefit to students using
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
cell phones as a matter of fact if I'm a
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
student and I'm sitting in my favorite
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
row and chair towards the back of the
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
room where I can get away with most
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
anything and I'm supposed to be doing
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
thus and so and instead I'm on a porn
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
site well we have just provided for that
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
to occur because if individual Educators
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
want to utilize cell phones in the
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
classroom how will the educator
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not all of the
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
students are actually complying in
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
they're on the right website and for me
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
personally honestly we we talk about um
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
equality and I personally just look at
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
cell phones if an instructor is going to
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
say to the kids use your personal device
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
I personally feel talk about the Hales
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
and the Have Nots like there's a
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
disparity there I just I absolutely
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
don't agree with it if you want them
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
using technology then use the school
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
tech and and and what floes me too
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
though is we continue to hear well then
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
the schools have to have a onetoone
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
device per student really don't actually
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
for years we had carts with devices and
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
you bring it into the classroom with
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
what CS C carts so you could have a no
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
but seriously you could have a c was a
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
musical school no I'm dating myself here
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying if you really needed
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Chromebooks right you you have a
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
classroom of 25 or 30 kids then you have
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
the 30 Chromebooks and they can use it
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
during that class most Schools are they
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
are issuing the oneto one at this point
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
anyway but yeah were you did you just
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
say just get rid of without educator
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
approval yeah you say yeah yeah yeah
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's like I mean the rest of that
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
sentence I mean I think that's really
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
what this is about isn't it isn't this
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
about not using cell phones during class
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
right or
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely because then we then go on to
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
say after sentence one governing cell
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
student cell phone use such policy shall
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
during class
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
instruction all right yes okay comma
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
with approved exceptions determined by
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
student medical disability and language
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs Yes or
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
No Yes except that is line one
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
disability or language one two three do
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
you see the sentence halfway um do you
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
see the word with in line three four or
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
five words in yep adopting that language
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
with u co-opting that to this sentence
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
with approved exceptions determined by
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs who's
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
approving well that would be under the
 
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
approving well that would be under the
policy

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good question but do yeah let's
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
walk around that because we're saying
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
they have to have because it say they
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
shall they shall not prohibit students
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so I'm not sure who's
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
approving those exceptions I I would in
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
in my opinion many of the policies that
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
I've seen over time were um with the
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
approval of the superintendent or his
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
design so if that's the case because the
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
nurse could be the designate do you know
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
specify that who who gives the approval
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the exceptions no I think what if we
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have the word approved with
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions determined by student I mean
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
is if the school board is adopting a
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
policy aren't they the ones that are
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
going to we're telling them you must
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
make exceptions for these
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
people um it's it's the school board's
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
determine um whether or not the
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions are approved or not within
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
the area of areas of medical disability
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
or language proficiency
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
needs is it not their if it's their
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
policy aren't they the ones who
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
decide um whether there will be
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
exceptions based on these three
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
categories I I just I would get rid of
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
the word approved but I because I I just
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's GNA bring that question I'm the
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
parent I could I I could accept that I
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
could accept
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
getting yes because it's already the
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
school board that's adopting the policy
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
so why do we need it's almost redundant
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
right implemented School redundant with
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions determined by student medical
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
disability if the word is approved as
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
unnecessary what I think I think I see
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
that Melissa you're no it's fine I saw
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
you I saw you with that that I have this
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
link you know you know whenever I get
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
like I'm thinking I had that you're
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
thinking I do I have all right so I'm
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
going back to your thinking about the
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
mental health com they need pH for
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't see that happen
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's a mental health thing that's why
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing this to help their mental
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
health I just want to go in the weed a
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
little bit further because I'm looking
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
at policies from other I'm going to get
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
on my Soap Box a little bit but from
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
other states and for example a student
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
who is a member of a volunteer
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
firefighting organization or emergency
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
organization maybe authorized to carry a
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
device aren't they in school to be in
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
school like I don't understand well as I
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier legislators love to
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislate I mean it it's almost becomes
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
a form of Vatican casuistry I mean you
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
know they have have a word in in a
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
restriction or whatever cover everything
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
under the sun right you know or the or
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
the talet you know everything is
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
covered I'm prepare I'm ready to ask you
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
whether you're willing to retain the
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
language beginning on line four such
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
policies shall restrict the use of
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
student personal cell phones during
 
00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.230 align:start position:0%
student personal cell phones during
class

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
instruction excuse me but
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating so therefore we don't need
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
to take any action but
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating the the words without
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
educator approval placing a comma after
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
the word instruction at the end of line
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
four and replacing it with the language
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposed language with
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
approved exceptions we can lift that
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
with approved exception C determined by
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry with
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions with exceptions
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
determined by student medical disability
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
or language proficiency needs and we we
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
just lift that language we steal it we
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
put it in
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
here all right so we will need a motion
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
effect that the last three
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
words in the sentence
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
that begins on line
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
four be
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
struck the sentence that begins on line
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
four okay the last three
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
words shall be struck and replaced
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
with quote with exceptions determined by
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
student medical disability or language
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
quote Yeah I'm just going back to were
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
approve for a second well you want to
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of it have you changed your mind
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm I'm asking question you
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
have that you have that prerogative no
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is this let's
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
say I've got a kid in my
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
class is this I'm I'm actually wondering
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
why the word approve was there I'm just
 
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
why the word approve was there I'm just
wondering

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
why my gut tells me it didn't need to be
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
there but is there a
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
situation where well what's the opposite
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
of appr approved unapproved can you have
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
a disapproved
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
exception how can you not have an
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
exception unless it's approved I I
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
personally don't disagree with having
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
approved I just think that you need to
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
put approved by whom and that's why I we
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
we we have have yeah yeah you're you're
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
you're actually prompted to have to do
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
something with approved by yeah that
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's the whole you keep if you retain
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
approved if you take it away you don't
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to do that okay let's take it away
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
I'm good so do you need a motion
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
did you get did you get what I said I do

but did that give the parents the power
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
to push the except I'm I personally I
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%

you might have an assistant
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent and and that's the
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the so are you okay
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
designate a problem have to be I don't
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
wondering so you're in a class and the
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%

you know oh wait minut you can't use
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
that phone I guess I'm just thinking the
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
process like who's gonna well who's
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to police a disability is GNA is a
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
disability only going to be for a day
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
right is a language proficiency issue
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
going to be only for a day no is a
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
medical issue exactly going to be
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
longterm or could it also be shortterm
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then you got to to get the
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent or his
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
Design's approval in order to have a
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
medical exception for somebody with a
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
need and is that is that a big deal it's
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
not a big deal they do it all the time
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
so approved by superintendent or his or
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
his or her designate yeah right did you

spoke I I didn't include the word
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
approved so now we got approved with
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
exception with approved
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
and then you don't want to use by again
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%

okay I'm gonna have to go type all this
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
as soon as we get back okay uh we need
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
consensus on this no all right yeah a
 
01:04:53.359 --> 01:04:56.269 align:start position:0%
consensus on this no all right yeah a
motion

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
you got you you the chair typically
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't make motions in my world so yeah
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
you got who wants to go who wants to
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
make the motion you wanna you want to
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's your turn Melissa you want to do
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
that okay and then rep you got a
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
second okay is is our motion our motion
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.910 align:start position:0%
second okay is is our motion our motion
is

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
twofold and that is well in two parts
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're Parts we're eliminating okay the
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
words at the end of this first of the
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
sentence beginning on line four and
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
ending on line five that is without
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
educator approval right and we are
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
inserting okay so we are looking at the
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
bills in front of us right now and
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
beginning on line four such policy shall
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class instruction we
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
are going to keep that we are going to
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
remove the three words without educator
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
educator Comm put a comma and insert the
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
words and then we're going to insert the
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
words um with approved with approved ex
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%

by super superintendent or his her
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
design with respect to student medical
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
disability or language proficiency needs
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
perfect long sentence I think you just
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
made the motion perfect oh I have to
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
again I'll second it right now to put
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
that in langage uh anything more to be
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
said we're basically doing one sentence
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
every half hour here I know all in favor
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh would you call the role please yes
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall yes
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative witfield is yes and
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay we've already gotten rid of the
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
third sentence Oh by and would you also
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh could we agree by consensus that that
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
that that that motion is with respect to
 
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.950 align:start position:0%
that that that motion is with respect to
both

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
bills yeah all right with respect to
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
both bills HB 781 FM and HB 131 okay ask
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
a question about procedure so is it our
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
role to come up with an amendment our
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
role okay let's say we come up with an
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
amendment then it goes to the committee
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
right and then the
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee the
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
committee discusses the amendment and
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
then we vote on the amendment and
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
someone can amend the amendment if they
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to is that correct
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
so what we can do here is we can make
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full committee
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
okay those recommendations can just be
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations or they can be formally
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
offered as amendments an amendment okay
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
and when we make the recommendations
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
we're making
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations as amendments then
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
formally somebody would have to draft
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
draft the amendment and put his or her
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
name on it okay right that sounds good
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
that in a more formal sense
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you would we we could vote to adopt
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
amendment number but we're not okay
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
we're nowhere near having an adopted an
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
amendment number assigned yet all
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
now I believe what we have is
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard shall develop and adopt a
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
policy governing student cell phone use
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
in schools such policy shall restrict
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
the use of student personnel personal
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class
 
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.309 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class
instruction

01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
comma with exceptions determined by the
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent and his or her
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
designate with respect to student
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
medical disability or language
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs can I make a
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion and if it's well let me just
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
conclude by saying if in
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
fact if in fact that we do that
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
then we need to look at whether we need
 
01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:30.269 align:start position:0%
then we need to look at whether we need
to

01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
to
actually

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we can retain the language that
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
school district's policy shall not
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with disabilities from
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
using a device to support their learning
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
we can go so far as to say that in
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
addition to as identified by their
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
IEPs plan developed under Section 504
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah blah or when
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
required to support emergent
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
multilingual students with appropriate
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
language access programs and services
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
pursuing to title six of the Civil
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
Rights Acts of 1964 that language could
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
be could could be uh inserted in both
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
bills okay and that does not change
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
anything that we've
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
already decided here to recommend okay
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
agree um if we could go back and just
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
make that sentence which sentence the
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
the big long one that we just we just
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
approved yes can make that two sentences
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
saying the exact same thing you know
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
just exceptions may I I can't see it in
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
front of me right now but no content is
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
changed on well the way to do that is to
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
say such policy shall restrict the use
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
of student Personnel cell phones during
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:42.709 align:start position:0%
of student Personnel cell phones during
class

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
instruction period y
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions may be
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
determined by the superintendent and his
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
or her
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
design with respect to student with
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
respect to student medical disability or
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
language proficiency needs that that
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
makes it two sent we got careful with
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
the May it's not a bad sentence when you
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
look at it in when you look at it can I
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
just show it to her yes isn't this why
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
we have lawyers let me see yeah and I
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
like that there too in Cas can you live
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
with that oh up here I'm not okay wait
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
I know I went to school where you were
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to use a lot of just imp
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
imperative sentences and not have a lot
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
and the other way you could do it end it
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
right here and say approved exceptions
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
shall be determined by the blah blah
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
blah BL but leave it like that for now
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
somebody in the other room can decide
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
any approved exceptions do do you want
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
to do you want well let's do as much as
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
we can here do we want two sentences or
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
one you think the sent look long that's
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
your shall restrict the use of student
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
personal cell phones during class
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
instruction comma with the approved
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
exceptions determined by the
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent his or her design with
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
respect to student medical disability or
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
Lang it looks good that doesn't look too
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
excessive for me in my in my world and
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the queen of commas and
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
short the first part I think you have
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
one word too many there restrict the use
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
of student personal cell phones during
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
CL instruction are we I just as I think
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
about that are we telling the school
 
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
about that are we telling the school
districts

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
um you need to focus on classroom
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
instruction because really what we're
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're hoping they're going to do more
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
than that right um but by saying you
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
shall do this are we letting them know
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
Well you want to insert the words such
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
policy shall restrict the use of student
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
Personnel cell phones at least during
 
01:12:44.639 --> 01:12:46.950 align:start position:0%
Personnel cell phones at least during
class

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
instruction remember we didn't want to
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
go school wide in school whole school
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
day let's leave it yeah um let's leave
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
it like it is for right now I'm going to
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
say I mean you are sending a message
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
least but if you're saying you shall
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
you're also sending the message they're
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
not going to be used during class so I
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
think I'm okay with the way that is and
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking other schools may say no
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can't do it during lunch because
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
some of those policies we looked at the
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
high school kids could use them during
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
lunch but the middle schoolers couldn't
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the same district so we do want to
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
give them some leeway and what they're
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing well and we do that with the word
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
Shell at least but we don't have to have
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
at least I think I think leave it as it
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
all right I can live with
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
that do do you think that school boards
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
might misread this and think that we're
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
telling them that we want them to
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of cell phones by
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
students only during the school
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
instruction time I'd have to I'd have to
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
see the whole thing when we have the
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
whole thing drafted get one more look at
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
it in writing and to see how I would
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
interpret that I'm
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
not um because we are saying minimally
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
you that I think that's the message
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're giving you minimally they can't be
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
used during class time right is that the
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
message we're
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
giving right like well I forget what's
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
written that so I mean that's what it
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
says it it doesn't it doesn't the
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
language of the first two sentences does
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit further restrictions
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
right but it could be
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
read and interpreted as this is what
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
they this is all that they mean they
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
only want us to do this for school
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
instruction or they're only requiring us
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
to do it for school in instruction and
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
they really don't want us to do anything
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to touch it with a
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
10-foot pole the state is that's what
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state is saying but if you say at
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
least then you're hinting that this is
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
the minimal standard that must be
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
adopted in the
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
policy correct I don't I'm not asking
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
you to approve that but that that that
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
is a correct analysis isn't it at least
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
and and then it and then it becomes hint
 
01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.310 align:start position:0%
and and then it and then it becomes hint
hint

01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
hint
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
suggestive you you know you you should
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
be doing more than this have you ever
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
seen an RSA with the words at least
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I take I haven't I'm and it
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
could exist I'm just throwing it out
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
there I think we're okay with the way it
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
is they shall like Clash instruction
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
when I'm thinking about we here in
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
another year or two if if we're still
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
here that um we got problems because the
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
policies only pertain to CL usage and we
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
got terrible stuff going on in the
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
lunchrooms and the school board didn't
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
see fit to put that and then they blame
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
us because we didn't put it in the
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
language of the
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
RSA then we go back and say okay well we
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
fix that now
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
we'll say playground in school lunch
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
period or whatever we want to do this is
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
nothing that says that we
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
can't run it by anybody else who run
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
what by them well I don't know like I
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
would love to run some of this by
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton to be like you know is
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
she's seen that type of working before
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
it does it make sense well you could put
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
at least in and then just strike it okay
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
the committee could then strike it I I
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we should you want to have
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
do we want to have a discussion at the
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee level as to whether we insert
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
the words at least or do you want to
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
have a discussion at the committee level
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not we we we strike the
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
words at least I would say go in without
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
words at
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
least and just I have that discussion
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
those are kind of we are opening a can
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
of worms then because then if anybody
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
raises that question then then we have
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
to start talking about at least or what
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
what other you know similar language
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
it's EAS to my way of think it's easier
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
to strike words than it is to insert
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
them they still you know this is not
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
your you know your final vote I know
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
that how about it
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
brainstorming um such a policy shall
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
instruction and we throw out something
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
like and other times is deemed
 
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
like and other times is deemed
appropriate

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
by I don't know if we say the
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
administration or whatever but should
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
we well now now we're going to have to
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
have two sentences because if we start
 
01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:18.430 align:start position:0%
have two sentences because if we start
adding

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
on I asking now you got a runaway train
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
here but I think you know if the three
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
of us can agree on content on on intent
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes right I mean that's a huge thing
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
that's and I think we are agreeing on
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
intent well that that's a big part of
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
our task and that's why I'm thinking I
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
mean that's what the chair is yeah
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
hoping and Desiring comes out of this so
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
I mean the same P this is viewed this is
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
viewed as being a
 
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.350 align:start position:0%
viewed as being a
consensus

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
issue and and and not not
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
partisan uh um we all recognize this is
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
a huge problem and we need to do
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
something so if we come out of here with
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations that potentially should
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
carry a lot of weight with the rest of
 
01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.310 align:start position:0%
carry a lot of weight with the rest of
the

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee and that's that's the thinking
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
here put the three best brains on the
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee in this room to see what can
 
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.149 align:start position:0%
committee in this room to see what can
come

01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
up all right are you
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
laughing I think um I didn't even know
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
you guys are there so so let go back to
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
way back there's laughing gas in the
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
back of the room it's coming out of the
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
way back when we talked about oh I hope
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go back and do things
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
we already we do well when we say during
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
class instruction me mean we're we're
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
setting them up and that's why I said
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
initially if you got rid of that
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentence it would be such policy shall
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of students personal
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
period okay
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
and then the exception then the
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
exception I mean well yes because then
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is you're throwing the
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
door open to you're saying you you got
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
to come up with when you're going to do
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
this and where and you know there's not
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
a district that's not going to start
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
with classroom instruction there's not a
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
one that that that's that that that
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
appears to make a lot of sense to me
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
Melissa does that to you not
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
yet can you repeat that such policy
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
shall restrict the use of student
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
Personnel cell
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
phones during school time MH during
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
school it just said cell phone use in
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools it just said that so okay so we
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
don't need to do that such policy shall
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
personal cell phones in school okay in
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
schools and then um well we don't need
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
to say we don't need the sentence at all
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
right the whole sentence well what about
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
W with approved exceptions determined by
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
student Medical well that has to happen
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
but let's say if you got rid of like I
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
said first I don't know why I went back
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
well well first of all the word
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
governing appears in the
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
first then the word restrict appears in
 
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
first then the word restrict appears in
sentence

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
two there's a difference between
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
governing and
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
restricting you can be very permissive
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
in your
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
restricting School Board shall develop
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
and adopt a policy restricting student
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
cell phone use in schools then it goes
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
right down
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
to the school district policy shall not
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit no no sorry up above here
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
um what was the next sentence we had
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
Melissa such policy shall be developed
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
in no no school district policy shall
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
not prohibit students with disabilities
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
so we go right from there like you got
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
to develop a policy and then you go
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
right into these are the exceptions that
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
you need do you know what's interesting
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
is consistently both the two bills and
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's wording all have a policy
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
governing they all have that wording
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
well that's because we're the government
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
we like the government just
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
initially can we can we ask these folks
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
if there's a difference between restri
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
governing you you could have both words
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
governing and
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
restricting can I ask a question I'm
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
just curious yes do you guys have a
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
difference between governing and
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
restricting if I said School Board shall
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt a policy governing
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
student cell phone use or restricting
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
would that be inclusive of restrictive
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
but not think a
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
rest is
 
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.550 align:start position:0%
rest is
part

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes could governance you can p out yes
 
01:21:58.199 --> 01:21:59.310 align:start position:0%
yes could governance you can p out yes
that's

01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
right governance is this restriction is
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
this restriction is a subset of
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
governing but our following sentence
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
says the word sh say it states shall
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
restrict well if you retain governing in
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
the first sentence and then you put
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
restriction in sentence two then the
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
governance must include that
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
restriction okay that works isn't it so
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
well do we still have during class
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
instruction or do we we going to take
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
that away I say take it away I make a
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
motion that we take away during class
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
instruction because that way it opens it
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
up we know they're going to do it during
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
class because they can do that and they
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
they can do even more like my my my
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
grandson's school district and mass that
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
said goodbye that no cell phones
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere on the school grounds the whole
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
day okay and they have high proficiency
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
scores by the way but who knows causal
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
relationship contributing
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right right but we weren't even
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable we removed the wording where
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
um we had use um during instruction when
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
an educator is using devices as part of
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
a lesson plan we took that away we took
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
that away but my point is
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to get even I feel as
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
though we're getting looser by taking
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
away during class instruction I think
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
we're getting
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
stronger I'm not seeing it the reason
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
thinking that if you have a cell phone
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
policy okay on the school board the very
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
first thing you're going to do is you're
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
going to you're going to address class
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
time that there's no way you're gonna
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
say you can't have them at lunch you
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
class do do you do you I don't agree
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
with that because agree we so I I just
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
know that for example um we had a
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
warrant article in our district which is
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
a very large District at one point
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of um electronic
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
devices and the way that that I saw it
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
implemented was it was lunch in free
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
time I didn't necessarily see it during
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
classroom because they may need it
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
during class time I I am not comfortable
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
at all with what we're
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying representative Hall I I think
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
what you're you're you're doing here uh
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't mean to be um at all critical
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
but I I think what you're doing is
 
01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.030 align:start position:0%
but I I think what you're doing is
you're

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
assuming that the views that you hold
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
and that we share with you you are going
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
to be universally held by those in
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
positions to restrict cell phone student
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
cell phone use and I'm wondering if we
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
want to have an opening that
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
huge because you're you're not going to
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
be the Super you're not going to be the
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
school board of every school district
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
and neither am I in the state of New
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where that view would be
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
honestly if they were to go with a pouch
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
system I think it would be easier for
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
them to restrict the cell phone use for
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
longer periods of time otherwise the
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
kids need to have access to the magnets
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
Etc you
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
know storage them go out and get a grant
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
and and if they want to do that I
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
understand there's money for this sort
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
of thing and so I'm okay I don't
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with the sentence such policy
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
shall restrict the use of student
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
personal cell phones during class
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
instruction I agree with that sentence
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
Did we keep that we kept it we kept it I
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
had said during class instruction and we
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
were talking about Shell at least
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned that it may
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well so if this is the first time
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
in the history of the state of New
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the words at least have
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
included in RSA then we all will become
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
oford how about a minimum
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
how about at a minimum at a minimum
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
sounds higher class yes at a
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
minimum it it it sounds loftier it's
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
more uh uh Barrister friendly so let's
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
go with that yes so suppose you put that
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
put it for now such
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh such policy shall
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
restrict such policy shall at a minimum
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
or you you you could begin with at a
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
minimum such policy where I don't where
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
do you want to put it that was such
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
policy such policy yes policy shall at a
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
minimum restrict the use of student
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone during class
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
instruction and then with the phrase
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
that we the Clause that we robbed from
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget the policy sh at a
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
minimum restrict is that you want me to
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
the policy sh at a minimum restrict
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of okay so you got the
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
rest of it I do except for I I want to
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
clarify something please you want to
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
read the whole sentence and then we can
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
tell you what we think sure good uh the
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
policy shall at a minimum resp restrict
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
the use of student personal cell phones
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
during class instruction with the
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
approved exceptions determined by the
 
01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh not the approved but
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
with approved not the approved we don't
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
want to say the approved with approved
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions I'm glad that we're reading
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
this okay with approved exceptions
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
determined by the superintendent or his/
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
her design with respect to student
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
medical disability or language
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs yes okay
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
now um are we am I going directly down
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
to school dist adding in school district
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
policy shall not prohibit students with
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities from using or I know there
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
was sentence or two before that and I
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if I was to use that or not
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
the okay so the such policy shall be
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
developed in um collaboration with any
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
applicable local education striking that
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
sentence correct yeah strike it okay I'm
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
sorry which I'm sorry what are we
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
striking here from the governor's um
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
under after well why don't we go back to
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
781 and uh 131 because now now we're
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
down to the last sentence School
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
District policy shall not prohib
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
students or yes or we can go what's in
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
view on the Blackboard right now is that
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
sentence or this one from the governor's
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
proposal Which is far more detailed the
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
me all right so here's what we're saying
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
if we retain this language if we retain
 
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.550 align:start position:0%
if we retain this language if we retain
this

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
language then we've already said that
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
there are approved exceptions by the
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
school superintendent or his or her
 
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.750 align:start position:0%
school superintendent or his or her
designate

01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
designate
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh medical disability or
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
language proficiency needs but then we
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
are becoming even more but we are
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
becoming very specific in
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
saying in case you don't understand this
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
school district policy shall not
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with disability so
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
we've already been identified as as
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
being um in the category of may have
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions you're saying as a broadly
 
01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
speaking School District policy shall
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
not prohibit students with disabilities
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
so do I believe believe that that
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
creates problems no do I believe do I I
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
find that to be perfectly fine and and
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
we could include that uh I would say yes
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
unless I am shown the light in a
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
different direction okay so are you okay
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
with that the first part well the first
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
sentence on on the governor right the
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
first sentence um to the last sentence
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
now I know you are but let to start with
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
the first sentence um you just ref it's
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
reference students medical disability
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
and language proficiency needs yes down
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
to the last sentence School District
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
policy shall not prohibit students
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about medical there um
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if medical you know
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
what I mean so they that sentence there
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
elaborates on what is a disability and
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
what is the language proficiency needs
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't I think it needs to say
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
something about medical like just to
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
give an example like add the um I got it
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
here somewhere
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
well are is medical included in the
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of
 
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
1973 not the not9 USC so you're going to
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to separate the two
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
and say this and this but on medical it
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
could say let me see
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
um just do an EG for example glucose
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
sensors or insulin pumps or something
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
just letting them know what are we
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
talking about medical needs I mean I
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
think they I think I heard in that room
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
our committee that that needed to be
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
spelled out to give examples so such
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
District policy shall not prohibit
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
students with medical needs EG glucose
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
monitor pumps y do yep and students with
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities from using a so you're
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're so we insert
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
that right School District policy shall
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
not prohibit students with
 
01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.830 align:start position:0%
not prohibit students with
medical

01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
needs such as or for example glucose
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
monitor pumps
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
whatever what's the other one and and
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
and monitor and what else did I see here
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
insulin pumps insulin pumps okay put a
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
parenthesis around that for example EG
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
comma insulin pumps or glucose
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices can we back up excuse
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
me exactly where does that for example
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
go okay sorry do you see the governor's
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
proposed language yeah School District
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
policy shall not prohibit yeah School
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%

01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
pumps and glucose sensors
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
glucose sens what are they called
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
glucose sensors sensors close
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
or or or with
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
support their
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
learning according to this the language
 
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:47.800 align:start position:0%

01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just going to read it back um
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
School District policy shall not
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with medical needs
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
parentheses EG insulin pumps and glucose
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%

01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%

01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
learning as identified by their
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
individualized education plan um plan
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
developed under Section 504 of The
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 29 USC 794 or
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
when required to support emergent
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
multilingual students with appropriate

language access programs and services
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
pursuant to um Title 9 of the Civil
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
Rights Act of
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
1964 that's good you not like
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I was on the wrong you moved
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
it down here instead of up there right
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
that stayed the same up here do you want
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
to look at it's it's it's it's the it's
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
the next sentence now yeah yeah and I
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
was thinking it's be in that let me
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's the it's the it's the new
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
third sentence in the second paragraph
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
5 okay
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
so we're approaching Perfection here but
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
we have to remember that Perfection
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
should not be the enemy of the almost
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
perfect I mean with all with the three
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
of us and all the time we've spent of
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
course it's close to perfect but can I I
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
I think we need
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
to go back go back go back to the very
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
beginning when we're talking about cell
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
phones are we okay with adding cell
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
phones including smart watches including
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't we want to just say personal what
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
about personal electronic devices
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
communication devices or personal
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
electronic devices to which could
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
include smart you know smart watches
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
airpods I always say earbuds airpods yes
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean so I mean I think we need to
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
include those personal electronic either
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
communicate do they all are they allun
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
they don't all communic well can you
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
have communication there only one oh yes
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
them so what's the phrase that captures
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
devices perfect because personal
 
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:36.390 align:start position:0%
devices perfect because personal
electronic

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
devices yeah oh I like that electronic
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
communication devices communicating
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's the whole right that's what other
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
policies had I I didn't make this up I
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
actually saw it in other policies that
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
well I've seen that too yeah it madees
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
sense to me and and quite honestly I
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
would say that I would anticipate that
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
that would come up in the committee if
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
we don't deal with this right now so if
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
we go back to the first
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
sentence in section five such P such
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
School Board shall develop and adopt a
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
policy governing student cell phone or
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
do we just want to say and personal can
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
and I've got such policy may also
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
include okay so let's go school board BL
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
blah sh development policy governing
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
access okay in schools such policy may
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
also include the use of other personal
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
electronic communication devices such as
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
airpods I mean do we want to specify
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
smart watches an airpod or just leave it
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
why why do we need to don't they already
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
know what personal Comm communication
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
devices no they don't know glass no they
 
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.510 align:start position:0%
devices no they don't know glass no they
don't

01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
know have you identified those in your
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
so I I like the idea of if we actually
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
say student cell phone and then we say
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
other or have
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
including including personal electronic
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
and other why don't we just say cell
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
phones and other personal electronic
 
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.990 align:start position:0%
phones and other personal electronic
communication

01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
devices I'm
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
getting like which may
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
include that's right exactly that's
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
right exactly okay that's right can you
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
imagine what something's going to be
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
called two or three years from there and
 
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
then they're going to say well they it's
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
like the the bill that wanted the the
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
book had to be on a flash drive what who
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
uses flash drive or you know you have to
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
watch a certain
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
book okay can we pause for one moment
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
please so um this is going to did we
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
adopt the did we did we finally adopt
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
this did we have a vote on the second
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
one not yet Amendment you mean the big
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
sentence yes no we didn't can we hold
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
back because I I don't want to get too
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
far ahead here we're ready to go with
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
this but we have to take care of the
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
other the previous why don't may I make
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
a suggestion um although going to need
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
help with this wording it's it's
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
literally a paragraph do you want to
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
just take a vote on the whole thing
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
versus sentence by
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
sentence because we've done this peace
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
meal this is a good question in in my
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
humble opinion uh this is a good
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
question so when we when we fix this
 
01:38:45.639 --> 01:38:47.070 align:start position:0%
question so when we when we fix this
last

01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
sentence which is the first sentence
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually because we're going to put
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
other electronic devices then what we
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
can do is we can make a
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the previous
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
three uh that that this replaced the
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
previous three so we don't actually have
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
to report the previous three because
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a an entirely new
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph consisting of the three
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
sentences now we've done this one at a
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
time but yes having effectively dealt
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman five
 
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.589 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman five
we

01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
can we can do a replace remove and
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
replace and once we take care of voting
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
second recommendation and then
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
apparently a third recommendation that
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
has just appeared at the 11th hour and
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
that is that we say cell
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
phone and other personal electronic
 
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.910 align:start position:0%
phone and other personal electronic
communication

01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
devices but let's get let's let's take
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
one and then we'll take do the next one
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
by the way we got about 15 minutes here
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
before EXA one um can I ask are we going
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
to our recommendation would that this
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
should be public schools and Charter
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
Public Charter Schools we can deal with
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
that we can deal with that as as
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
separate and yes we can do that okay all
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
right so but we're in agreement with
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
that that's what I want to know yes okay
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay so School Board sh I want to run
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
the sense by yes that's what has to
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
happen next please okay School Board
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
shall develop and adopt a policy
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
governing student cell phone use and
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
personal electronic communication
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
devices in schools all right but we have
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
to come back to that because we still
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
haven't voted on the other one yet that
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
this the sentence includes with the long
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
sentence I think we could do it all did
 
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
you did did we vote on that do you have
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
a vote on that sentence well we've
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
already had two votes well then we did
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we did we voted on that so now we
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
can vote on this okay before we do um
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just bring up school board
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
shall develop and we had discussed this
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
early on but do we want to say Implement
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
versus adopt a policy School Board shall
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement a policy well
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
first they have to adopt
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
it shall develop adopt and Implement no
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
just develop and
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
adopt well if if if a school is going to
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt a policy you would
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
think they would also be implementing it
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
rather than not putting into it but I
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
mean why do you adopt a policy if you're
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything with it but
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's up to them well that's up to them
 
01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
that's up to them well that's up to them
us

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
right okay but you know me like I even
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
consequences yeah I don't think should
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
be you don't foresee any difficulties if
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
if we do not use the word were to
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
implement because you believe that if
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
policies are if we direct that they be
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
adopted that they will in fact be
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
implemented and that we're not going to
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
be sitting here a year from now saying
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
well they didn't implement it because
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah am I you're going to be in
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
57 okay yeah this is like a Sub sub
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
meeting over here I know this is far
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
worse than a
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
cus yes
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry all right School Board
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
shall develop we voted the first we
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
voted the second now we've got a
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
replace the first sentence with the
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
following sentence such board shall
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt a policy governing
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
and other personal electronic
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
communication device usage in schools
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
you want the word other personal I have
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
and personal all right and read what you
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
have you start read it sounds school
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
boards shall develop and adopt a policy
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
governing student cell phone use and
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
personal electronic communication
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
devices in
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
schools the policy shall at a minimum
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
cell phones during class instruction
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
with approved exceptions determined by
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or his or her
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
designate with respect to student
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
medical disability or language
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs then it goes on to say
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
school district policy shall not
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with medical needs and
 
01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.709 align:start position:0%
prohibit students with medical needs and
the

01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities I think the very it should
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
say which may include the smart watches
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
do we want to do we have to and I those
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
are personal communication devices but
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't want to go there maybe
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
what if a what if a school district
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go into they can say that
 
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.229 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go into they can say that
they're

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
exempting ex you're by not identifying
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
the device you're you're you're not
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
saying that that device cannot be uh
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
utilized yeah you're just saying other
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
okay you identifying cell phones and
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
saying you cannot
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
evade doing something about cell phones
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
you can't evade this but other personal
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
devices are ones that you as a school
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
board will have to specify but doesn't
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
that say and what does it say in the
 
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
first sentence
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
sh and shall develop and okay School
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
Board shall develop and adopt a policy
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
governing student cell phone use and
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
personal electronic communication
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
devices theyve got to include the
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
personal in there they need to okay
 
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um because you can respond back and
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
forth to
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
text so do we
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
really so School Board should develop an
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy governing School cell
 
01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh okay we do need to say in schools
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
because it's the first sentence all
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
right oh wait a minute I'm sorry in
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
public and Charter
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
Schools uh is that school doesn't I mean
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
charter school doesn't have a school
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
board right they have a board of
 
01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
directors oh shoot okay Board of
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
Trustees so that's why you gota be we
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
bodies a school board is a governing
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
body a Board of Trustees is a governing
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
School governing bodies would that would
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
that I do
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
well he's doing that what you know every
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
school has a governing
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
body I just want to make sure that we've
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
got medical disability and language
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
those are all down here you know what I
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
mean we identify or Board of Trustees of
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Charter Schools down here
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
like I think it would be great if we
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
could just do the three here and Define
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
them down here um all right so the
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that we indeed be specific
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
rather than use the term governing
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
bodies we say school boards or of Tres
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
or Board of Trustees of char of a
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
chartered public school okay so wait so
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
School boards or the Board of
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
Trustees of Chartered public well no
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%

01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
shall develop and adopt a policy
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
governing student cell phone use in
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
schools okay so um school boards okay is
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%

Charter Public Schools no no right okay
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%

01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
Trustees of Chartered Public Schools
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%

01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
governing student c phone use and
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
personal electronic commun communication
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
devices in schools
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
well the word
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%

phone or personal the use get phone use
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%

on the
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%

word I mean use is okay but it sounds
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
like cell phone use I think or

01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
right well then you got and the use of
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean you to I thought of
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
that I just said was the TR was red yeah
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%

01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
phone and personal can't way over there
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
though even about the use of govern
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
about the cellon how about the usages
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
the usages of scho of the usages of
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%

01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
student cell phones and other electronic
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
personal communication devices cell
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
phone is singular so you got us are you
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
okay with usages it's not a very pretty
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
word how about the use of the use of all
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
right use of use of personal student
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%

and other personal electronic
 
01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
communication devices in schools okay
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right yeah that works get the word
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
you those other things was hanging do
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
you actually have that I do but I have I
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
do I do have two more questions so
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
before we all right before we vote on
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
that sentence Oh no we can vote on the
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
sentence can we vote on the
 
01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:18.149 align:start position:0%
sentence can we vote on the
sentence

01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
so yes but I'm just going to read you
 
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
that and that will be before we vote on
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
entirely move and replace I'm still I'm
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
still baffled that we have to vote on
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
Senate for Sen and we did
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
the on well because we didn't know how
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
far we were going to go with this it is
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
now clear that since we have torn the
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph apart that we're going
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
to do a removing replace and that's the
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
only thing that we're going to have to
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
report to to the committee not that we
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
did this this this and we don't have to
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
do a play byplay okay in my view what
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do is ultimately we're gonna
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna send one recommendation
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the full committee it's a remove and
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
replace paragraph Roman 5 with the
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
following language okay yep so we need
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
to vote on that sentence and then we can
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
vote on the remove and replace all right
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
School boards or the Board of Trustees
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
of Charter Public Schools shall develop
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
and adopt a policy governing the use of
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
student cell phones and personal
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
sorry it's okay I just didn't want
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
to okay the use okay school boards or
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees of Charter Public
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%

01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and other personal electronic
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you need to read the
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
sentence back just because you changed
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
the word or to and
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
Bute do we have a do we have a motion on
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
that so moved second it moved and
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
seconded all in favor I'm sorry you got
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
to call the rooll okay representative
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hall yes representative witfield is yes
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
replace which will be the reportable
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh now and then the final one
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
is we have we have to decide what we're
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to do with the date and then we
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
have to decide what we're going to do
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
with these bills and the appropriation
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
you guys don't want an appropriation do
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
you no I I just think it's premature
 
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.390 align:start position:0%
you no I I just think it's premature
well

01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
so chairman cordelli has recommended
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
that once we finish all of our word
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
smithing here today
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
that we recommend that the early Bill be
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
retained that preserves it and we don't
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
have to act on that
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill his preference is that we continue
 
01:52:10.350 --> 01:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
to give the full committee an
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with both the bills
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and decide what they want to
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
do so regardless we can make a
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation but that's that is his
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
reference that we do not choose one of
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
these two bills and say we recommend
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill over the other bill because
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
identical and we we we kick it upstairs
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
where that decision should be made
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
upstairs meaning the full committee
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
made so we have we have two three things
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
to do here two or three we're going to
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
remove and replace with all of these
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
changes and it's it'll be a new five so
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
a motion to the effect that we remove
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
and replace section
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
five uh Roman
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
five with the previous
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
changes then gets us a clean paragraph
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
to send
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
over can you
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
will read the whole thing just the whole
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
thing as is right now it should be right
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
now this is what we're going to send to
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%

1964 that's it is there a motion to
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
adopt that as the remove and replace
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
language for Roman five I don't know
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
whose turn it is sure so moved okay
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
second okay further discussion oh ready
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%

01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous um just to keep this clean I'm
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that we
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
resend the um actions that we took with
 
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
respect to the of the first three votes
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
we can just get rid of those now because
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
we've already done this so if I could
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
have a motion to the effect that we
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
resend the actions that we took with
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
respect to all
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
previous um um actions previous to the
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the motion to remove and replace I
 
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
make a motion is there a second I'll
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
second are we ready to vote okay
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative Hall yes
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative litfield yes yes
 
01:55:51.069 --> 01:55:51.079 align:start position:0%

01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
so do we want to do anything with the
 
01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:58.910 align:start position:0%
so do we want to do anything with the
effective

01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
dates um one is 60 days the other is
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 if we vote
 
01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:07.719 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:56:07.719 --> 01:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
to uh
retain

01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
131 no uh 781 FN we don't really need to
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
bother with that that is something that
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
the full committee can do fairly easily
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
is determine what date it wants can I
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
ask um see if it makes a difference
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
um Barett with respect to July one or
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
days you know say 60 days after
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.079 --> 01:56:50.030 align:start position:0%

01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah poliy to that
 
01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
yeah poliy to that

Association

01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
jcy process
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.239 --> 01:57:47.669 align:start position:0%
 
don't

01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
January definitely make that 9 days
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
little I can't imagine that this is
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
going to get signed into law very very
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
late I would expect that it would be
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
signed into law it govern so 60 days is
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to give you plenty of
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
date I mean I just suggest I I
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
personally think we should keep it clean
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it should be either implemented
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the first day of school or the
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of the second semester of the
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
school year because this is going to be
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a huge culture shock I
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
don't think like let's say mid- October
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense do you know what I'm saying
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think it should be a clean
 
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.870 align:start position:0%
I think it should be a clean
cut

01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
cut
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
but but but once again we had the
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
discussion you know hours
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
ago um the actual take effect on such
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
and such a date that doesn't mean the
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
policy is going to go into effect on
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
that date because that's the date when
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
the school boards are notified that they
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
have to do this so they have to be given
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient time in order to develop and
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
to uh adopt the policy so we want to we
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
want an earlier date rather than a later
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
date because it's already going to take
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
policy effective after that's fine but
 
01:59:25.069 --> 01:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
not to undo the work but you say by
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
January 2026 shall have well no but
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
before you came we we we we put an X
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
through that okay right I'm just tell
 
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.229 align:start position:0%
through that okay right I'm just tell
you

01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
from because because you said I believe
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
you said that with respect to um adopt
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
that there would be compliance and and
 
01:59:48.189 --> 01:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
that they weren't going to push it's
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
unlikely they'd be pushing out the
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
effective date of the school's policy
 
01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.480 --> 02:00:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
years

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.239 --> 02:00:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.159 --> 02:00:12.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
first does that mean that the policy has
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
to Beed by the first day of school I
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how it could be that's only
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
four weeks correct so my point is my
 
02:00:22.199 --> 02:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
four weeks correct so my point is my
question

02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that's how we always interpret so
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
if it says the actual take
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
effect that means that's when the policy
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
should be in place that's how you're
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
interpreting that because the Act is the
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
act is is the asking you to develop a
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
policy the ACT is telling you to develop
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
a policy it doesn't tell you when you
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
place School Association we've always
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted the bill says eff days after
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
pass and then requ policy within that
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
bill you've always intered that have to
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
push outc
 
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
ready to go well if that's the if that's
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
the common practice and a common
 
02:01:28.109 --> 02:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
understanding then then all we have to
 
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
do is decide when we want this to be
 
02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
implemented because then we'll make that
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
the effective date that the actual take
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
effect 90 days after passage 60 days
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
after passage or a date certain I ask
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
another question so I mean is it
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think that in September of
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
2025 that this would be ready to go okay
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
so it's sign
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
law by Easter
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay January
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
one January
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
one well let me ask you this I don't
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
here's part of where I'm lost on this is
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
I personally think it should be the week
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
before Labor Day right because that's
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
when most I know it's soon but I'm just
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
saying it's no secret that this is out
 
02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
there the governor has been saying this
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
for the past several weeks that doesn't
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
mean anybody's been doing anything about
 
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
it right but it just sounds so reactive
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why it wouldn't be on
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
the school board's radar or why we
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't start working on policies
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
now I know you need the exact wording
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
but you're gonna they're gonna have some
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
idea between once it goes through the
 
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:36.629 align:start position:0%
idea between once it goes through the
Senate

02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
no uh so if if this bill were signed
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
into law in April you mean you have
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
other policies you could not have you
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
think it's unrealistic to have schools
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
adopting and it's unrealistic for them
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
to to develop and adopt a a what could
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
be very well a model at at the very
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
least model School Board Association
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
policy to implement September
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
1st let's just say by May 1 pushing it
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
somewh out but not that out yeah you
 
02:03:08.189 --> 02:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
could definitely have mod policy out by
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
the end of that over
 
02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.069 align:start position:0%
the end of that over
summer

02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay it is you start of
 
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
I think it'll be I think it'll be not
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
that it will be easy but it'll be easier
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
then I I personally though I would say I
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
like that September 1st is clean I would
 
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
back into it so that it's the actual
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
first day of
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
school you know well what's wrong with
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
sept well wait a minute not all schools
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
date for the effectiven of the policy
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
or we can't say no later then that
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's too squishy I would say by August
 
02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
25th that that's can we can you know we
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
got to get August 25th I think so I
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I'd like to say are you okay
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
with August
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
25th do you because you're going to have
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
a model policy before then and they're
 
02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to be able to work on it and they
 
02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.350 align:start position:0%
going to be able to work on it and they
can

02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
is that is that a Monday what are we
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
talking about Monday you're saying that
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
you don't think any schools will start
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
before then so you're capturing all the
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
schools August 25th if you have August
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
25th are you are we capturing all the
 
02:05:06.549 --> 02:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
schools if it's August 25th we don't
 
02:05:06.559 --> 02:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
schools if it's August 25th we don't
know

02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.669 --> 02:05:14.679 align:start position:0%
that are we gonna worry about
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
one we do September one if we do
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
September one just August 25th it's a
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
strange date it's a strange it is a
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
strange date
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
September one if you take September one
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
start August 28th
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
they impl it on
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
August yeah okay I mean it's not like
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
you know they can they can get away with
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
it for six days and then all of a sudden
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
on the first all the cell phones are
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
away that's not going to
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
happen that's the fear right that
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be no policy for six days and
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there'll be a
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
policy okay so where do I unless you
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
want to say at the beginning of the
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
school year but there is no such date
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
date all right so we would need that
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
with respect to the effective dates in
 
02:05:58.159 --> 02:05:59.069 align:start position:0%
with respect to the effective dates in
both

02:05:59.069 --> 02:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
bills the dates shall be we should we
 
02:06:04.549 --> 02:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
recommend that the effective dates with
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
respect to both bills be September 1
 
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
respect to both bills be September 1
2025

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes okay so all that I've done is I have
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
have taken line 13 see how it says three
 
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
I put effective date and I put this act
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
shall take effect September 1st
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
2025 right okay so I'm going to make a
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
motion to that effect do have a is there
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
a second do it have to say after passage
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
does it have to say did you add that I I
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
just it doesn't need to the ex here
 
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.830 align:start position:0%
just it doesn't need to the ex here
September

02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
September
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
one forget it that is there a second
 
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
second call the role please um
 
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hall yes representative
 
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
litfield is yes representative Terry yes
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so here we we did not take
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
out the appropriation or make any
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations with respect to the
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation in 781 all right so we're
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think we send both bills over and the
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
full committee can decide whether it
 
02:07:17.549 --> 02:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
wants to include any money or not I I
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know and that's I think a with what
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
we've done here I think it's marvelous
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
but for us to sit here and make our
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation about whether it should
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
be money isn't going to amount to a hill
 
02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
of beans because once it gets over there
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get everybody's opinion
 
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether that should be and nobody
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
here is going to carry the weight with
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
respect to that I mean I don't have that
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
influence so that being the case um I I
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we have a motion to
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh recommend that uh HP 781 FN be
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
retained because it has to be acted upon
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
by Wednesday
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay even though I disagree even though
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
I don't support it I will make a
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation no you make the
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation I don't make the
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation to is there a second I'll
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
second it okay call the rooll please
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative Hall yes representative
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
litfield and representative Terry
 
02:08:12.669 --> 02:08:12.679 align:start position:0%
yes so in effect now we're sending over
 
02:08:17.709 --> 02:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
two identical bills except for the fact
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
except that we are saying that we have
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
no recommendation about the one but we
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
say that we recommend that the other be
 
02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:29.079 align:start position:0%
retained so by not saying anything about
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that does not have an early
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
date then this gives the committee chair
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
the latitude to
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
schedule uh further consideration of
 
02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.390 align:start position:0%
schedule uh further consideration of
both

02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
bills later on in the months of March
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
April whatever I I have the sense that
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be sat on it's
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to act on this soon can I
 
02:08:52.549 --> 02:08:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually take my vote back back on that
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
on the retained I mean I think there
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any money on this at this
