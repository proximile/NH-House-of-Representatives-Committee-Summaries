sessions i want to get a sense of the
committee

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%

the month of june there are three
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
mondays in the month of june
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
available to us to potentially
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%

june 14th and june 21st
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
and of course there's also june 28th but
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
after we've completed our business so
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
day to be doing to schedule anything but
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do is get a sense for
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
how the rest of the folks feel
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
about scheduling work sessions on
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
on the 7th 14th or 21st does
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
ideas representative flat mr chairman
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
you may go ahead with any of those dates
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
but if it's on june 7th i'll be in
 
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.430 align:start position:0%
but if it's on june 7th i'll be in
florida

00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
florida
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that uh
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
and shall not be joining representative
thomas

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
so you're gone the 21st you're going the
 
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
so you're gone the 21st you're going the
seventh

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
seventh
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any uh reaction to the
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i i'd like to see us begin
 
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i i'd like to see us begin
work

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can i think we haven't do
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
do you have a number there uh
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is the number of retained
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
bills that we
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
have currently in hand i do the number
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
is 14 and i believe either seven or
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
eight of them
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh i'm gonna defer to your wisdom as
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh being a first year
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
legislator it's they all the dates sound
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
good and even though i may be out of
 
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
good and even though i may be out of
town

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
i certainly feel comfortable with the
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
zoom platform if that's not uh
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to continue to join that
 
00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to continue to join that
way

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes we will continue to have meetings
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
we've been conducting them all year long
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
so-called hybrid meetings where um
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
some of us are in person and some of us
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
are online so
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
we will continue that that practice
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
the other reaction to the idea of
 
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.949 align:start position:0%
the other reaction to the idea of
potentially

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
having work sessions on retained bills
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
on either the 7th the 14th or the 21st
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
or possibly
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i've got a sense of the
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee that we could
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably proceed with that activity so
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh i'll get back to you as soon as i
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
have scheduling information and we'll
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
schedule some
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
work sessions on retain bills so we can
 
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
work sessions on retain bills so we can
get

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
some of that work done before fall i
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
will point out
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
that the clerk has informed us that
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
vote on these retained bills until next
 
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.509 align:start position:0%
vote on these retained bills until next
fall

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
so the work sessions that we do conduct
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
will just be simply that work sessions
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
decide if we want to go forward with a
 
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
decide if we want to go forward with a
bill

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
if we do does it mean amendments
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
we'll make arrangements to get those
 
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.150 align:start position:0%
we'll make arrangements to get those
amendments

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
crafted by ols and then
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
come fall we'll have one or more exec
 
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.269 align:start position:0%
come fall we'll have one or more exec
sessions

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%

another thing that i should point out to
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%

it did contain one section

that senator bradley was hopeful would
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%

an amendment to senate bill 78 that adds
 
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.389 align:start position:0%

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%

can

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
successfully uh be retained and then we
 
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
successfully uh be retained and then we
will

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with it later
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that'll mean we have
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
15 retained bills instead of 14 but

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%

h is there any discussion representative
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
mcgee yes thank you mr chairman
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um i was reviewing this last evening and
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
i noted that we had
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
when we had discussed the amendment that
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
was going to be put into ols we said
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that parts 2
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
and 3 were not going to be edited and
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
in section 2 specifically some of the
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
language changes here
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
are problematic and so i just wanted to
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
bring it to your attention that we had
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
not discussed this
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh as a committee or in public hearings
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
none of these changes were agreed to
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
um so they kind of come out of nowhere
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the exec session which is
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunate i think um so i
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
we had discussed uh the changes that
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
would happen in parts one
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
and four uh and the removal of section
 
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
and four uh and the removal of section
five

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
but um but especially the language
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
in section two that removes the
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
well-established language
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
of an avoidance of unjust and
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable cost shifting which is
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
um well-known nomenclature in the public
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
utilities commission for them having to
 
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.149 align:start position:0%
utilities commission for them having to
vet

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
vet
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that no undue cost shifting
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
will occur
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
to this very specific and black and
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
white language which
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
um is not well understood and
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
seems kind of arbitrary it just i don't
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
understand where it came from
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
but i know that in our committee we did
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
not discuss it
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted to bring that to
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
your attention because
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
we had an agreement of what the
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
amendment would include and my
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've just printed an additional
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that doesn't include that
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
language i believe that
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative oxenous put in because um
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know it it's upsetting to see that
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
this is not what we all discussed and
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh i'll respond to you
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee by saying that
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
as i explained in the email that i sent
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
to everyone excuse me could you just
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
get closer to the microphone speak a
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
as i pointed out in the email that i
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
sent out on friday afternoon
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
after considerable discussion with
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
members of the republican caucus both on
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
and in the larger caucus
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
there was some uh concern about the
 
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.230 align:start position:0%
there was some uh concern about the
language

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
that was added to house bill 315
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 109 and
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
the caucus felt that some further
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
the caucus felt that some further
language

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
clarifying our position on cost shifting
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
would be warranted and so that's why we
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
added this
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh language to section two as you point
 
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.669 align:start position:0%
uh language to section two as you point
out

00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
it is black and white language
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
whereas the language that was struck out
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
an avoidance of unjust and unreasonable
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
cost shifting
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to mean that there
 
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to mean that there
is

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable cost shifting
 
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable cost shifting
whereas

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the republican caucus
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh does not share that opinion so
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
this language is the statute of the
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission you're not
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay so this clarifies for the public
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
utilities commission just exactly
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
what kinds of cost shifting
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
the republican caucus thinks is prudent
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why this was added to the
 
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why this was added to the
amendment

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
you're on mute thank you very much
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
um the problem here is that by taking
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
away the well-established standard of
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable or
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
unjust and unreasonable you
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
this language creates a completely new
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
standard that has no place
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
has never appeared before in any of our
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory law
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a standard that literally
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
cannot be implemented
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
by the puc insurer means either
 
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:44.950 align:start position:0%
by the puc insurer means either
guarantee

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
or make certain cost shifting happens
 
00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
or make certain cost shifting happens
all

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
the time if i go away for a week and my
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
neighbor is paying
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
his rates and i'm paying my rates i've
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
had his electricity as its cost shifted
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
if people put in energy efficiency
 
00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:03.110 align:start position:0%
if people put in energy efficiency
measures

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
and they reduce their load there's a car
 
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.230 align:start position:0%
and they reduce their load there's a car
shifting

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's pervasive what what i think
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here is that you
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
minimize unnecessary or
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
burdensome uh cost shifting
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know we we often talk about rough
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
justice um
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of rate setting it can't be
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.269 align:start position:0%
in terms of rate setting it can't be
perfect

00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
and with this language if something is
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
one tenth of a percent of a kilowatt
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
hour off
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a violation you know the puc stands
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
would be tied
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
so um i think that if you would if you
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
need to clarify your position which i
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
think is well established
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
but if you feel the need to have that in
 
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
but if you feel the need to have that in
statute

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
you could use language about minimizing
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh minimizing to the extent practicable
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
um there there is language that could be
 
00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
um there there is language that could be
used

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
but uh the term ensure
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
is a is a real red flag here and
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
particularly as
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has said to to try
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
to create a whole new standard in law
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
that didn't come from the senate it
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't in their version wasn't had
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh didn't have a public hearing wasn't
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
discussed in our work session
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
i'm i i think this would really be an
 
00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:22.549 align:start position:0%
i'm i i think this would really be an
extraordinarily

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily
 
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh bad step um
 
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh bad step um
[Music]

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and i think at least at this point
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's enough to i
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
i do have an amendment uh which
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully will reach us from ols
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
which is to just return to the original
 
00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:37.990 align:start position:0%
which is to just return to the original
language

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh just and reasonable really will carry
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
but if if you feel a need to clarify
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
that it has arrived is that what you're
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
telling me
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
oh great thank you um and there is a
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
one very very small change about the
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
number of members
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's the only other change in that
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative harrington
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
is recognized thank you mr chairman i
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
probably should have caught this earlier
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
so i'll apologize in advance
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
if you look on page four of the amended
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill on line
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh 19 through 21
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
cards primary energy an energy form
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
found in nature that has not been
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
subject to any human engineered
 
00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.509 align:start position:0%
subject to any human engineered
conversion

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
it goes on to list various ones
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
including nuclear
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
that sentence makes no sense because
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
any nuclear power plant every nuclear
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
power plant in the united states
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
is been subject to uh engineering
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
conversion because it uses enriched
 
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.549 align:start position:0%
conversion because it uses enriched
uranium

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
uranium
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to go to canada it might
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
work with a
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
they don't enrich the uranium but it's
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
still kind of hard to say it's not
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
processed so
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure what that statement's
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
getting us but
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh it just it doesn't make sense
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not simply not accurate you
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a human engineered conversion in
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
order to produce nuclear power
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's no full nuclear power that you
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
just dig it up out of the ground and
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
throw it in the bucket and
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
watch it go so it doesn't really make
 
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
watch it go so it doesn't really make
sense

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we could just delete
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
nuclear or
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm trying to still trying to
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
figure out the intent of that but that
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
gets that whole statement that it's not
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
i mean even
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at oil or natural gas i mean
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
taken out it's been refined it's been
 
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
taken out it's been refined it's been
processed

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
processed
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
so this whole idea of human engineered
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
conversion process
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what it means is what it
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
gets us
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
that representative fled is recognized i
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think the tail end
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
of what representative harrington said
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh puts it in context uh because
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
oil has been at least filtered and maybe
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
had additives
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh uh coal has been washed uh
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
and and maybe been de-sulfurized to a
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
certain extent
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
um and uh so so i mean they're all
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
subject to some human engineering i i i
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
think it's it's uh
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
the intent was uh for for energy
 
00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
the intent was uh for for energy
conversion

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
so none of them have done any any uh
 
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:08.550 align:start position:0%
so none of them have done any any uh
human

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
human
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
engineering for energy conversion it's a
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.829 align:start position:0%
engineering for energy conversion it's a
pre-process

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
pre-process
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
of what i'm saying it just doesn't make
 
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
of what i'm saying it just doesn't make
sense

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe well i agree with you that that
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i didn't catch this either the the
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
phrase human engineered conversion
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
process probably isn't necessary
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
obviously the intent of this paragraph
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
is to define primary energy
 
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.349 align:start position:0%
is to define primary energy
sources

00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
although it doesn't actually say primary
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
energy sources but
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
that would seem to be the intent i think
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
given the late
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
hour that that's not something we can
 
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
hour that that's not something we can
fix

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something that one of you
 
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.589 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something that one of you
could

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
think about fixing with new legislation
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
next fall
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring into the
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
calling in from mars okay
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh sorry about that um uh
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to uh uh underscore uh what
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh senator harrington uh represented
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
harrington just said
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh i totally agree with him that at this
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
point that
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
really doesn't belong there um i i
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
i think most people think of primary
 
00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.109 align:start position:0%
i think most people think of primary
energy

00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
and secondary energy in the terms of
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
how much energy do you lose when you go
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
from primary to secondary
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
but it is true that nuclear energy is
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
not considered a primary energy source
 
00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
not considered a primary energy source
as

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the ground like oil does
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
maybe or coal
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
but anyway i want to also
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
remind people i think it was
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative harrington who pointed
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:14.470 align:start position:0%
representative harrington who pointed
out

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
about the issue of uh the cost shifting
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
involved here in the
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph we're talking about i believe
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
that he
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that he doesn't think that
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's practical to be able to
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
do that to guarantee that there is no
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
shifting going on
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
because like like was mentioned before
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's always shifting going on
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
and so it seems to me it makes a lot of
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
sense just to keep it at something
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's a standardized
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh version of what the puc has been
 
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:45.670 align:start position:0%
uh version of what the puc has been
using

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is unjust and unreasonable cost
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
shifting or maybe to include
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
what was suggested minimizing cost
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
shifting but
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's uh and maybe
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative harrington can correct me
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
i believe he was the one who mentioned
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
that before thank you
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i would point
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
out that this language
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
instructs the commission when it
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
develops alternative tariffs
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
to allow for minimal
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
caution such as allowances for metering
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
and building
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
so the language isn't
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
totally black and white there is some
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility there and i think that would
 
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.630 align:start position:0%
flexibility there and i think that would
cover

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
the issues that representative
 
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
the issues that representative
harrington

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier am i correct about
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you okay thank you
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you representative samson
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you have another
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
comment i do thank you it's along those
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
same lines um
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking you mentioned that
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the gop
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
caucus had input to the bill and wanted
 
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.829 align:start position:0%
caucus had input to the bill and wanted
this

00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
approach you know in this bill and
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that there are certainly you
 
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.109 align:start position:0%
i i think that there are certainly you
know

00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
philosophies that different people hold
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they think
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be placed in statute but
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
i feel like our committee has a
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that the
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
statutes are consistent with themselves
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that we're
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that have the knowledge
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
of how the system
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
operates or most of us you know are
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
how the public utilities commission
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
operates and
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
they already have the charge in their
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
mission the way they
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
operate is to make sure that that that
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
cost shifting doesn't happen that's
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
but they're given the latitude in the
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
statute because
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
they're an agency that we have given
 
00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:44.870 align:start position:0%
they're an agency that we have given
that

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
authority to and so this is a hand tying
 
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
authority to and so this is a hand tying
thing

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
which i feel is really inappropriate and
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be imposed from an
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
ideological position then it's just bad
 
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.069 align:start position:0%
ideological position then it's just bad
policy

00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
because and i think that we as the
 
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
because and i think that we as the
gatekeepers

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
gatekeepers
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
on our committee should be the ones that
 
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
on our committee should be the ones that
stop

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
that type of bad policy from going into
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
place because it's
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
almost being put in there as though
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
the puc needs to be policed which they
 
00:39:17.839 --> 00:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
the puc needs to be policed which they
don't

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that they do so i
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's my position is
 
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.870 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's my position is
that

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that the public
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
utilities commission as an
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
agency is doing any of these things
 
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.230 align:start position:0%
agency is doing any of these things
incorrectly

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
and so this seems to be a solution
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
without a problem
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i would i would really ask my
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
republican colleagues to
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh allowing that language to
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
remain because
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to help any of the
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of policies that we have
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and it and again it assumes a wrong
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee i'd
 
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee i'd
remind

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
remind
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
you representative mcgee and other
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
members of your caucus that
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
i've heard all of you state in
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings before this committee on
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
many occasions
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
that there is no cost shifting in net
 
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.790 align:start position:0%
that there is no cost shifting in net
metering

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
and if you are correct about that then
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
this language will have no
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
significant effect therefore uh
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
if the republican caucus feels that it's
 
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:30.790 align:start position:0%
if the republican caucus feels that it's
prudent

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
public policy which is the message
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
that i get from my colleagues in the
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
republican practice
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
then we probably have a minor
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
disagreement about
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
that issue mr chair follow-up
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up because you're you're you're
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
missing as soon as i finish my comment
 
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:50.950 align:start position:0%
missing as soon as i finish my comment
sure

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure so as i was saying
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
the republican caucus feels this is
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
prudent public policy
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
now you may disagree with that but which
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
is you're right
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
but that is the public policy direction
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we are going to take in this
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
particular instance
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative mcgee you're right
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your indulgence dilliance
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
what i would say is that the um evidence
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
that has been provided
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
has concluded that there is no
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
discernible cost shifting and that's
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
so that's an evidence-based decision
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's not our opinion
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
putting in language that now there is no
 
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
putting in language that now there is no
latitude

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
does something different because as rep
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine was saying cost
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
shifting in terms of absolutes
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
like the fact that somebody's using
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's not where it's going to
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
who's paying what that is an impossible
 
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.270 align:start position:0%
who's paying what that is an impossible
task

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
task
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is we're setting
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
forth in statute
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
language that is unattainable right it's
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
not stopping
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
cost shifting from happening it's
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
stopping the public utilities commission
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
from being able to do
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
anything because anything will
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
involve costs moving around
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have to have someone do an assessment
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
to bring information to us
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
if adding distributed energy resources
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
to the system
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
is ever starting to shift in terms of
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
people who are non
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
you know who are rate payers but are not
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
participating in that market are then
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
getting some of those costs we have no
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
evidence that that has happened to this
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
point because we have very little
 
00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:37.030 align:start position:0%
point because we have very little
penetration

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
penetration
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
but we also have requested of the public
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
that they provide evidence to us on an
 
00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
that they provide evidence to us on an
ongoing

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
basis right they're supposed to report
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
to us annually
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
so we have a way to address it if there
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
is an
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
issue but what this does is it creates
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
an issue for the public utilities
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
commission which is why i would again
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
protest that this is not a good policy
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just might note
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
here that we're dealing with a very
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
small population this is not the
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
customer base as a whole
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about customer
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
generators which there are going to be
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
very very few
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not like everybody that's an
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
electric meter is covered by this it's
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
very specific to them
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
and it tells the puc how to do it and i
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
see no problem with the language
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxendine is
 
00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxendine is
recognized

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i must say i
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
am rather flummoxed that as a former puc
 
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.950 align:start position:0%
am rather flummoxed that as a former puc
commissioner

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative harrington does not
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
perceive a difficulty with this
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
impossible standard being put into law
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
um moving right along uh however from
 
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.150 align:start position:0%
um moving right along uh however from
that

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
the puc has an ongoing
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
docket in in it which has to do
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the value of this kind of
 
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.150 align:start position:0%
with the value of this kind of
generation

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we are waiting for the outcome of
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
that pending that the puc
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
has stated that there is no significant
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
cost shifting attached to this and and
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
and this is where discernible
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
significant significance is the word
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
codified because as as we said
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
costs move around and and no two
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
customers are ever
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
exactly the same what what this is doing
 
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:32.630 align:start position:0%
exactly the same what what this is doing
is

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
making it impossible for there to be a
 
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.670 align:start position:0%
making it impossible for there to be a
successful

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
net metering rate making case in the
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
future because the puc's hands will be
 
00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:40.950 align:start position:0%
future because the puc's hands will be
tied

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
tied
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
this this is an attempt to slip in a
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
whole new standard into law and a
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
workable standard
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
one that is impossible to achieve
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
um you may say it's very few uh
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
at the moment but we're not making
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
law here just for the moment we're
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is becoming part of the
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
rsas this
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
this will will continue to fester it
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
will continue to stand
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
as an impediment because those agency
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
personnel who are trying to do what the
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislature is directing them
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
will go to this and say it looks like
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
they you know they had a discussion they
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
knew it was an impossible standard and
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
they voted for it anyway
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you they don't want
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative oxendine
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington did you
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to respond to uh representative
 
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
want to respond to uh representative
oxendine

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
oxendine
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
not worth it okay thank you uh
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
representative samson
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
is recognized i object yes thank you mr
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
to your comment that we democrats have
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
been saying
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
that there's no cost shifting going on i
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
just amplify what has been just said
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
that finding was a puc finding from
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
2017 order number two six
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
cola uh cohen's or come out zero two
 
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
cola uh cohen's or come out zero two
nine

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
in that puc finding they were the ones
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
who said that there was
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
quote little to no evidence of any
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
significant cost shifting
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
due to net metering so it's not just us
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
who are just coming out of the blue with
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
with this kind of statement the puc said
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
this that's why we are
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
quoting it now if the puc says something
 
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.950 align:start position:0%
quoting it now if the puc says something
different

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
we would probably decide to quote that
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
but right now that is the last quote we
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
heard on this thank you
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsung i would
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
point out that that very same
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
order that you're reading from also
 
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:47.990 align:start position:0%
order that you're reading from also
contains

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
contains
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
text from the consumer advocate that
 
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.349 align:start position:0%
text from the consumer advocate that
says

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
that net readering does ship costs and
 
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
that net readering does ship costs and
that

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
the commission investigated
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
investigation of alternative net
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
metering tariffs
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
should account for that
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
and ameliorate it where possible
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
i've read that order numerous times
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
and that one quote that you cherry
 
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
and that one quote that you cherry
picked

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
picked
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
does not take a full picture
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
of what the commission order said
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
on that proceeding all right are there
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
further representative flett is
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
recognized i would just say that that
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
as you say cherry pick quote i've heard
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
from the democrats and if that's true
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
this has no
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative bernardi is recognized
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
for a comment
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes i i would just like to point out
 
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
yes i i would just like to point out
that

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
up to this point uh net beatering is
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the one megawatt and below but we
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
have been considering multiple pieces of
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that would expand net
 
00:47:58.319 --> 00:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
legislation that would expand net
metering

00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
to a much higher rate and therefore
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
we believe it's very important that the
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue of cost shifting
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
be part of the equation that the puc
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
looks at
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
and ensures that there is no
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
cost shifting particularly when we go to
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
these higher
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi does
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion here
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative berezin thank you i'll
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
just add that
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
this does say except for minimal
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
allowances for international buildings
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
so this is not an absolute no costume it
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
does allow you for pointing that out
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxendine you still
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
have your hand up
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
please you've already been recognized
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
twice to speak
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
no speeches are allowed if you have a
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
valid point to make that would be
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
acceptable but please don't
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
go into a long speech
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
and you're on you as well
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes uh the point
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
was just made that
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
this um has a latitude the latitude is
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
very specific and very limited and does
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
not cover
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
this new broad-based standard
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
of ensuring which means to guarantee or
 
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.630 align:start position:0%
of ensuring which means to guarantee or
make

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
certain words such as ameliorate
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
words such as maximize something to the
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
extent practicable
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
any of those could could meet the
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've raised here but
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
honestly i i think the best thing for us
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
is to leave the language as it is and as
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
you have suggested in
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
other portions of this bill let someone
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
bring forward legislation in the fall
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
good suggestion thank you
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
representatives uh representative kelly
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
pets is recognized
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm looking at the amendment i'm
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
when the puc goes through its procedure
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
to enact this amendment
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
and to make this is going to be a couple
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
of years i'm
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing and that
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
to ensure all that these the data is
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
correct and again
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
ensure so
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
my question to the chair would be should
 
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.829 align:start position:0%
my question to the chair would be should
we

00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
sacrifice the good for the perfect i
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
believe that in
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
the when the puc goes through this they
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
will not be able to
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
costs are not shifted in some way
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
any a big way or a small way i don't
 
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.829 align:start position:0%
any a big way or a small way i don't
know

00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
and it will take them at least a couple
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
of years to do that would
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that a fair estimate on my part
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's fair the alternative net
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
metering tariff uh docket is still open
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
at the puc it's been open for
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
three years now maybe yeah
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh and there are a couple of studies
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
that were commissioned as part of that
 
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
that were commissioned as part of that
docket

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
docket
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
that have yet to be completed and once
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
those studies are completed
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
then they can move forward with
 
00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
then they can move forward with
potential

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
the development of potential new tariffs
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it could be some time you're right
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
before they have to deal with this
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
language nevertheless
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is important to the republican caucus
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
this language be there so that when they
 
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:48.549 align:start position:0%
this language be there so that when they
do

00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
start deliberating on future alternative
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
net tutoring tariffs
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
that they understand that this is an
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
important principle
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
under which they should conduct
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay i think we've had adequate uh
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
comment on this uh amendment so i would
 
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.190 align:start position:0%
comment on this uh amendment so i would
like

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh to now ask the clerk to call the role
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
on the adoption of amendment 2021-1619-h
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%

house

02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
that very purpose when your kids move
 
02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
out you convert
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
hi matt nice to see you
 
02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:42.560 align:start position:0%

see you as well
 
02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
these two gentlemen uh chris elms and
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
matt maywe
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
have graciously agreed to do a
 
02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
presentation and i know they're both
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
busy men so i don't want to
 
02:56:56.550 --> 02:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
keep them any longer that is absolutely
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
necessary so let's get this
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
meeting underway i know there are still
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
a few folks who are with us this morning
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are not online
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that means they won't be
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
here or
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
if they're just tardy getting back from
 
02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:12.550 align:start position:0%
if they're just tardy getting back from
lunch

02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
but in any case let's start this
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
presentation i will turn the floor
 
02:57:20.550 --> 02:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
over to chris elms and matt mayu from
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's office gentlemen
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
take it right away thank you mr chairman
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the invite to appear
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
before science technology
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
and energy the presentation i have for
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
you today is the same presentation i
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
offered to the senate finance committee
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
last week at this time and we apologize
 
02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:40.389 align:start position:0%
last week at this time and we apologize
for

02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
needing to reschedule from last week but
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
we were very excited to see a bipartisan
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
six to one vote out of the senate
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
for the department of energy proposal
 
02:57:54.070 --> 02:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
with the accompanying amendments and i'm
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
happy to review the amendment as well
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
um but i think this will be a good
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
conversation today happy to take
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions as we go along
 
02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
i know there's been plenty of
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
conversations about the department what
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
some of its goals are
 
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
and happy just provide the committee an
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
overview happy to get deep into the
 
02:58:12.399 --> 02:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
overview happy to get deep into the
weeds

02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
on energy policy it's great to see a lot
 
02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:16.550 align:start position:0%
on energy policy it's great to see a lot
of

02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
the familiar faces and for the reps on
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
ft e that i haven't met before
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
i used to be the governor's energy
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
advisor prior to stepping into this role
 
02:58:27.190 --> 02:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
as budget director
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
so i am again more than happy to have a
 
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
deep policy conversation
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
on any of these topics as well but with
 
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
that why don't we jump in
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and give you a brief 40 000 foot
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
overview what the proposal is
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
would be to combine the energy functions
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the office of strategic initiatives
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
with portions of the public utilities
 
02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:52.469 align:start position:0%
with portions of the public utilities
commission

02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
and ultimately we see this as an
 
02:58:54.319 --> 02:58:55.830 align:start position:0%
and ultimately we see this as an
opportunity

02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:58:57.910 --> 02:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
to reach better outcomes whether it be
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
for ratepayers
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
or even just to give energy policy a
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
singular home here in the state of new
 
02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:05.269 align:start position:0%
singular home here in the state of new
hampshire

02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
so the new department of energy
 
02:59:08.710 --> 02:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
structure would be
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
that single entity if you will for
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
energy policy decision making here in
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we're able to leverage some of those
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-regulatory functions
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
of what the current public utilities
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
commission does
 
02:59:26.230 --> 02:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
unify those with the energy components
 
02:59:26.240 --> 02:59:26.630 align:start position:0%
unify those with the energy components
of

02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives and
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
form this new department out of
 
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
existing pieces within state government
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
from there we would separate the
 
02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
non-energy functions that currently
 
02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
exist at osi
 
02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the department of business and
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
with one small program the conservation
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
land stewardship program
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to the department of
 
02:59:51.510 --> 02:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
as for the puc which again is the
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
existing regulatory body
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is entirely reorganized within the
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll also note that this proposal
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
does not make any changes to the office
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the consumer advocate
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
or the site evaluation committee beyond
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
just changing
 
03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
their administrative attachments where
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
they get their administrative back
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
office support
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
would change from the puc to the
 
03:00:21.349 --> 03:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
for those and i'm sure this committee is
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
a familiar with osi
 
03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
and its various functions but for those
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
that might
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily have the same level of
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
exposure to it
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
osi is part of the governor's office as
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
part of the executive department
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
and functions functions as the
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office for energy policy
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
as well as administering various federal
 
03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:44.790 align:start position:0%
as well as administering various federal
programs

03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:00:47.110 --> 03:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
like the low-income heating assistance
 
03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:48.389 align:start position:0%
like the low-income heating assistance
program

03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
the weatherization program the state
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
energy program
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
and really serves as a pass through for
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars that come into the
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
state and then are disbursed out into
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
the community
 
03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
to assist some of those critical income
 
03:01:04.389 --> 03:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
qualified programs
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
but it's also important to note that osi
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
as currently constructed
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
constructed uh does a variety of other
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
things as well
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
everything from the u.s census to
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring state
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
land easements the national flood
 
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
insurance program
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
offering assistance to municipal
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
planning agencies or planning boards
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
and really has become a catch-all if you
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
will at one point osi administered
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program and
 
03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
needless to say is not the entity that
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
is able to focus a hundred percent of
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
its time
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
on energy policy and that's one of the
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
things that we hope to
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
rectify through this new organization of
 
03:01:43.590 --> 03:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
state government
 
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
really keep some of these different
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
policy areas uh better aligned as
 
03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:48.070 align:start position:0%
policy areas uh better aligned as
opposed

03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
to having this um an alphabet soup if
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
you will
 
03:01:56.469 --> 03:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
the way osi currently is structured
 
03:01:58.870 --> 03:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
some of the overall policy goals like i
 
03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:00.389 align:start position:0%
some of the overall policy goals like i
said

03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:02:02.230 --> 03:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
we see this as a great way to unify
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
energy efforts in the state
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
but the other two areas i really want to
 
03:02:07.190 --> 03:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
are how the commission the puc currently
 
03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:11.429 align:start position:0%
are how the commission the puc currently
operates

03:02:11.429 --> 03:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
operates
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
um allows for at the very least a
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
perceived conflict of interest
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
in the dual role that staff occupies
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
so commissioned staff presently are able
 
03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:23.670 align:start position:0%
so commissioned staff presently are able
to

03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
be a party to the docket help build
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the evidentiary record present
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
evidence before the commission but then
 
03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:33.590 align:start position:0%
evidence before the commission but then
also

03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:02:36.389 --> 03:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
advise the commission outside the
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
hearing room on
 
03:02:40.630 --> 03:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
how they should rule on any given docket
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
imagine if the prosecutor also sat
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the jury a similar similar type of a
 
03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:48.150 align:start position:0%
on the jury a similar similar type of a
concept

03:02:48.150 --> 03:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
concept
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
um what we're hoping to do by creating
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
this new department of energy
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
is establish a bright red line
 
03:02:56.870 --> 03:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
essentially you either
 
03:02:59.670 --> 03:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
work as an advisor to the commissioners
 
03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
and help them
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
rule on a given docket issue their order
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
think of it similar to a clerk or a
 
03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
think of it similar to a clerk or a
judge

03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
or the other alternative is that you
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
work for the department
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
you represent the interests of the state
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you make your case in the hearing
 
03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:16.469 align:start position:0%
and you make your case in the hearing
room

03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
but never behind closed doors so again
 
03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
that bright red line that
 
03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
degree of separation we think will not
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
only allow the commission to operate
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
better and more effectively
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
but also resolve some again this
 
03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
but also resolve some again this
perception

03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
perception
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
that staff plays in both arenas if you
 
03:03:35.279 --> 03:03:36.469 align:start position:0%
that staff plays in both arenas if you
will

03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
the other critical policy goal from this
 
03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
the other critical policy goal from this
proposal

03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
is adding accountability from governor
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
and council and this is something that
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
every other state agency
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
has this level of accountability the puc
 
03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
as it's currently structured
 
03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
only the commissioners are confirmed by
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
they served six-year terms this proposal
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change that
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
but what it would add is additional
 
03:04:00.399 --> 03:04:01.269 align:start position:0%
but what it would add is additional
accountability

03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the division directors which
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
currently are
 
03:04:07.910 --> 03:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
chosen by the puc but never need to be
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
for a formal confirmation process so in
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
the new department of energy you would
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
have the commissioner
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
the deputy commissioner and the four
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
division directors that we'll touch on
 
03:04:22.150 --> 03:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit later all serve on set
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
four-year terms and again require
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
moving on to some of the financials this
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
proposal does
 
03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
modestly save general funds
 
03:04:39.670 --> 03:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking 250 000
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
a year which out of a 13.5 or 13.6
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollar budget
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
is certainly nothing to write home about
 
03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
but the reason i include this is just to
 
03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
show that we're not expanding government
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're not asking
 
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund to foot a larger bill
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
as part of this proposal
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason we find these
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
efficiencies are really the back office
 
03:05:03.439 --> 03:05:04.309 align:start position:0%
efficiencies are really the back office
components

03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
components
 
03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
unifying the pucs back office without
 
03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
parts of osi
 
03:05:11.830 --> 03:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
and similarly at the department of
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
so again essentially from a general fund
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
perspective it's net negative
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
and that's largely just going from three
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
if you do look in the budget book you
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
will see that there is a
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
total budget increase but what's
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
important to note is
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of that increase was
 
03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
explained by
 
03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
projections that the puc makes on
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
how much auction money the regional
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
reggie those quarterly auctions bring in
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
03:05:49.830 --> 03:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
and as i'm sure this committee is well
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
aware the vast majority of those dollars
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
are rebated back
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
to rate payers both commercial and
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
and that is something that certainly
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
shows up on the budget as a grant
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
that goes out to ratepayers
 
03:06:07.429 --> 03:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
but does you know artificially inflate
 
03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
what what the department's budget would
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
be because of that grant line
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
puc chairwoman diane martin wrote a memo
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
to the house finance committee
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh about three months ago now explaining
 
03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
uh about three months ago now explaining
that

03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
component and how those uh analyses are
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
done and
 
03:06:26.550 --> 03:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately what gets uh pushed back out
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the door
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
but but certainly happy to provide that
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
memo to the committee as well
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
and here you just see the the budget
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
changed by the different sources of
 
03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:40.550 align:start position:0%
changed by the different sources of
funds

03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
you see the the largest increases are
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
in federal funds so again more federal
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
dollars coming into the state
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
whether it be for energy efficiency
 
03:06:51.030 --> 03:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
through the weather
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization program or the low-income
 
03:06:53.920 --> 03:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
weatherization program or the low-income
uh

03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program you'll see the
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
decrease in general funds
 
03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
again modest all things considered
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then that increase in other funds
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
again tied to the reggie auction revenue
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
and there you see the breakdown across
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
as we had promised during the house
 
03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:17.830 align:start position:0%
as we had promised during the house
phase

03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
phase
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
we knew that this was a large proposal
 
03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
we knew that we wanted to make sure that
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
the final product had deep stakeholder
 
03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
the final product had deep stakeholder
input

03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
input
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
so we made some technical amendments on
 
03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
the house side
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
before their april 8 deadline and then
 
03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:34.389 align:start position:0%
before their april 8 deadline and then
brought

03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
brought
 
03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
a second amendment to the senate finance
 
03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
a second amendment to the senate finance
committee

03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
with additional technical corrections we
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
heard from stakeholders regarding
 
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
the organization of certain positions
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
how the i.t costs would be structured
 
03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
what types of physical distancing we
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
would want to see
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the department staff versus the
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
commission staff
 
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
and incorporated all of that different
 
03:07:58.720 --> 03:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
and incorporated all of that different
feedback

03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether it was from clean energy groups
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
or regulated industry
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
or just people that interface with the
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
commission on a regular basis
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that the final
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
product we put forward
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
would resolve those long-standing
 
03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
challenges uh and we're very
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
excited to have had amendment 1520s
 
03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
incorporated into house bill 2
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
and i think it had again a broad
 
03:08:26.469 --> 03:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support which is recognized
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
not only in stakeholder comments
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
but also in the 6-1 vote out of the
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
senate finance committee
 
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we certainly
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
heard during the house phase is
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
how many lawyers the commission would
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
need to have in this new structure
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
and as part of this amendment that we
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward and was voted on last
 
03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:46.150 align:start position:0%
brought forward and was voted on last
week

03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
we've added more lawyers back to the
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission we've
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
brought the clerk's office back over
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
and there was another amendment brought
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
by senator bradley
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
to bring the general counsel position
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
out of the department of energy
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
and put it back at the public utilities
 
03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:02.389 align:start position:0%
and put it back at the public utilities
commission

03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:09:03.990 --> 03:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i will say i really think this
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
process has been very collaborative has
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
been very effective
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think everyone has had a chance to
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
have their voice heard
 
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
and it's been a resounding yes that this
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy proposal
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
is the right path forward for the state
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
two other things that i'll touch on here
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
one of which being the site evaluation
 
03:09:24.399 --> 03:09:25.349 align:start position:0%
one of which being the site evaluation
committee

03:09:25.349 --> 03:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
we know there's been a lot of
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
conversation not only in the legislature
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
but also a governor and council
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't make any policy changes to the
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
sec during the budget
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
but we did charter a study committee to
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
evaluate what necessary changes might
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
be needed that committee would have
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
three members of the house two members
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
and work on a very tight timeline over
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
i believe the final report is due
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
october 1st
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
but wanting to make sure that the
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
overall mission of the sec is being
 
03:09:57.520 --> 03:09:58.229 align:start position:0%
overall mission of the sec is being
achieved

03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
that the financing and funding structure
 
03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
aligns with how other states do similar
 
03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:04.950 align:start position:0%
aligns with how other states do similar
work

03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and rectify some of those ongoing
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring and compliance issues
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
that we know have bubbled up over the
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
past several years
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the current structure so again no
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
hard and fast policy changes but we're
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
very excited for what
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
future legislation that study committee
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
might recommend separately and this is
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
something i should have led with off the
 
03:10:28.479 --> 03:10:29.349 align:start position:0%
something i should have led with off the
top

03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
top
 
03:10:31.110 --> 03:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the genesis of this
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
idea for department of energy
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
the credit really does come back to the
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
through house bill 156 from 2019
 
03:10:43.269 --> 03:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
which was the study commission that
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
really kicked off these conversations in
 
03:10:45.359 --> 03:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
really kicked off these conversations in
earnest

03:10:47.269 --> 03:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
earnest
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
and former chairman bob backus
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative backus from manchester
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
um you know really was the leader of
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
initiative he chaired that study
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
commission and a lot of those
 
03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversations certainly
 
03:11:02.790 --> 03:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
influenced the direction that we headed
 
03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
um and again i think that's just spoken
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the broad bipartisan buy-in
 
03:11:11.990 --> 03:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we've seen for this idea so
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
obviously uh
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank thanks where thanks is due and
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
again this committee certainly
 
03:11:20.150 --> 03:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
had a large role uh prior to the session
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
in shaping what some of those
 
03:11:21.359 --> 03:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
in shaping what some of those
conversations

03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
would look like flipping now just to
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
some of what the actual organization
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
charts would look like at this
 
03:11:28.319 --> 03:11:29.910 align:start position:0%
charts would look like at this
department

03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
dea you see the osi division of planning
 
03:11:35.429 --> 03:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
essentially being picked up and
 
03:11:37.110 --> 03:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
relocated and dropped back down
 
03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
with no real changes you see those
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
positions things that offer municipal
 
03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:43.349 align:start position:0%
positions things that offer municipal
assistance

03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
operate the state data center gis census
 
03:11:47.910 --> 03:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
things of that nature
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
i know commissioner caswell is very
 
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
excited to have these functions
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh be fitted into bea he definitely sees
 
03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:55.429 align:start position:0%
uh be fitted into bea he definitely sees
the

03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
nexus in his department's mission with
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
this component of osi
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
and we're very excited for for this new
 
03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
and we're very excited for for this new
unification

03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
unification
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
at das i mentioned the conservation land
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
stewardship program
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
would become administratively attached
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is a two-person program
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
that monitors state easements whether it
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
be for
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources or fish
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
and game
 
03:12:23.429 --> 03:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
and a function that has been located osi
 
03:12:23.439 --> 03:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
and a function that has been located osi
previously

03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
previously
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
and now would just be administratively
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
attached to administrative services
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
this is a self-funded program based on a
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated account
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
for that ongoing monitoring of these
 
03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:36.950 align:start position:0%
for that ongoing monitoring of these
properties

03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then transitioning here into the
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
what you see here is division level
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown so starting in the top
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
left corner the office of the consumer
 
03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:48.309 align:start position:0%
left corner the office of the consumer
advocate

03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
no changes would be administratively
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
attached to the department
 
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
on the top right you see the site
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee again
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
no changes administratively attached
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative commissioners
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
accounting in 1892
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
second from the left this is where the
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory functions of the puc would be
 
03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
regulatory functions of the puc would be
located

03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
located
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
so you would have the adjudicated
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners the three quasi judicial
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners that oversee dockets
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
with their staff and i'll touch on
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what staff that looks like in a
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
bit later
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then sliding over one to the office
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
would be the new agency head for this
 
03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
would be the new agency head for this
department

03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
very similar to environmental services
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
or any one of those
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
other state agencies that has a single
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
agency head
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
with several division directors below
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
them and there would be four divisions
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
in this proposal
 
03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
administrative support which would be
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
the back office the accounting functions
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
the legal division that would provide
 
03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
the legal division that would provide
support

03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
not only to the department but also the
 
03:13:54.399 --> 03:13:55.269 align:start position:0%
not only to the department but also the
puc

03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
puc
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and the office
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the consumer advocate
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh as a central services model right to
 
03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:02.710 align:start position:0%
uh as a central services model right to
provide

03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
um administrative back-end support to
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
each of those different entities
 
03:14:09.750 --> 03:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then below that you see the other
 
03:14:12.550 --> 03:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
three divisions policy and programs
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and regulatory um and i'll
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
start flipping through these here
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
so you see the commissioner's office the
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the deputy
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then here in policy and programs
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
this is where the
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
energy components of osi would be
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
inserted into so you see things like the
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
weatherization program the fuel
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
03:14:38.229 --> 03:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
as well as some of the more policy
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
driven elements of the current puc
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
things that don't really fit in a
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory entity
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh and those would be things like the
 
03:14:46.950 --> 03:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy division
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
which offers grants and rebates for
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
consumers that install renewable energy
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
things like the offshore wind office
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
which is funded for the first time
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
in this budget proposal the nesco
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
manager which is how the state
 
03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
interacts at a regional and a federal
 
03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:04.630 align:start position:0%
interacts at a regional and a federal
level

03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
on policy beyond our state borders
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and lastly the consumer director so any
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
of those
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
customer service elements that the puc
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
does that don't really fit within a
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory model
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
now here under the department of energy
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
moving over to the division of
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement these would be things like
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the audit division that currently exists
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the puc
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
the safety division uh things
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
like gas pipeline safety those programs
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
which again aren't truly regulatory in
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
nature um would fit here under the
 
03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
nature um would fit here under the
department

03:15:38.950 --> 03:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
and also any of the investigations this
 
03:15:42.309 --> 03:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
could be things
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
um either compliance issues uh or other
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
investigatory elements of what might
 
03:15:50.830 --> 03:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
exist within
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
a department of energy setting
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then finally the regulatory division
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
this is where the puc staff
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
would participate in dockets on behalf
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
of the public interest representing the
 
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
interests of the state
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
would appear before the public utilities
 
03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
would appear before the public utilities
commission

03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
and these are existing divisions at the
 
03:16:14.550 --> 03:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
puc so things like the electric division
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the gas and water division would be
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
located here within the department of
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
energy this division
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
would automatically be a party to any
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
puc proceeding
 
03:16:28.830 --> 03:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
so that they would have the duty and the
 
03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:30.309 align:start position:0%
so that they would have the duty and the
obligation

03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
to appear before the commission to
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
address the state's position and also
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
contribute to filling a complete docket
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
for the commission ultimately to issue
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
an order on
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
but that's the model that we see here
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
this here would be the support division
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
so things like it
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
the business office federal grants
 
03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
the business office federal grants
compliance

03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the legal division you'll notice in
 
03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
the top row the general counsel
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
a senate amendment did move that from
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
this division
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
into the public utilities commission i
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
apologize you didn't update the slide
 
03:17:09.910 --> 03:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
but that would be the one change on this
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
particular slide that you see
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate as i
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are no changes in this
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
budget proposal
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
but this is their current five-person
 
03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:21.910 align:start position:0%
but this is their current five-person
staff

03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
similarly on the site evaluation
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee no changes to personnel
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
but we did include language for that
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
um to look at future changes that might
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
be necessary
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the adjudicative
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
commissioners or this is the the public
 
03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
utilities commission as it would be
 
03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:41.429 align:start position:0%
utilities commission as it would be
reformed

03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
reformed
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
you see the three commissioners that
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
oversee the agency
 
03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
led by the chairman and adding
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
again the clerks filing administrator
 
03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants and an
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
attorney into this
 
03:18:00.309 --> 03:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
new entity or this recreated entity
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they have the direct
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
support that they need
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then the six senior advisor
 
03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
and then the six senior advisor
positions

03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
which would be those staff roles that
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
never would appear before the commission
 
03:18:12.870 --> 03:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
in dockets
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
but would help them issue orders and
 
03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
come to their decision making
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
on the issues that are pending before
 
03:18:21.990 --> 03:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
the commission so that's the role that
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
we've envisioned
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there like i said more than
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
i know that there's a lot to digest here
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
i am happy to share the amendment with
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the committee as well
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
mostly reference changes and just
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
technical cleanup
 
03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
the bulk of what we did again was
 
03:18:51.030 --> 03:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
solicit that stakeholder feedback and
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the right entity
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
had the right powers and the right
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
duties uh to carry out this mission
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
should this stay in the budget and
 
03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
should the budget pass and we're very
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
excited for for these changes to take
 
03:19:04.399 --> 03:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
excited for for these changes to take
effect

03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
effect
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh and look forward to um again better
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes for rate payers and i think it
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
goes without saying that governor sununu
 
03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh has been the fiercest advocate
 
03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
fiercest advocate for residential
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
ratepayers especially
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
throughout his time in office and we see
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
this as part and parcel
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
of that past policy thank you mr
 
03:19:25.279 --> 03:19:27.349 align:start position:0%
of that past policy thank you mr
chairman

03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr melo appreciate you
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
giving us that presentation
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh mr elms is there anything you want to
 
03:19:35.670 --> 03:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
add to uh
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
mr melo's comments no
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think matt summed that up pretty
 
03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
pretty well but uh yeah definitely happy
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative callie pitts is
 
03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute i want to be
 
03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute i want to be
recognized

03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
um why does this particular
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
formation of an agency belong in the
 
03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:04.150 align:start position:0%
formation of an agency belong in the
finance

03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
finance
 
03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee and not in the energy
 
03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:07.269 align:start position:0%
committee and not in the energy
committee

03:20:07.269 --> 03:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
and in the back of the budget it would
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
seem that this is a policy
 
03:20:15.030 --> 03:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
so could you answer that for me sure and
 
03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
i apologize that i didn't dive into this
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh during the presentation but
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to reorganizations of
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
state government
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
whether it was splitting apart dread in
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
2017 or the formation of the department
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
of military affairs
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
and veterans services in 2019
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
whenever you're moving different parts
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
of state government around
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
those have been traditionally done
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
through house bill 1 and house bill 2.
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
so this is certainly keeping with past
 
03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
so this is certainly keeping with past
practice

03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and we do feel confident that what we've
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
put forward because of the work
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the study commission to establish a
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:20:58.389 --> 03:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
because of that work that predated the
 
03:20:58.399 --> 03:20:59.269 align:start position:0%
because of that work that predated the
budget

03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh we certainly feel that this policy
 
03:21:03.030 --> 03:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
has been vetted
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
and again i think the broad bipartisan
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
support for these changes has
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
spoken to the the process that we've
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
can i follow up follow up
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh as far as funding for the puc
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding and it may not
 
03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
be that
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
the majority of the funding comes from
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers so is are the rate payers
 
03:21:28.399 --> 03:21:28.790 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers so is are the rate payers
now

03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to fund the department of energy
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
so the ratepayers would still fund any
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
direct work that's done for regulation
 
03:21:43.190 --> 03:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
so yes some of those utility assessment
 
03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:43.990 align:start position:0%
so yes some of those utility assessment
dollars

03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
would go to the department of energy but
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that there are
 
03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
other funding sources
 
03:21:51.990 --> 03:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
such as reggie such as the renewable
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
energy fund
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
and especially the federal dollars
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
almost all of what's being pulled in
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
from the office of strategic initiatives
 
03:22:03.910 --> 03:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh representative mcgee
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
is recognized
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
melo for taking my question
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
um i had a bunch of questions from the
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
original language which i understand
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
has been modified since it's gotten over
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the senate
 
03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was concerning
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
to me in reading through the original
 
03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
language in hb2
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
around the doe was that there seemed to
 
03:22:29.359 --> 03:22:31.429 align:start position:0%
around the doe was that there seemed to
be

03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
a confluence in the language for
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
investigations and
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
other activities that would be
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
undertaken where
 
03:22:41.830 --> 03:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the doe and the puc were kind of used
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
interchangeably or in the same sentence
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
it would say that it would be both their
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to wage the
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
investigation and i thought that the
 
03:22:49.940 --> 03:22:49.950 align:start position:0%
lack of um
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
lack of um
[Music]

03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:22:53.830 --> 03:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of specificity in terms of
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
where those
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
you called it a red line you know like
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
what the separation was in terms of how
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
it was going to be done
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
i understand that there may be cases
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
where it would be one or the other but i
 
03:23:04.469 --> 03:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
would think in the adjudicative
 
03:23:04.479 --> 03:23:05.670 align:start position:0%
would think in the adjudicative
proceedings

03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
it might not be the right place for the
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
doe to be stepping in so i
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could say how you see
 
03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
that working because
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
um you know i just want to be sure
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
that there's still sufficient
 
03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
independence in the public utility
 
03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
independence in the public utility
commission

03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
to function i understand the stuff you
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
want to clean up but i think that that
 
03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
want to clean up but i think that that
could

03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
introduce a new problem does that make
 
03:23:31.439 --> 03:23:31.910 align:start position:0%
introduce a new problem does that make
sense

03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know and i appreciate the
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say is the vast
 
03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say is the vast
majority

03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
majority
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
of functions are cordoned off to one or
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
the other and i think the sections in
 
03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
the other and i think the sections in
hb2

03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:23:48.070 --> 03:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
where you do see the commission and the
 
03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:49.269 align:start position:0%
where you do see the commission and the
department

03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
are on things that regulated entities
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
have the duty to respond
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
to whichever one is conducting an
 
03:23:56.960 --> 03:23:57.750 align:start position:0%
to whichever one is conducting an
investigation

03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
or that both entities would have access
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
to confidential information regarding a
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding right that
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's certainly confidential
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
information that the
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
department staff would need to work
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
through a docket
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
and then similarly but separately that
 
03:24:16.950 --> 03:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
the commission would need
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
that confidential information to weigh
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
in and decide
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
but i do think the duties are clear
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
outside of those
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
few circumstances where there really
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
does need to be accountability to both
 
03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
the department and the commission
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
that if it is a a rate proceeding
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
a rate case that certainly is something
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is decided by the commission
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
if it's something regarding policy like
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy rebates
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
or offshore winds that's certainly
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
something that's done by the department
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
so i will admit there are a few rare
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
instances where it is a shared duty but
 
03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
we feel that those are purposeful
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
and uh intentionally done for the
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
specific reasons that i outlined
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
great thank you mr chair can i have a
 
03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
great thank you mr chair can i have a
follow-up

03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow up it's a different
 
03:25:07.990 --> 03:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
topic but i might as well get in and get
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
get off the stage um the other question
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
that i had is you know some of us have
 
03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:14.550 align:start position:0%
that i had is you know some of us have
very

03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh ambitious desires
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
for our department of energy in terms of
 
03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
for our department of energy in terms of
um

03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
addressing the science around the
 
03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
addressing the science around the
climate

03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
climate
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
issues and so my question would be
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
does the department have i've read
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like a mission but you know
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
i've read sort of what the department is
 
03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be organized to do
 
03:25:42.550 --> 03:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
and much of it is very um
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
more tactical than strategic in my
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
humble opinion so
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there are any
 
03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:51.510 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there are any
strategic

03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
goals that that are higher than just the
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
administration of the policies and
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
programs that we have
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
under uh under our under our control
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
today um anything more ambitious in
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i would think a doe would want to be
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
level setting for the state
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
more than we have had in the last
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
several years so
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
can you speak to whether that is um
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
also part of the mission sure and i'll
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
answer that question in two different
 
03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
answer that question in two different
parts

03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
parts
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh one being that the
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives
 
03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
historically has had to do with state
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
energy strategy
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
right it's this guiding document that's
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
updated every three years and
 
03:26:35.670 --> 03:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
i believe the process actually just
 
03:26:37.349 --> 03:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
kicked off
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that duty is transferred to the
 
03:26:41.190 --> 03:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy right and
 
03:26:43.190 --> 03:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
that document certainly would still be
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state's you know
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
mark in the ground every three years of
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
what the next 10 years for the energy
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
policy statewide should be
 
03:26:53.830 --> 03:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
but what i'll also say is that in the
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
current structure
 
03:26:57.990 --> 03:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
employees at osi are directly hired by
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
right so there's no governor and council
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
confirmation for the director of osi the
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
deputy director
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh the job that chris and i have
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
previously had
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
where in the department of energy all of
 
03:27:12.070 --> 03:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
those roles need to go
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
through that public process right so if
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
the executive council has
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
concerns whether it be climate change or
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
the rates
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
that you know residential customers have
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
to pay the leadership in this new entity
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
will be accountable and will have to
 
03:27:26.319 --> 03:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
will be accountable and will have to
respond

03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
respond
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
to those concerns so to whatever the
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
public policy is that new hampshire
 
03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
wants to chart forward
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think everyone can be rest assured the
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
next generation of leadership whoever
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
03:27:44.229 --> 03:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
will go through that process and will be
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
more accountable to what those public
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.229 --> 03:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:27:53.429 --> 03:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question thank you
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair i've got one that's ministerial
 
03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
then i'm more substantive what
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
the ministerial ones i can barely read
 
03:28:02.710 --> 03:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
those slides from the distance i'm from
 
03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
can we get a copy happy to do so i'll
 
03:28:06.870 --> 03:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
share the link
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
um with the chairman votes and and the
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee aide
 
03:28:15.190 --> 03:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um as you know mr mayu
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
you both you and i served on that
 
03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:18.229 align:start position:0%
you both you and i served on that
commission

03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh coming out of house bill 156
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
and it was finished its work last year
 
03:28:24.319 --> 03:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
and it was finished its work last year
and

03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
i got a distinct lack of enthusiasm from
 
03:28:29.670 --> 03:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's office about doing any
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy and now this a year
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
later we have it what what happened what
 
03:28:35.830 --> 03:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
transpired why is there
 
03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
some change of opinion here sure
 
03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:39.510 align:start position:0%
some change of opinion here sure
representative

03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you and i enjoyed working on
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
that study commission together
 
03:28:45.429 --> 03:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
um what i would say is i think the the
 
03:28:45.439 --> 03:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
um what i would say is i think the the
scope

03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
scope
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
that the 156 study commission pursued
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
was much broader
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
right if you remember some of the seats
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
on that commission was everything from
 
03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
03:28:59.190 --> 03:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
to state parks what the governor put
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
forward in his budget is a much
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
narrower interpretation of what a
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
would be comprised of right so we're
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
only looking at osi's energy components
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
and the puc you'll notice there's
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
nothing from environmental services
 
03:29:15.990 --> 03:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
from any other state agency that comes
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
into this new department
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that anything's changed
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily other than that we were able
 
03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily other than that we were able
to

03:29:25.510 --> 03:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
target the scope of this work
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
a bit more narrowly and i think that's
 
03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
a bit more narrowly and i think that's
where

03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
our support had been previously and just
 
03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we were able to
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
bring that proposal forward
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:29:42.479 --> 03:29:43.110 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
samson

03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
samson
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and if you'll
 
03:29:49.590 --> 03:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
indulge me i
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
have several questions if i can ask them
 
03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
um some are short and some are a little
 
03:29:55.520 --> 03:29:56.150 align:start position:0%
um some are short and some are a little
more

03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
extensive i guess but so number one um
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh i wanted to you mentioned that there
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the budget would increase uh based on
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
additional federal funding uh what kind
 
03:30:12.150 --> 03:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
of federal funding is that
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
and are we not getting that now is
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
does reorganizing the department energy
 
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
help us to get more funding
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't believe it's directly tied
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the organization
 
03:30:27.750 --> 03:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative i believe the increases
 
03:30:30.229 --> 03:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
come from
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
additional federal appropriations to
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
things like weatherization
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the low-income heating assistance
 
03:30:36.160 --> 03:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
and the low-income heating assistance
program

03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
those programs are very popular at the
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
and i think partially driven by just
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
increasing federal budgets
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
but also in the early days of the
 
03:30:48.640 --> 03:30:50.070 align:start position:0%
but also in the early days of the
pandemic

03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
we know the federal government
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased how much
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
heating assistance money was available
 
03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
and some of that carries forward into
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
this biennium so those dollars
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
are narrowly targeted um but
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
really just augmenting existing programs
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i i i also i'm very supportive
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the idea of a department of energy i
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea and i
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
and um i i hear uh represent platt
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
mentioning that uh
 
03:31:23.990 --> 03:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the idea has changed a little bit
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
more from
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
lukewarm to enthusiastic which is great
 
03:31:27.920 --> 03:31:28.870 align:start position:0%
lukewarm to enthusiastic which is great
um

03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would i would kind of
 
03:31:32.710 --> 03:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
criticize a little bit is the process
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
i understand that that that commission
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
did a good job and came up with ideas
 
03:31:37.359 --> 03:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
did a good job and came up with ideas
but

03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
to say that that was enough betting of
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
those ideas that you didn't have to have
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
a full-blown
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
hearing in front of our committee and
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
other similar committees before it was
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
proposed in the budget i think it's a
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
little stretching
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
the point i mean we could have had both
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't
 
03:31:58.150 --> 03:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
one or the other so um but anyway i'm
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of the whole idea now you
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
said about streamlining the system
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh that there would be some benefits and
 
03:32:04.800 --> 03:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
uh that there would be some benefits and
streamlining

03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
streamlining
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
process does that mean that some of the
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
issues that have been kind of lingering
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
for example um the long period of time
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
before people could get
 
03:32:18.389 --> 03:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
energy rebates or incentives or energy
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate this will help uh make
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
those programs more efficient
 
03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
i definitely think that will happen
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is driven by the
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory entity
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
being strictly charged with regulatory
 
03:32:35.040 --> 03:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
being strictly charged with regulatory
matters

03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
matters
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
and not needing to operate um
 
03:32:40.950 --> 03:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
those policy elements that the puc
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
currently needs to right so
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh to get a residential rebate for for
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
solar or biomass or whatever else
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have to have the whole
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory docket proceeding bringing
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
that into the department
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
makes the state more nimble obviously
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be public input in
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's much more similar to the
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
way it works at the department of
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
or any other agency that issues grants
 
03:33:10.710 --> 03:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
or rebates back
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
to members of the public being nimble
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
and being able to set specific budgets
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
and not be tied up in a regulatory
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
proceeding i think certainly will have
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
its benefits
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
similarly you mentioned the eers i think
 
03:33:29.190 --> 03:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's partially driven by having three
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners sitting again
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
right we know we're at 2 for a long time
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're very excited to have a full slate
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
of commissioners back at the puc and i
 
03:33:38.479 --> 03:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
of commissioners back at the puc and i
think

03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
those issues will move forward
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
more effectively in the future under
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
this setup in this model as well
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
whereas where does reggie fit into this
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
program isn't that under des
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
right now yeah so most of what
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
most of the regulatory elements of
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
reggie are at des
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
but the rebates are issued through the
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
03:34:06.150 --> 03:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
as a credit on bills back to ratepayers
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the nexus there there would
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
still be collaboration
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
between both def and the new department
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman hey thank you uh one last
 
03:34:19.590 --> 03:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
question please
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
all right make this one your last one we
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
got to give other people a chance yes
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
i understand uh the uh you mentioned the
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy plan that's going to be
 
03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:31.510 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy plan that's going to be
updated

03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
currently comments are supposed to be
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
submitted to osi
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you said that's going to change
 
03:34:38.950 --> 03:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be under the
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the deadline for that is june 4th
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
are you planning to extend that deadline
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
since that
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
kind of comes into this mix of what's
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
going on right now
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak to when the deadline is
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
or if it would be extended but i think
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
the intent would be to have osi complete
 
03:34:58.880 --> 03:34:59.269 align:start position:0%
the intent would be to have osi complete
this

03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh public input phase before they would
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
sunset at the end of june
 
03:35:06.389 --> 03:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
and then turn those materials over to
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
the new department to
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
carry on uh it from there but i can't
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know specifically on what the
 
03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines are okay thank you very much
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
i can actually answer that question for
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
you representative samsic at an easy
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
board meeting
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
last friday mark sanborn who
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
works currently for osi said that he
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
asking the governor's office to extend
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
the deadline for
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
public comments on the state energy
 
03:35:35.359 --> 03:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
public comments on the state energy
strategy

03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the date will be but
 
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
it will be extended
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pittsford is
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question and don't
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
forget to unmute
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the one of the things
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
that really bothers me is that recently
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
we've had an
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
incident where the governor has
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
said do not discuss a certain issue
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
at the top of this whole organizational
 
03:36:01.359 --> 03:36:02.630 align:start position:0%
at the top of this whole organizational
structure

03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the governor and council should the
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
governor decide
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
that an issue whatever that issue is
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
should not be brought up
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
either to the public utilities
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
commission or to the
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh new department of energy would that
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
hold would the governor be able to
 
03:36:26.469 --> 03:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
editing on a particular agency
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that has happened and that really is
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
a concern of me
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
because there are some things that may
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
never happen but
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
they deserve discussion so can somebody
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm not specifically sure what you
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
might be referring to representative
 
03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
callie pitts
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
i can say unequivocally the governor
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
would never have authority over
 
03:36:56.790 --> 03:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
a regulatory proceeding so any docket
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's open at the puc the governor
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
can't communicate with those
 
03:36:59.760 --> 03:37:01.429 align:start position:0%
can't communicate with those
commissioners

03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
outside of a hearing room the same way
 
03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
that none of us can
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
right the governor doesn't have a
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
as for agency heads obviously agency
 
03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:13.349 align:start position:0%
as for agency heads obviously agency
heads

03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
heads
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether it be department of business
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
economic affairs or cultural resources
 
03:37:17.279 --> 03:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
economic affairs or cultural resources
or

03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
a new department of energy they would
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
report to the governor
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
um as members of the executive branch
 
03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:25.990 align:start position:0%
um as members of the executive branch
but

03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know what you might be referring
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
to as far as far as editing goes
 
03:37:34.469 --> 03:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
well may i yes follow up
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
i did not want to bring up a specific
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
incident but the des was recently told
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
not to discuss a certain program
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
and whether a program is good or not
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
good sometimes it
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
it needs discussion so at the top of
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
the way i see it and stop me if i'm
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
wrong is the governor
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
and if the governor doesn't want
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
something to be discussed or doesn't
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
want a docket to be open
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
can he tell the osi
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
or the order uh department of energy
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to even deal with that
 
03:38:15.269 --> 03:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh so the governor certainly couldn't
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
stop a docket from being opened
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
um as for what policies the state
 
03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:25.110 align:start position:0%
um as for what policies the state
pursues

03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
pursues
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
any chief executive does have you know
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
some discretion
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
obviously within the bounds of the law
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
and and the governor ultimately is
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
accountable to the voters on those
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:42.790 --> 03:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
but i think that's all just in the
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
normal course of government
 
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
that different chief executives would
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
pursue different policies but obviously
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're all bound by the laws that are
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
written by the legislature enacted by
 
03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:56.150 align:start position:0%
written by the legislature enacted by
the

03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
executive and upheld by the courts
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
can i one more follow okay if i can just
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
interject the issue the specific issue
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about which was
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
373 the senate actually
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
amended house bill 373 to take the
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
governor out of the picture
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
and made the executive council the
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh adjudicating body for
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
that issue for that issue but i just
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know about that
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead and ask thank you the the other
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
again the puc is is a quasi-judicial
 
03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:38.229 align:start position:0%
again the puc is is a quasi-judicial
branch

03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
branch
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
and should be separate from any
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
should be separate from any political
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
persuasion so
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
are you saying to me that under this new
 
03:39:46.479 --> 03:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
are you saying to me that under this new
structure

03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
the governor would have no influence
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
over what the uh puc decides
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to tell them i
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'll say that unequiv unequivocally yes
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative and i think that's one of
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the most important reasons why pursuing
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
this policy change
 
03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
is so vital because
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
when the puc is not only adjudicating
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
but also
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
setting policy things like residential
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
rebates or the renewable portfolio
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
standard and things like that
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
um you know though there there is a
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
blurring of of what you know they're
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
responsible to the governor for
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
or not in this new structure there's a
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
bright red line that if it's regulatory
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
and it's at the puc
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a black box but if it's at the
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
department and its policy
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
things that are in the normal course of
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
what an executive branch agency would do
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
those are the areas where there could be
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
communication right if there's a
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
constituent issue
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
um with obtaining a rebate for for solar
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and citizen
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
services could facilitate that
 
03:40:59.590 --> 03:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
in a way that at the pc it's currently
 
03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:01.349 align:start position:0%
in a way that at the pc it's currently
structured

03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
structured
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's a very uncertain conversation
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
depending on what dockets are open or
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
but certainly no regulatory interference
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
with any open docket
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
and again we think that this proposal
 
03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:14.950 align:start position:0%
and again we think that this proposal
clarifies

03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
and only strengthens that barrier
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative kelly
 
03:41:22.399 --> 03:41:23.189 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative kelly
pitts

03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
pitts
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair recognizing representative
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
oxendine for a question
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
you mr mayor for taking my question
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
um currently the puc
 
03:41:40.150 --> 03:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
has regulatory matters on its dockets
 
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
but it also has what i
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
would consider policy issues like
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
um how best to advance energy storage um
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
grid mods uh you know
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
various things are are things like that
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to be taken away from them and
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
handled at the doe or will they still
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
have those sort of
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
two different areas of expertise
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
underneath of them
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
well i think what i would say on that
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative and that's a great
 
03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:09.189 align:start position:0%
representative and that's a great
question

03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
especially for ongoing investigations
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll use the statewide energy
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
platform from senate bill 286
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
from two years ago right now the puc is
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
it has an open docket as to whether or
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
not that's
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
costs beneficial or in the public
 
03:42:26.160 --> 03:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
costs beneficial or in the public
interest

03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
the way that the language is written
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
into hb2 is that
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
the puc is the arbiter the way the
 
03:42:34.950 --> 03:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
statute was written
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
to decide if it is something the state
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
should do
 
03:42:40.309 --> 03:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then the department of energy would
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
be the implementer
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
of a proposal like that when it comes to
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
things like time of use rates or
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency or anything else
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
things that would need to
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
be incorporated into the utility tariff
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
right the puc
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate arbiter of that but i do
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
think that the doe
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be the entity with both the
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
resources the expertise and the duty
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
as it's envisioned in hb2
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of the legwork on things
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
like that so if it's
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
new rate structures that the state may
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
want to pursue as a matter of public
 
03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:19.189 align:start position:0%
want to pursue as a matter of public
policy

03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
the department would present that case
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
through a docket to the commission
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and the commission again would issue an
 
03:43:26.319 --> 03:43:26.870 align:start position:0%
and the commission again would issue an
order

03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
either granting or or denying
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
that type of a proposal follow up
 
03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you very much um
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
let's take for an example the net
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
metering docket which has been ongoing
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
for a while a lot of money has been
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
invested in
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
pilots and studies and at some point
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the very near future
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
they're going to be coming to an outcome
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
um that because it's ongoing that will
 
03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:55.349 align:start position:0%
um that because it's ongoing that will
proceed

03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
i unders as i understand you that would
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
proceed entirely within the pucs
 
03:44:03.990 --> 03:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
purview the puc would have to issue the
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
final order
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
on what those rates would be right any
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
rate setting
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
matter is for the commission to decide
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
um the department of energy might be the
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
ones that coordinate
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
with the consultants and the different
 
03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know contractors that have been
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
brought in to do those analyses
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
because again the department staff would
 
03:44:25.279 --> 03:44:25.830 align:start position:0%
because again the department staff would
present

03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the evidence and the
 
03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:29.349 align:start position:0%
the uh the evidence and the
justification

03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
justification
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
from the state's purview but
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
the department employees would never be
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
advising the commission on how they
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
should rule
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
right so there is that division of
 
03:44:40.960 --> 03:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
right so there is that division of
responsibility

03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
who is presenting the case and who is uh
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
deciding what the outcome would be
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the bright red line that
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we're um
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
proposing through this reorganization
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
into the department of energy
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question i guess in
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
fewer words the puc would decide what
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
the net metering rate is
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
um but the department might be doing
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
some of the work uh preparing what that
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
follow up just to clarify okay uh make
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
this your
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
your last one thank you thank you um
 
03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
so even though this is an ongoing
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding we're going to be
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
changing how it's we mean the rfp is
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
already out the consultant's already
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
hired they're going to come back with
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
their information
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the doe people who will
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
take that information and then
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
present it to the puc rather than that
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
information going directly to the puc
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh i can't speak to that specific
 
03:45:41.920 --> 03:45:42.630 align:start position:0%
uh i can't speak to that specific
instance

03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
instance
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day the puc will
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
be the entity that decides
 
03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
what net metering rates would be thank
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
you but i
 
03:45:53.110 --> 03:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't know enough about the specific
 
03:45:54.070 --> 03:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
details of that
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
pending docket other than that the puc
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
will be the ones that make their final
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.389 --> 03:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel is recognized
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
03:46:15.910 --> 03:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
mr miller you mentioned that part of the
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
funding for the new
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
department of energy is coming from
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
the reggie funds and
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
currently the reggie funds either go
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
a small portion of it goes back to the
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and the rest
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
goes to i think new hampshire saves is
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be a new tap on that
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
fund no no so there it wouldn't be a new
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
tap on it my comments there
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
are just to say that because the
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
department is the pass-through
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
right the department receives those
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
dollars from the auction
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
and then issues rebates back to
 
03:46:59.199 --> 03:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
and then issues rebates back to
customers

03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
customers
 
03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
that appears on the state's books as
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
both the revenue
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
right the source from the auction and an
 
03:47:07.199 --> 03:47:07.910 align:start position:0%
right the source from the auction and an
expense

03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
expense
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of that grant or that rebate
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
but there wouldn't be any new
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
administrative draw
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
on those funds
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
just that the department facilitates
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
that transaction essentially
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay my my concern
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh just to follow up mr chairman
 
03:47:32.309 --> 03:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
but my concern is that if in fact
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that revenue from reggie is being
 
03:47:36.239 --> 03:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
that that revenue from reggie is being
used

03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
used
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
for administrative purposes uh even if
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's a small percentage
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
the concern is like so many other things
 
03:47:45.439 --> 03:47:46.389 align:start position:0%
the concern is like so many other things
where

03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state has a tap to for funds whether
 
03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:50.870 align:start position:0%
the state has a tap to for funds whether
it's

03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the uh property tax or
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
sales taxes that
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
get diverted from one thing to
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
balancing the state budget and that's my
 
03:48:10.950 --> 03:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
only concern
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
so and representative let me see if i
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
can allay some of your concerns there
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
just to say that while the entity that
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
administers it is changing
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
there are no changes to the eligible
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
uses for those funds
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
or any of that existing uh
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that goes to administer
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
this right so all we're really doing is
 
03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:33.510 align:start position:0%
this right so all we're really doing is
changing

03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
changing
 
03:48:36.070 --> 03:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
the name of who does it but not what it
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
can be used for what's allowed
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
and with any dedicated fund in the state
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's prescribed
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
and restricted to a specific purpose
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
so would never be going to be used to
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
balance a budget
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:48:52.239 --> 03:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
representative

03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative mann you had your hand up
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
no i got answered thank you okay thank
 
03:49:01.760 --> 03:49:02.070 align:start position:0%
no i got answered thank you okay thank
you

03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you have a question
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
it was just a follow-up on the reggie
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
again didn't
 
03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
the last uh auction didn't we end up
 
03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:13.429 align:start position:0%
the last uh auction didn't we end up
with

03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
a significantly higher amount paid in
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
the last quarter than we were
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
used to i thought it was significantly
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
higher like
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
from 14 to 21 or something like that so
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
bigger chunk of money that's in that um
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
kitty right now right is that true
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
that is true and i think that here
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the department's analysis
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
the current biennium revenues totaled
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
16.5 million
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 20 and 12.7 in fiscal 21
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
the department is estimating 20.8
 
03:49:53.110 --> 03:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
million each year
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
in the next two years so yes the
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
significant increase is what they're
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh projecting to see come into the state
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
through that auction
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
and again that's both a revenue and also
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
an expense
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh any further questions
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative mann you have your
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess um
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
my point of view is that energy and the
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
environment are very closely related
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the the uh the whole reggie the use
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
of reggie funds
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
and the uh addition of systems benefits
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
charge funds
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's outside the department is that
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
correct that's
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
you guys administer it but policy is
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
made elsewhere
 
03:50:48.150 --> 03:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
like by the way yeah so certainly
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislative policy has a large role to
 
03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
legislative policy has a large role to
play

03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
play
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
des addresses a lot of the compliance
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
side of that program
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
and the puc currently or the department
 
03:50:59.429 --> 03:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
in this new reorganization be the one
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
administering those funds
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether it be to energy efficiency or
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
and again no change to how that all
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
operates other than that it's going from
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy
 
03:51:21.269 --> 03:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
um follow-up go ahead
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you by
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
the way matthew for
 
03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
it does seem to me that the rebates to
 
03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:35.189 align:start position:0%
it does seem to me that the rebates to
the

03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
ratepayers is um a sort of a historical
 
03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:39.590 align:start position:0%
ratepayers is um a sort of a historical
accident

03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
accident
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh that happened a few years ago and is
 
03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:43.189 align:start position:0%
uh that happened a few years ago and is
the

03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
reggie funds were originally intended to
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
be used pretty much entirely for
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
um environmental issues so um
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's no hard um
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
again that decision on exactly how
 
03:51:57.990 --> 03:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's gonna that money
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
should be used whether it should be
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
rebated or turned into
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
funding for the environment
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's outside your scope the scope of
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
the department correct
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct that is all prescribed by
 
03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i would never refer to any
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation as a historical accident
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a very rigorous
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
process but yes it is all prescribed by
 
03:52:25.030 --> 03:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislation how those dollars flow
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
to any of their given endpoints okay
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative um
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you have your hand
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
up you have another question or is that
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
a leftover
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
no i i left it up because i wanted to
 
03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
just remind
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh mr melo that he had mentioned
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to sending us the slides
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
which were requested that he might send
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
along that memo from commissioner martin
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i would appreciate that so i just
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
had a little note here and i thought i'd
 
03:52:58.950 --> 03:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
mention it before we conclude
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
happy to do it thanks thanks thanks for
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
that reminder
 
03:53:06.150 --> 03:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
are there any additional questions from
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%

to the committee we really appreciate
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%

appreciate it you guys have a great day
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
we are done let's take up one more
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
issue before we adjourn for the day
 
03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
well i don't need you now if you have
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
familiarity with something called a
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
doodle poll
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
would you raise your hand and i don't
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
mean your uh
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
your zoom hand but your regular hand
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'll pick up the girl
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you see me when i'm on
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the side
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay i guess some people know what a
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
doodle pole is the reason i'm asking
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
is because we could use a doodle pool to
 
03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:07.510 align:start position:0%
is because we could use a doodle pool to
determine

03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not june 7th june 14th or
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
june 21st
 
03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
or some combination of those three might
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
be a good time to get together for
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh a work session on retained bills
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
try to put together a doodle poll
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
although i will admit i've never done
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
that before
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to i i've used them but
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
i've never actually constructed one
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to do that and i'll
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
send it to all of you
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
which of those three dates or maybe all
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
of them will work for
 
03:54:44.229 --> 03:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
future work sessions and then we'll go
 
03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
from there representative partial
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment don't forget to
 
03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment don't forget to
unmute

03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:55:32.710 --> 03:55:32.720 align:start position:0%

03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh being here today i think we've

concluded our business
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
for this uh session of the biennium
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
the only matters still before us will be
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
house sessions on june 3rd
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
june 4th june 10th and june
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
i will very likely be concurring on
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
315 the changes made by the senate and
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
also on house bill
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
373 they made a minor change
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
as well to that bill so we'll probably
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
concur on those
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
and and we'll be done and it's been a
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
great year
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
i've enjoyed working with you all zoom
 
03:56:17.189 --> 03:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
has made it a little bit
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
odd at times but we got through it and
 
03:56:19.920 --> 03:56:20.229 align:start position:0%
odd at times but we got through it and
so

03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh thanks to you all i look forward to
 
03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%

sports complex in bedford representative
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
callie pitts
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
i have a question on the concurrences
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
because that it really bothers me
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
when you concur on a bill do you concur
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes and if the committee does not
 
03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:44.710 align:start position:0%
yes yes and if the committee does not
concur

03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
concur
 
03:56:46.150 --> 03:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
or a piece of the committee doesn't
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
concur according to house rules the
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
decision to concur
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
non-concur or request a committee of
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
conference is the committee chair's
 
03:56:54.880 --> 03:56:56.550 align:start position:0%
conference is the committee chair's
responsibility

03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is and and
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
precedence has been in this committee
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
that when that's done the committee has
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
always been consulted
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about it what do you do
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
do you agree with this
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh because it's not a unilateral
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i i'm gonna express my feelings that
 
03:57:16.720 --> 03:57:17.349 align:start position:0%
i i i'm gonna express my feelings that
that

03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have always been told this is what
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to concur on and this is
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
what it's about
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
right and do you agree with the
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
concurrence or don't you the final
 
03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
concurrence or don't you the final
decision

03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:57:30.150 --> 03:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
is the chairs but the chair usually
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
consults with the rest of the committee
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying and that's been 23
 
03:57:34.720 --> 03:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying and that's been 23
years

03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and that's why i brought it
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
up and discussed it
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
to get a sense of of whether anybody had
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
any objections to concurrence i didn't
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
