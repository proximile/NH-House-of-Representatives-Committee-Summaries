representative

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
PL this uh bill I think is premature in
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
my view uh something we may very well
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
have to do but I'd rather have the
 
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
courts get through their processes first
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
I do remember the Brew I was before my
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
time but there was a brewhaha among
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
several towns calling themselves donor
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
towns and uh I'd rather avoid that
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
unless you if we had a court order the
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
forcing us to uh it might be more it
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
might be better than doing it right now
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative spillsbury thank you
 
00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:43.950 align:start position:0%
okay representative spillsbury thank you
Mr

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
chairman so just to review for everybody
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are actually six Bills currently
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the legislature this session relating
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
to swept in one form or
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
another and so I just want our
 
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
peripheral vision to be open Beware of
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
the other bills and I'm going to
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned them briefly uh
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
1686 which was uh introduced by March
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
Smith and I'm one of the co-sponsors
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
went to the education
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
committee and it deals specifically with
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
the same subject as
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
1514 and that is what to do with the
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
excess swep in about I believe there's
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
about 26 so-called donor communities
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
that collect more in swept than would be
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
due to them in state adequacy aid and so
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's about $29
 
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.629 align:start position:0%
there's about $29
million

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that bill was uh taken to the floor
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago without recommendation and
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
tabled uh all leave representative Ames
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
to describe uh what's in his bill that
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
we tabled uh
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
earlier uh excuse me put into interim
 
00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.070 align:start position:0%
earlier uh excuse me put into interim
study

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
earlier and uh he also has a component
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's in representative luno um bill
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
which was put into interim study also so
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
education has taken two bills one that's
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
on this subject one that includes a
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
component on the subject and put both
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
into interim
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
study and then we have this
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
bill um representative fellows
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh also the one that we already
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
put in interim study I think that it
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
only makes sense to put this bill into
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
interim study also but then have a
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
session in the
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
fall perhaps the litigation is
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
further I think it's a bit optimistic to
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
think that the Supreme New Hampshire
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has uh uh ruled on appeals
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
at that stage but we'll be
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
closer and I think that ultimately the
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty with this subject is that it
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
pits some towns against other other s
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll be frank mine my town uh
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
Charles Town and the other towns I
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
represent including unity and
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.949 align:start position:0%
represent including unity and
particularly

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
Newport um struggle mightily to fund
 
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:13.870 align:start position:0%
Newport um struggle mightily to fund
local

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
education Charles toown has the second
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
highest real estate tax rate in the
 
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.310 align:start position:0%
highest real estate tax rate in the
state

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.230 align:start position:0%
state
3411

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
3411
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
Mills um our education our local Ed
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
20.93% six for local Ed alone so I
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
think I view this in two
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
ways on the one hand our current swept
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of a
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
fraud it uh it's a sham it it suggests
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to pick up more
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the education
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
cost to alleviate the burden on local
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
property tax and how are they going to
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
do it by searching local property
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
change

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
however the problem with this specific
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and what it's trying to attack is
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
that it's got a conflict and I'm very
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
towns that have collected excess
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
swept sometimes to the tune of several
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars for example molten
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
Boro and uh and this bill asks them
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
to just mail it on
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
in that's a tough thing to ask them to
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
do what I think we ultimately need to do
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
is restructure this completely and I
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
know that representative fellows
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ames are working on that
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in the education
 
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in the education
funding

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee January and February uh
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
where we focused a fair bit on that and
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think the focus of that
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
effort May center around representative
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
luno bill in education I think that this
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be part of a bigger Grand
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
bargain and I think it's something we
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
can work on and help shape in the fall
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's going to be ready
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
for action until next year so that's
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
just my take it Demands a solution the
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
courts have said it's
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but that doesn't
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean this is the right
 
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean this is the right
vehicle

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you to representative
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
spillsbury I think that was a good
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
overview um and
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
I I'd say bottom line I share in the uh
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
thought that uh we need to work on
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
this um some more and that the interim
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
study vehicle is the essentially the
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
only one we have
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
to not put aside this bill but put it
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
process um where it will join other
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
bills and um we have to understand that
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
we in this Committee in conjunction with
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
the education committee and the finance
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee need to find a way of working
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
in a serious and thoughtful way to
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
achieve a u both a a full understanding
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
of the options this is a good option
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
here but is not by no means uh I'm
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
referring to House Bill 1514 by no no
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
means is it a
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh response but it the
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
idea of a local contribution is uh is um
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
an important idea that we need to look
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
at um I I think uh having having said
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
that I think it's we have an opportunity
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
we have guests here in the audience who
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh know a great deal about pieces of
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
this puzzle that we're trying to put
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
together uh the Attorney General's
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
office is here and um Dr is here um and
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know myself what the
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
latest understanding of the uh requests
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
for stays in the litigation is uh from
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office um if
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
there's no stay well we're under the gun
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
and we uh maybe we're not uh directly in
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
the line of fire but we we will be um
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
and um with respect to
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Dr um the question of swept and how it's
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
handled uh if there are questions about
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
that we should explore them while we've
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
got an opportunity
 
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
got an opportunity
um

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
you anyone else before we invite okay
 
00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.069 align:start position:0%
you anyone else before we invite okay
yes

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
would just like to um add that if we
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
were to keep this bill it would need
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
some work done to it because there are
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
some technical issues particularly
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
related to timing of how how the state
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
would go about
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
um processing receiving and processing
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
the excess and the fiscal note Dr uh
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
cover covered some of that and I what I
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
see is
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
a a timing issue it it would need the
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
spill would need some a significant
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
amount of work to get it to do the
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
intent thank you representative
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um I believe that the
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court being the last court of
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
authority on this on is going to be as
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
19998 I think it was when they told us
 
00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
19998 I think it was when they told us
in

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
December that and we were going to have
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
to solve education
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
funding um and give us in into next year
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
to figure this out
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
um I presume that they are going to act
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
by then so
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
on keeping the bills that some of the
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
bills the bills that make the most sense
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
within a particular category um and
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
working on them seems like a much better
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess we'd have to do it as inter
 
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.749 align:start position:0%
um I guess we'd have to do it as inter
from

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
study um than trying to do something
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
now that may or may not be something
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
that the court would think would be
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you uh yes represent
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
El thank you Mr chairman I reluctantly
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
agree um I think the fundamental
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
question that we're that we need to look
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
at is who is responsible for educating
 
00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.110 align:start position:0%
at is who is responsible for educating
our

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
children do we see the community that
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
it's based on as being limited by
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
geographical Borders or do we say that
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
the entire state has a commitment to
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
educating all of our
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
children and I'm hoping that the courts
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
will give us some clarity on that and
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
the interim study will as well thank you
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're going to invite
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
up uh Department of Justice and uh ask a
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
this is uh Sam garland from the
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice nice to see you
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
all again thank you Mr Garland um
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ames would you like to
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
ask a question of uh Mr
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
Garland yeah
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
um what's the
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
latest from last week um so since our
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
meeting last week which point uh there
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
was a motion to stay that we had filed
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
at the Supreme Court um the plaintiffs
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
have objected to that motion they had
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
been directed to do so by the Supreme
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
Court by 3M on Thursday and they
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
objected actually Wednesday night so the
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
motion is briefed in pending with the
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
court um uh Senate President Bradley has
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
also filed um a motion for leave to
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
appear as an amus in support of our
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
motion to stay and has filed a motion or
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me a memorandum in support of
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
that position as well um just last night
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
I believe the the plane of subjected to
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
the request for for him to participate
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
as an amicus and that that remains
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
pending with the court as well um we
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
don't have a ruling from the court
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
sitting here right now or at least we
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
didn't as of of 10 minutes ago the last
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
time I checked um the Supreme Court did
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
order that the plaintiffs respond U more
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly than the court rules would have
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise allowed they they requested
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
their response um several days before uh
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
the the the normal deadline that would
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
have existed under the rules um it's
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
always dangerous to read Court te leaves
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
but I do tend to think that suggests
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court is looking at
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
this it it knows the Motions pending and
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's taking it seriously um but sitting
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
here today there's there's no ruling yet
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
in the conval motion to stay um in the
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
Rand case the the case involving U more
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
directly the swept um the Coalition
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
communities have filed both a notice of
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
appeal and a motion to stay the order um
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
the trial Court's order there uh we
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
received the motion to stay at the end
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
of last week and we're assessing that
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
internally at the Department of Justice
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh no response has been filed to that
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
yet and the Supreme Court hasn't taken
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
yet any anyone else have questions from
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
Mr G yes
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
follow um so the other question and you
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
you spoke to this before but uh now
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
you've had more activity
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
um relates to the timeline for uh
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
referenced by representa only uh for
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
maybe getting to a uh let's let's assume
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
a stay
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that the court then um um rolls up
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
its sleeves and addresses the issues
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
that are raised in both cases
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
um any sense of I I know it's unfair but
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
any sense of of a of how long that's
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to take um thank you
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ames so so it's hard to
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
to predict exactly the time frame on
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
that both because it it we don't have a
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
even a briefing schedule yet in either
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the cases and these are complicated
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
issues that the court obviously we
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
expect to take seriously and will
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
require some some deliberation um
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking once we file a notice
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
of appeal which will be due next week
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
the The Briefing schedule would come
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
within the next 30 or so days if no
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
party seeks to expedite to the appeal
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
and you know I assume all parties are
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
considering whether it makes sense to do
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that there's there's a tension between
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
Expediting an appeal of the sort to get
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
an answer but making sure that the
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
parties in the court have the time uh to
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
consider it as as as much time as as
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
necessary um once the appeal is fully
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
briefed um typically a brief would the
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
initial brief would be due 30 days after
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
the briefing order a follow-up brief or
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
an answering brief would be due 30 days
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
after that there'd be some time for a
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
reply if there were no extensions so
 
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.230 align:start position:0%
reply if there were no extensions so
we're

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
talking two and a half to three months
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
just for briefing the Supreme Court
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
would almost certainly hold an oral
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
argument in a case such as this um or in
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
cases such as this they did back in 2019
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
when the conval case was up there before
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
and obviously have and just about every
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont in in London da case that was
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
before the court as well and then after
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
that the the ball is really in the
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's hands to determine how
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
long um it takes to to draft an opinion
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
and you know we've seen opinions as
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
quickly as a month or two in in certain
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
cases and opinions can take over a year
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
and it depends really on how long the
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um takes to deliberate and
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
draft an opinion that a ma majority of
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
the justices um are comfortable with and
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
so that that is a non answer to your
 
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
question but but the short the most
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
direct answer is it is certainly a
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
matter of months and and appeals it's
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for them to take you know
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
upwards of a year um I think everyone on
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
our end and on the plaintiff's end and
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
and I assume on the Court's end too
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
understands the importance of this issue
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
and understands that the legislature um
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
has had to Grapple with it in the past
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
is grappling with it now I don't think
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's lost on anyone and so to the
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
extent that has an influence on on the
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
timing um and it certainly may that
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's that remains to be
 
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
that's that remains to be
seen

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
all right anybody
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you oh did you
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
have a question I just wondered how
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
would um a regular citizen keep track of
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
all these steps if if they if they
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
happen to have enough um knowledge of
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
the law to understand what they even
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean for sure so there are a couple of
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
different ways um representative fellows
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um the
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um has a an efiling system
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
that allows uh people who have the
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
ability to to to sign in and so attorne
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys can sign up for signin
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
information um but I believe and I don't
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to overstate this but I believe
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
that any member of the public can to or
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
at least can track a case where you can
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
access the briefing you can certainly do
 
00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
so at a kiosk at the Supreme Court but I
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
believe there's there's an online way to
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
do it as well um sometimes the Supreme
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
Court will post uh the the the relevant
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
filings on its website depending on the
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
case that's within the Court's
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
discretion and I'm not aware of it
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
having done so here um and then more
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
generally the the Press has been
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
tracking these cases very closely for
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
the the the fulltime that the conval
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
case has been pending since 2019 and so
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
there have certainly been um Regular
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
press updates um up to including you
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
know our most recent filings in our
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
meeting last week um that that are
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
keeping fairly close track of the
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you um okay okay thank
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
you does anyone have should we bring Dr
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
up does anyone have specific questions
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Keen M Wong TX
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
policy council with the
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
Dr my name is Bruce canu I'm the
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the municipal Bureau at
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
Dr okay my my question is
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh is relates to when Dr will be issuing
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
updated um reports on
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy and um and uh if you're doing
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
it equ and Equalization ratios for the
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what I see on on
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
the uh uh internet is um on your
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
site is um that in the
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh spreadsheets and
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
calculations the uh where property
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
valuations play a part now um the
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
property valuations that are used used
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
and the equalization ratios that are
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
used are uh derive based on uh April 15
 
00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:38.909 align:start position:0%
used are uh derive based on uh April 15
222

00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
222
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
2022 um values and
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
un understand that those values would
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
have been picked up a year later or so
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
but now we're
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
into another we're into April
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
momentarily is that when we're going to
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
get updated updated Equalization
 
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.029 align:start position:0%
get updated updated Equalization
ratios

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative Ames um
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
the equalization
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
ratios necessary for uh a portioning the
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
the the State education
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
tax are developed from the local
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
assessed values which came into Dr last
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
fall and that Equalization process
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
hasn't until May 1st of this year so the
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
2023 equalized values are still in
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
process um and you are correct that the
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
the swept warrants that are
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
currently uh in the hands of the
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities um utilized the most
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
recent available equalized values at the
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
time which as you noted were the uh
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
the local values from
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
2022 that were finalized as equalized
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
2023 and at this point
 
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.430 align:start position:0%
2023 and at this point
[Music]

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
um under normal and current conditions
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
and and and so forth
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the next swept
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
warrants would begin their uh process of
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
being calculated and created sometime
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
after May of this year when those 2023
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
equalized values have been um um
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
forwarded and the the short period of
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
appeal by municipalities is concluded so
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
generally by around early
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
June that's where we stand um today as
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
we sit here um follow follow
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
up um
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
so the intersection with doe uh doe
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
picks up the information from Dr it
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
includes it in its calculations I see
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
Mr I don't dare say your last name Sir
 
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.029 align:start position:0%
Mr I don't dare say your last name Sir
Mark

00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
Mark
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
M something like that way off um picks
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
up doe picks up um your values and um
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
how soon after
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
you well the values that show up right
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
now are April
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
2022 that's the the indicator and I
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
understand that there's another year of
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
processing I think anyway um when do
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
they pick up the new
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
values well if we want to go back to the
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
the process that's already been
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
concluded uh in like I said May of 2023
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
the 202 two local assessed values had
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
been equalized at that point Dr can
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
calculate um the swept
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
taxes and that data or that information
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
is then shared with uh Mark and his team
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
at at
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
education for use in um the work of the
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid estimates for the next year
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
so at this point uh the equalized values
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
that helped create the swept warrants
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
that are out right
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
now were utilized by education and and
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure um if needed Mark can and
 
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
I'm sure um if needed Mark can and
confirm

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
or further expand on this they were
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
utilized last fall as education had to
 
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.039 align:start position:0%
get ready to give the districts the
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
estimate of of um adequacy for what is
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
now the fiscal Year we're we're
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
in so at this point again what would
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
happen in the spring under existing law
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
is that Equalization would be finalized
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
sometime in May of this year uh the
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
municipal Bureau team would begin the
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
process of calculating what would be the
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
swept warrants used in
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
2025 and when we have that data
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
developed we'd be able to share it with
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
education for use in their work in
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
developing the next set of adequacy
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
estimates so it's it's an ongoing
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
process where in effect at times you
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
have um one swept already developed and
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
in having been forward and soon
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
thereafter the next process is
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
beginning okay I understand that thank
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
you um I just want a comment the reason
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
why this is so important why I'm asking
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
this question is that these values
 
00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
this question is that these values
change

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
and uh real estate values particularly
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
changed significantly over the last
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
several years so that
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
um there will be a change and sometimes
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
it will be significant some communities
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
have gone way up um and
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
um as we and then they factor into
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
what's important to us which is um How
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh much money a school district is going
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
to get and that's related to ratios like
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
the ratio of free and reduced price
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
lunch kids to the equalized value in a
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
particular Town um and both of those
 
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
particular Town um and both of those
numbers

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
are difficult to pin down these days but
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's why it's important and that's
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
why I'm pursuing this and uh I would
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
like to hear for a moment from Mark M um
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
about uh his uh the numbers he's using
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
and when he hopes to have the next set
 
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.389 align:start position:0%
and when he hopes to have the next set
of

00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
numbers representa
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
elme before that could I ask another
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
question to Mr caner yes sure
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh we for two three years now have been
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
in a situation where fewer and fewer
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
houses were being sold at higher and
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
higher ridiculously higher
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
prices how have you dealt with that in
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
out particularly I
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
on well in any case you're going to have
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of houses that are never
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to sell for those prices but which
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
are equivalent to the ones that are are
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
being sold for 500,000
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
1 million 5 million uh and at some point
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
this bubble is going to
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
burst at least if not we're all stuck in
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
the same places we've been in for a very
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
long time about I don't know what
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population that is but
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
high thank you representative Aly um I'm
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
not qualified to address the specific
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
question uh that work is done in the
 
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.590 align:start position:0%
question uh that work is done in the
equalization

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
equalization
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau and I am not trained in that
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
science as a were so I don't I do so you
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
aren't the head of the equalization
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
Bureau no um no I'm not but um I'm sorry
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
that is he is he in Dr she he it at at
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
this point it would probably uh want to
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
be assistant director denor or director
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
green who would address Equalization
 
00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.950 align:start position:0%
green who would address Equalization
specific

00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative fellows um
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um Mr canor I think one of
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
the things that you said when you were
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
trying to go through all the years you
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
can you speak into the microphone when
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
when you were doing all the different
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
steps yes is I I heard you refer to um
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
setting the tax rates but I think that
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
at that point it was actually the
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
warrants that are going out and there's
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
a distinction between the warrants say
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
how much is needs to be raised from
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
taxes in the ensuing year the rates
 
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
taxes in the ensuing year the rates
don't

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
actually are not actually set
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
until shortly before people get their
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
start to get their bills their tax bills
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
their estimated tax bills thank you
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellows if I might I'll
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
just return to where we are right now
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
there are warrants in the hands of the
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to raise a certain amount
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
of swept taxes in their
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
municipality for from Municipal bureau's
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
perspective we're talking about the tax
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
rates that will be set this
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
fall um again it is a long process from
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
the time the original locally assessed
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
values come into uh Dr in the fall of
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
2022 creating warrants that are are
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to be used um to equalize values
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
that will be available in May of
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
2023 helping create warrants that will
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
be used in
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
2024 on 2024 you know final tax rates
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
this fall so it is a long process and
 
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
during which again it cycles and begins
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
again so
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's it gets um decently complicated to
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
try and explain I know without a
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
timeline in front of all of us
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
so the warrants that are out right now
 
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
for argument sake in in a hypothetical
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
municipality to raise a specific amount
 
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.550 align:start position:0%
municipality to raise a specific amount
of

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
dollars that will be reflected in the
 
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.870 align:start position:0%
dollars that will be reflected in the
tax

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
municipality okay um yes represent
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
spillsbury thank you Mr chairman I'd
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
just like to clarify two things
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if this bill 1514 was
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
passed in this session it has an
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
effective date of July 1
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
2024 so the earliest that this would
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
have any impact is in the cycle that
 
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.630 align:start position:0%
have any impact is in the cycle that
leads

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
leads
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
towards uh the warrants that are set in
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
May of 25
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
right I'm just talking about timing
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
right um if the law went into effect
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
July 1 then we would operate under the
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
new law in preparing the Warr the swept
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
warrants that would be issued by the
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner by December 15 and be used
 
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.390 align:start position:0%
commissioner by December 15 and be used
in

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
2025 right and because those um those
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
figures are set in May it would affect
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
the taxes that are set in November of 25
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's how far lag time we're
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
talking about corre the second thing I
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify is
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
that this specific question regarding
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
what happens with excess swept the bill
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
proposes that excess swept is no longer
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
retained in the towns it's sent to the
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
state does not change the amount of the
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
swep which is 363 million does not
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
change the allocation to the various
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
towns based on um equalized
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
valuation does not change the amount
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
that each town has to raise off of their
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
real estate taxes it only changes the
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
disposition of the more or less 29
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
million aggregated excess swept from the
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
various towns that have an excess
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
and the 29
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
million more or
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
less does not go back into the same pot
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
and rearrange
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the $363 million
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
burden it just goes into the education
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
trust fund goes back into the open pool
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I want wanting to lay this
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
out and ask you do I have it right um
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
this does not change and will not in the
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
future change the allocation of the
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
swept dollars and the burden that each
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
tax thank you representative bilsbury
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
yes you have you have outlined it
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
correctly okay um and I'd just like to
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
make a a third observation and that is
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's generally understood that the
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
swept tax is a fixed amount for every
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
town but in fact the whole process of
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
applying the equalized valuation results
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
in different rates so the Statewide
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
average is
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
a122 in my town in Charlestown for for
 
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:29.079 align:start position:0%
example it takes
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
a145 per thousand to raise that so the
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
the amount that each town uh ends up
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
taxing in this process does vary and and
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the the fuling point of that
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
variation is whether you're property
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
poor property Rich relatively speaking
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
so that $145 in the case of Charlestown
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
2096

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
2096
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I was I was going beyond my
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
question to you okay that's that's more
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
of a comment to the committee thank you
 
00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:07.470 align:start position:0%
of a comment to the committee thank you
okay

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
um okay um let's um I think we're
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
getting to the point where we'll take
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
one more question from representative
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
elme Al this is just a question of so
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
you said the director of Dr or the
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
assistant director Diane Kerr I didn't
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
get the name uh the assistant director
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
is Adam
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
denor there is why I didn't get the G
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
r thank you and he runs the equalization
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau which I can't
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
find except a brief description of what
 
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
find except a brief description of what
it

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
does uh at at present um the
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
equalization Bureau um questions should
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
be directed to either assistant director
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
you okay um I'd like to move on unless
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has a burning question yeah I
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
would just like to say that I think it's
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
important that we start to educate
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves about that particular
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
process yes it certainly is would be
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
helpful um I know representative Ames
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
you had said you want to hear from Mark
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
m is that still the case that is the
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
quick hello my name is Mark manganello
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
Mark m is just fine uh I'm with the
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of school Finance uh with the
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Ames was discussing a
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
lot of the lag time with the
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
equalization process um that certainly
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
does exist as far as the ms1s coming in
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
in September which is calculating data
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
back from April and then getting
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
equalized throughout the spring and then
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
being handed off from Department of
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue to education to build budget
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
estimates in a future fiscal year so
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
when you look at that whole time span we
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
are now talking about April 22 impacting
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 so there is um certainly
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
there is is um a wide span of time in
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
that in that um data from data
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
collection to data use essentially um
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
and representative Ames brought up good
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
points about how important Equalization
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
data is so it is used in calculating
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
swept and swept is used in calculating
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy payments as far as state cash
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
that goes to school districts so uh
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
another thing just to back up a little
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
bit I know there's a lot of people on
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
this committee that are very well
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
studied in school funding but just to go
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
over the basics of adequacy real quick
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
the adequacy calculation is a state
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
determined number that is the cost of an
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
adequate education that the state has
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
determined each School District needs
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
and it's looks at student metrics um and
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
just to go real simple the base amount
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
so each student under current state law
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%
needs in fiscal year 24 needs to be
 
00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
needs in fiscal year 24 needs to be
funded

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
$4,100 um so that's base adequacy Aid um
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
there's also differential Aid components
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
wrapped into that constit tional
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
definition of adequacy that the state
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
has determined um students that are free
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
and reduced price meal eligible um
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing poverty essentially um sped
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
students Etc um but what we're doing is
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
calculating That Base Aid all those
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
differential Aid components and we're
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with the cost of inadequate
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
education so if we tally up all your
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
students and all the uh metrics we might
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
have a cost of inadequate education that
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
is a million dollar but the state does
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
not cut a check for a million doll to
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
the school district before they cut that
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
check they look at how much each
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
Community raised and swept and so if
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
your swept was swept was $500,000 and
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of inadequate education was a
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
million do the check would be
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 so it's important to know that
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
swept is determining how much the state
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
pays in cash um which is using
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
Equalization data also Equalization like
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ames pointed out is using
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant which is
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
poverty metrics over EV data um also
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
Equalization data is used in cooperative
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
apportionments for those that live in
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative apportionment some of you
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
distribute Appropriations based on EV
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
data and so the key thing is is that EV
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
data is extremely important there is a
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
lag time um so you could propose
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
changing that lag time um but I just
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
want you to understand the tradeoff of
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
of having a more quicker using more
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
current EV data so the benefit is you
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
have more current EV data and so it's
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
more responsive to changes in the data
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
which we've seen year-over-year changes
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
in EV data of 18 % since covid um which
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
is a lot it's it's pretty pretty pretty
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
wild when you look at the you know
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
50-year data set um uh the average is
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
around 7% so um in during the 2000s
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
bubble we never got up to 18% so the
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
data is really really intense right now
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
as far as growth year-over-year um but
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
if you had more current data the
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
challenge you would have the tradeoff
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
you'd be losing is less accurate budget
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
estimates coming out of the Department
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
of Education because we wouldn't be be
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
able to forecast future years with the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
swept data we already know exists we
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
would have to forecast out swept in the
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
future um it would be
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh when we set taxes or really would
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
it would it would impact the way really
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
would be impact the fiscal year 25
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
budgeting we just did so I would not be
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
able to use the swep data that I know is
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to exist so districts would build
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
their budget based on um potentially
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
unreliable swep data so that would be
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
one of the trade-offs is everyone would
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
be building their budget off basically
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
estimated EV data so if you if you bring
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
up that um if you shorten that lag
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
window that would be the trade-off you
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
would have less accurate
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
estimates no I'm I'm satisfied
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
okay represent PL I was about to say
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is fascinating and it's subject
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
material for the for the uh special
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
committee on education I'm not sure what
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
has to do with this bill right now
 
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.870 align:start position:0%
has to do with this bill right now
that's

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
all any other follow-up questions um Rob
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
zy well I thought we were using this to
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
try and discuss the whole school funding
 
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.589 align:start position:0%
try and discuss the whole school funding
problem

00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
um and in that
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
regard I would like I don't know if the
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
school funding group got this but to get
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
on these timelines from both Dr and from
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education about
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
how long it takes to do their part of
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
the process and what they're doing in
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
what you just said but on paper yeah I
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
could put that on paper yeah that's a
 
00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.470 align:start position:0%
could put that on paper yeah that's a
good

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
idea okay thank you thank you appreciate
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
um I do have a brief question for Dr
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
again about the equalization
 
00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:34.710 align:start position:0%
again about the equalization
data

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
about whether okay thank
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
Mar back when we started
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
this uh there were
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
towns that would put their property
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
assessments onto a large sheet that
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
covered several uh walls of paper and
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
make the Dr deal with that because they
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to provide it at all on I
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing has gone away by
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
now on to what extent have you been able
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
to speed up the process and
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
is well um thank you do you have proper
 
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
is well um thank you do you have proper
computerization

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I'll go out on a limb on behalf of
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal and property Division and say
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
yes we we probably have advanced into uh
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
using um software in some parts but I
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
just have to be careful because I'm not
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable enough in the area of the
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
equalization process so this is most of
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
the hangup is at the equalization
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
level I'm not certain hang up is maybe
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
an unkind word because it's
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
art as part of the process that Mark
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
just described that hopefully he'll
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:18.030 align:start position:0%
 
timeline

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh it it it takes the time it does and
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
it has uh certainly in my eight years
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
with Dr it it's been that amount of
 
00:49:28.119 --> 00:49:30.390 align:start position:0%
with Dr it it's been that amount of
time

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have any other comment on
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
the process though I'm sorry all right
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to wrap this up
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
represent fellows
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
um I mean I know I know the process for
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
doing Equalization but maybe if you
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
could just go through the steps about
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
how you equalize you know just like one
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
two three um I don't oh okay yeah I'd
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
rather not do that I think Equalization
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you yeah thank
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
um within the committee are there any uh
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
final comments before I uh end this
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
close this work
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
session representative spsb yes just
 
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.630 align:start position:0%
session representative spsb yes just
very

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
briefly if I didn't think that there was
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
a sincere effort of foot to reform this
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
whole concept of SWAT I would be urging
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
us to move ahead and vote OTP on 1514
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
right now but because I do believe that
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the direction where way
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
and means and education are going to
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
have to direct grapple with this I think
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's a bit unfair to throw this out at
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
the donor Towns at this moment as an
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
interim fragment so I'm just saying this
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
to say I am not pushing to move this
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
ahead now because I have the faith that
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
this committee really will dig into it
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
in the fall and next spring
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ames and I find
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
myself in the position of concurring
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
again with representative spillsbury I
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
agree with that sentiment and uh and
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
think that 1514 has a lot of Merit but
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think it needs to be merged into
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
this other stream of of bills and a
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
serious serious consideration needs to
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
proceed um hopefully with something like
 
00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:23.559 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee structure that was
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
developed uh uh not too too long ago for
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
some of the bills in
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
education um so yeah thank you
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I'm going to close
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
hb514 okay we'll now open the work
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
1563 representative plat I always stick
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
my neck out I I put this in the same
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
ball of wax as the previous bill that
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's got to do with swept the reluctant
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
to change much of anything till the
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
education special committee on education
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
directly representative
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
fellows um so I'm I'm the SP sponsor of
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
this bill and it's really very different
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
from the one that we just heard one of
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
the things this this um bill which is
 
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.870 align:start position:0%
the things this this um bill which is
156

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
156
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
63 um has no fiscal impact on the
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
state it um
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
addresses the Rand Court ruling that
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.789 align:start position:0%
we've heard
because

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
um the the ruling says to the extent
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
that you want to use a Statewide
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
property tax uh it you have to figure
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
out what to do with that excess payment
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
but uh what what this bill does is it
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
eliminates the swept tax from the tax
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
bills but it
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
keeps um what I call a local
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
contribution within the the aid
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
calculation formula so one thing this
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
bill could do is get the um Rand case
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
out of the way and
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
also um narrow the discussion so that we
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
won't be talking about what to do with
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
excess swept money anymore and it might
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
move the process um along a little bit
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
smoother when we're working on how to
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
fund education I do have um I did have
 
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.309 align:start position:0%
fund education I do have um I did have
an

00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
amendment for this bill that address
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
that I I have an amendment and I passed
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
it out last week that addresses all of
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns that Dr had um in terms of
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the process and it also makes a change
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
so that instead of calling it
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
local uh tax contribution it just calls
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
it a local contribution and I think that
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
that will fit really
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
well um into the discussion that that
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
will go on about how what to do with the
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid formula so one
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
consideration is um for sure we don't
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of this bill um but
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
would it be useful to go forward with
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
that now because it takes care of uh the
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
Rand issue and um it may be and I I
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it hinders I think it may
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
names um first first I I said something
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
earlier on when we were doing 1514 and I
 
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
was really thinking about 1563 and I
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
apologize the the bill that I think is
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh is novel and brings in a new idea
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's important um is
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
1563 and it uh um I've gone back and
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
forth in my own mind as to whether we
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
should push for early enactment of it it
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
would in it would as representative uh
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
fellas has said uh get the swept the
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
donor Town issue out of the way because
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any swept um and uh
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
however I also uh feel that the larger
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
issue needs to be part of the pitch when
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
addressing a sliver of the issue as does
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
1563 and so my feeling at this juncture
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
is that this bill too should go into
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
interim study with the other bill um and
 
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.430 align:start position:0%
interim study with the other bill um and
um

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
and be considered in conjunction with
 
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
the bill over an education the
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity bill which does
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
have the local contribution con have
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
embedded in it um it also continues
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
swept so unlike this bill but all of
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
that needs to be looked at as a whole as
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
we try to find a solution and to go down
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
one route uh that uh May foreclose other
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
options uh doesn't seem to me the best
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
practice given given the uh difficulty
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
of this issue thank you representative
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman again I
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
concur with the suggestion about putting
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
this into interim study I would like to
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
point out one thing that uh I learned
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
about when I served on a school board in
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
another state some years ago and that is
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
that if we look at the average annual
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
cost for
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
education and the taxes that each of us
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
may pay and I'm going to just point out
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
I have one daughter who's now
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
35 when her father and I
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
divorced each of us stayed in the
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
community where we were living and
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
between us the taxes that we paid for
 
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.950 align:start position:0%
between us the taxes that we paid for
her

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
education or that we paid on our two
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
houses barely covered the cost of her
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
education which was a regular education
 
00:57:46.109 --> 00:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
no special needs no uh lunch or
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
breakfast support and that meant there
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
was nothing left over for paying to pay
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
for the other services that the
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
community provid Ed I did a a very quick
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
um calculation here actually my phone it
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh the average per pupil cost last year
 
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.309 align:start position:0%
uh the average per pupil cost last year
was

00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:07.319 --> 00:58:09.270 align:start position:0%
was
$118,400

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
$118,400
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
if we multiply it by 12 years let's
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
assume kindergarten is not involved then
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that amount times 12 years means that a
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
child's Base education went
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
for1 100
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
91,000 if we add the cost of
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
kindergarten it means over
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
$200,000 I don't think any one of us has
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
paid that much for our own child's
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
education the folks who may move to
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
communities and I know it happens here
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
it happens in other states where people
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
move to schools to school districts
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
where the education is good and they
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
stay as long as their children are in
 
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.349 align:start position:0%
stay as long as their children are in
school

00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
and once their children are done with
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
school they move somewhere else where
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
they believe that they will not have to
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
keep continue paying for education
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
because in their minds their
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility is done it's not done if
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
we assume that the cost of Education
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
here is somewhere around
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
$200,000 then if we're paying $10,000
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm using that as a round number for
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes in a year it's going to
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
take a lot of years to pay for a child
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be educated so the communities where
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
folks may have gone to
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
retire because they are done paying for
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
education and they don't want the
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility of paying for other
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
children's education need to remember
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
that other people paid for our children
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
to get educated thank
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.630 align:start position:0%

representative yes I just want to make
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
sure I I got an email last week from
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative Muse about amendment I
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was circulated around
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
to the committee or or we had the
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
H when we asked last week the author
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
said that this amendment was the
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay what do we think what do we think
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
about this amendment represent roachford
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
did you have comments on it yes I I
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I like the concept of this um you know
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
considering if you were in a community
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
who uh you know suffered a loss or a a
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
catastrophe a catastrophic pollution
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
event and uh the state takes up a case
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
to mitigate that I was just surprised
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
that um you know as it stands now unless
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's already predetermined by the
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
legislature those funds go into the
 
01:02:04.589 --> 01:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
general fund and the people that are
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
affected by that may be having to share
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
that those funds with other needs that
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
are completely unrelated uh um to to
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
their event so I I uh I like the concept
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
of this um you know he he's you know the
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
the fund was set up for a you know to
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
kind of hold the money until the state
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
determines for two years I don't
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily if that's long enough um
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
just knowing how things move down here
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm generally supportive of of
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
this concept and it appears there's no
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
negative um to this on on the state
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
general fund right it's potentially a
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
positive represent
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:03:02.269 align:start position:0%
 
before

01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
all right I'll I'll give everybody two
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
this 702 H
 
01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:49.069 align:start position:0%
this 702 H
whoops

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:50.029 align:start position:0%
 
some

01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
aims well I I could uh point out the
 
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
aims well I I could uh point out the
change

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I think they make sense um the first
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
change is on the first page um lines 12
 
01:04:05.799 --> 01:04:06.990 align:start position:0%
change is on the first page um lines 12
to

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
14 and that's an added added uh language
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
all monies in the fund shall be non-aps
 
01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
and continually appropriated by the
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services for
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this chapter and then if
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
you go to the bottom of the same
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
page the uh sentence that begins at line
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
30 however if the commissioner of the
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
finds that the specific type of
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
contamination addressed in the
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
settlement has already been remediated
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
and no longer presents a hazard to the
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
environment or the health of the public
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
the commissioner May request the state
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer to transfer the settlement to
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
one or more dedicated environmental
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
funds under the administration of the
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
remember we discussed that issue so this
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
provides flexib
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
ability uh that's the intent there uh
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
with controls and then the last uh
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
change um
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
is uh in paragraph
 
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.349 align:start position:0%
is uh in paragraph
4

01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
4
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
um and I think wait a
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
minute yeah it's uh it's a slight change
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
right the state treasurer
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
um it yeah this is a little harder to to
 
01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:39.589 align:start position:0%
um it yeah this is a little harder to to
explain

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe maybe representative
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
Army will haard well from what I'm from
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing representative Ames it
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
looks like instead of transferring it
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
directly the IM it says to the immediate
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
use of the solid waste management fund
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
own drinking water fund now it is
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
um uh environmental funds under the
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
administration of the Department of
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as directed by
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
the commission so it gives it gives more
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility yeah I think that's
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
right okay any other comments it seems
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
like the amendment uh has addressed the
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
concerns of the previous bill
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
okay um seeing no more comments I'm
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
1613 I'll now open the work session on
 
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
1613 I'll now open the work session on
HB

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
1655 that's relative to establishing an
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
educator certification fund for fees
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
paid to the Department of
 
01:06:53.079 --> 01:07:04.069 align:start position:0%
paid to the Department of
Education

01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
comment representative fellows
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
um I forgot to go upstairs and pick up
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I had done for this
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's already printed and it's upstairs
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment um takes out the second
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill so that the only thing that it does
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
is um it
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
just the criminal history check stays
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just what's on line five and
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
six it has that change but the rest of
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
it uh goes away so there's no it's not
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
creating any kind of new fund um
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative alme and I sat down with
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
the drafter one of the things that we
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
found is we already knew that in two
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
different places in the um dedicated
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
funds report the name was of the fund
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
was different and we actually found a
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
third name for the fund so there really
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
we we could not try to um do this second
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
part because we we couldn't we didn't
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
even know what name to put in for the
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund was the the biggest issue but the
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is fine I just forgot to bring
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
it downstairs okay so we can get it uh
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
for the exec session representative elme
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
yes um we haven't been able to talk
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
about this but I spent
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
time following up on the second
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph um after I discovered that the
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
um Department really wanted this uh it
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
turns out that
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
the uh Das the administrative Services
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
is challenging probably the com
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
controller CH challenging
 
01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:56.430 align:start position:0%
controller CH challenging
on

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is not continual
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation the department has been
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
the department and some of a lot of the
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
department language dates back a
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
century and it's it's uh never
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
apparently been cleaned up um which is
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
why they're I think four names for this
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
Fund in different places and there's
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
also a missing uh link from the
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
612 um that is it sends it to somewhere
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
else um
 
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.510 align:start position:0%
else um
and

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
on I talked with alak conus the head of
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
um Drafting and Research
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
Services and and I talked to the LBA to
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
Mickey and who's in charge of the
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
education stuff they agreed it's all a
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
mess uh but they also
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um they also realized that there is an
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
issue there
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
that the Lang existing language says the
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
fund is non-aps in an kind of elderly
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
way and it doesn't say anything about
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
continually appropriating which means
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
that if you're in the middle of a
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
project and July 1 shows
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
up and they haven't put that specific
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
item in the budget you can't finish the
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
project um and that
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
on I'm not sure that
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's been a problem yet where they
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
were denied the ability to do that but
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
um I've got Mickey from
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
lbo and
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
alakus working
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
on how can we make this
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
work because if we this
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
language here is not
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the
 
01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.470 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the
first

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
language on for some bureaucratic reason
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't quite understand um but it
 
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
can't be added onto there without um
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
fixing a few other
 
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.110 align:start position:0%
fixing a few other
things

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.950 align:start position:0%
things
and

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh if we can I can't remember whether
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
this one has to be it doesn't have to be
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
done until the 21st at any rate if we
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
could put it off until we see if we can
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
solve that second problem that they've
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
got uh that they they are they did start
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
okay represent fellows so um can you
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
explain what you mean what what it is
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
that you think that we could
 
01:12:07.719 --> 01:12:09.590 align:start position:0%
that you think that we could
be

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
doing the I believe it's the comproller
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
but d
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
d is Raising questions and telling them
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't be able to
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
line and what what lbo has been sticking
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
into the budget isn't sufficient to
 
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:42.030 align:start position:0%
into the budget isn't sufficient to
allow

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that representative uh
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
fellows so my understanding when I talk
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
to um um LBA I I asked them like what
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
does it mean what what is the
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
significance of having a fund that's
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated and they and
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
they when it's when it's already non-aps
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the explanation that I got was that
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
um if it's not continually appropriated
 
01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
it gets a little more um scrutiny in the
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
budget process because the department
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
will have to you know um suggest just
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
Appropriations when they build build the
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
budget so I and it's been like that for
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
decades so I'm thinking that
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's O Okay the way it
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
is I mean if let me just interject if we
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
didn't if this and I'm not suggesting
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
this be the case but if this bill was
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
itl wouldn't you still have the same
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
concern because the only thing that's
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
changed here is the yes you would still
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
have the same concern
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
yes and it's one that apparently has
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
been raised but I it must be the
 
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.149 align:start position:0%
been raised but I it must be the
comproller

01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
comproller
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's Das they said Das has has
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
um the the way to fix
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
it without fixing this is that education
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
has to remember for every one of their
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
of their um items like this
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
to put different language into the
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
budget the department on lbo has been
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
fig realized there was a problem decades
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
ago apparently and has been putting
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
language into the budget which doesn't
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
please the comproller
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
so given that it's been decades then
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's sounds like our what is the
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
immediacy not that not that it shouldn't
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
be solved but what is the immediacy to
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
solve it right now I mean it sounds like
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
rather than rushing that solution which
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
sounds a
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
little complex given that it's extremely
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
complex so I my my feeling is it's the
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that getting solved in the
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
next week is Slim and I'd probably
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
rather see this not be rushed and come
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
up with a new solution next year yeah
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
well I I don't think they're rushing it
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
but representative fellows oh so so I I
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that to you know the the
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
issue with the comp troller take care of
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
that next year or maybe the department
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
and L LBA can work it out but we do want
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
to pass the top part of it because last
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
year I think it was I'm pretty sure it
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
was last year a bill passed that said
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
the dep Department of Education should
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
do criminal background checks on new te
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
teachers or maybe when they renew I'm
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
not sure and people have been asking for
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
that for ages this the top part of this
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
gives them the rule making Authority on
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
how to go about doing that so we don't
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
want to just kill the whole bill I and I
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
agree with that my example was only to
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
make a point but I agree with that okay
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
represent Ames your microphone's been on
 
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
do you have a no okay yeah all right
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to say that their
 
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
solution seems to be that we're going to
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
solve this in the dedicated fund
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee I have started looking at the
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
education statutes and I
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
on legislative budget
 
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
on legislative budget
office

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
and and alakus all agreed that it is a
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
total an utter
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
mess and that there's it there's um um
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be done by our small
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee we're they're trying to figure
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
out who's the best what's the best way
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
to get this
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you I'm going to close
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
1655 okay we're now on to our final work
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
session of the morning which is hp61 I
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
1611

01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
1611
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
oh all right I'm going to start with
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative ases and then
 
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.149 align:start position:0%
representative ases and then
representative

01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
plet okay
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I just would start by pointing
 
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
out that there's no appropriation
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Association with this it's setting up a
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh which um the sponsors who
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
develop this think is important and that
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
would be available to um receive funds
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
and set a framework for using them um
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
that might flow out of next year's
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
budget for example um so it's sort of
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
getting ready and um if uh if there's
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
some particular feature of this that
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh needs to be adjusted when money
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
comes into sight I imagine the adjusting
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
will be done but this uh I think is
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
enabling conversations to go forward and
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
solutions to be put on the table and uh
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
so I I would support it as is um and uh
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
note that a special committee that was
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
established to work on these issues uh
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
that worked in a bipartisan way on this
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill has uh has recommended this uh and
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
it has passed through the house is this
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
one that's passed through the house yes
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
it is um is the second committee bill
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
has uh on a policy basis said yeah do it
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
and um I think we should do
 
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.790 align:start position:0%
and um I think we should do
it

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
ditto uh representative
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
roord yes thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh agree with with everything uh
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative am says I I I you know we
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
the policy committee came up with this I
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
know there was some questions around the
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
hearing about the broadness and maybe
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
open-endedness of it and I was reminded
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
that the policy committee actually has
 
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
heard this and um the special policy
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee on this and uh and they were
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that put it to us in this
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
format so so I would support this as
 
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:59.310 align:start position:0%
format so so I would support this as
well

01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith I also wanted
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
to reiterate the support that we've
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
heard for it I think this is a good bill
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
and going in the right direction I did
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
also want to mention for the note that
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
my wife is a child care U professional
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
herself so she may potentially benefit
 
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
from this but I wanted to be open about
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
well any other comments
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm swimming the other
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
direction uh I found I find this build
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of bizarre uh it doesn't have
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
any caps it doesn't indicate any
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
criteria it's got a wide open range of
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh different kinds of things that uh uh
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
money could be granted for that are
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
essentially like the kinds of benefits a
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
major corporate employer would offer to
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and so this is going
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
to be done through grants from the state
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I have reservations about the
 
01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
and uh I have reservations about the
whole

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
concept representative elberger thank
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman may I ask for uh Jackie
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
Cowell to come back up to the table she
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
you the list of please uh wait a minute
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself please how do you do
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm Jackie Cowell from Early Learning
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a private Statewide
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit thank you thank you for coming
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
back and answering some questions there
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
is a list of eight items for which
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
funding might be provided and I believe
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned that all of those
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
items were taken from bills that had
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
passed in other states that's correct
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
senator representative elberg um elberg
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
we um we did find that um we went to
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
other states but also here in New
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of those allowable uses
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
many of them were in the actual dhh
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
state plan of allowable uses for Child
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals and again the reason
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
for asking for this is the only other
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
way to raise the earnings of the and to
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
retain and recruit the Child Care
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
Professionals is to ask the parents the
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
hardworking families that are using it
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
now to to cover that burden and they
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
can't so yes other States including New
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have used federal funds state
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
funds uh private funds for these
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
uses may I thank you and is there
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
documentation for how these funds get
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
used you don't just give people money
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
and say have a good time with it correct
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that's really what we're
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
thinking you know the thoughtful process
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
that DHHS will undertake during the
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
rules making process of figuring that
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
out yes that will all be very thoughtful
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
and not just a handout yeah thank you um
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
given that I hope that some
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury's concerns
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
about lack of accountability might be
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows well let let
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
me go to okay representative fellows
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
followed by representative shamard yeah
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
so I could could I ask can't remember
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
her name yeah so do do you remember
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
why uh this was amended by it it tells
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
me in the F the house special committee
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
on child care why it was amended
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
to initially it said that that HHS would
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
would administer this program but it was
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
changed to to say that a designated
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
entity yes and and so DHHS has there's a
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
lot of um work on their plate around
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
family affordability a lot of policies
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
that changed last year and they've been
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
doing grants throughout the pandemic as
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
extra um effort on their plate and so it
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
really is something my I know um Karen
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
he Hebert is here from DHHS but it's
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
both the prime sponsor's understanding
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
as well as mine that um that would be
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
the U most thoughtful way and the best
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
and most and easiest way to get the
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
money out the door in a timely manner to
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
the programs um and also the employers
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
the childcare employers and there's a
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
part in there too around um that there
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
would be Child Care employees this was
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
amended as representative disimon knows
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
this was repres this was amended by the
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
house special committee on child care to
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
also add that individuals could apply um
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
for this and um it is intended again as
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
it is being formed and and built and
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
established that that those individuals
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes good morning my name is Karen Hebert
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
I'm the director for the division of
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
economic stability at DHHS happy to
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question so so my concern
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
when I see on line 11 that um an entity
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
the department is going to identify an
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
entity to administer the program I'm
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
just concerned about some grants
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
particularly like federal grants that
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
give you an admin you know 10% or what
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that this would create a
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem with that if the agency wasn't
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
managing it do you can you address that
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
I absolutely can thank you for the
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
question uh so we've actually attempted
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
this both ways uh in the last few years
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and one of those ways we have currently
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
functioning right now with a third-party
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
entity relates to federal funds uh and
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
it actually has been a very smooth
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
process um certainly one that uh could
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
arguably arguably be also less expensive
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
to have a third- party administer grants
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
like this for us the volume that we
 
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
would anticipate for applications for
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
these grants uh I would expect to be
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
pretty significant uh and especially
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time so I believe
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
that having it administered by a third
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
favored follow so you have no concern
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
that um Federal money that might be used
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
for this would not be allowed because of
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that language is that correct correct
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you R
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman uh just a
 
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
supplemental piece of information
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
concerning you know the lines 19 through
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
30 on this bill uh back in the fall
 
01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.750 align:start position:0%
30 on this bill uh back in the fall
Governor

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
sonunu uh expressed his concern about
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
child care by uh the the industry of
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
Child Care by recommending a uh $15
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
million one-time
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
distribution and it covered professional
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
development incentives tuition
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
assistance student loan repayment and
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
other uh approved purposes and I think
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
that his leadership is showing that we
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
do need to do something this is an
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
economic issue for this state when work
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
Working Families cannot find uh uh child
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
care and quality child care they can't
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
go to work uh most of our Working
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
Families are two
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
parents a lot of our Working Families
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
Are One parent and our employers are
 
01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.629 align:start position:0%
Are One parent and our employers are
looking

01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
for looking for people to work so this I
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
believe is a necessary fund so that we
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
can when money becomes available from
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
whatever Source it will be ready to be
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
used and I think that Governor sonunu
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
when he talked about the definitions of
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
how it to be used I think gives us a
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
good direction that we should go as a
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative Aly thank you
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to get back to lines
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
on 12-
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
14 it does say that if the employer
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
fails to apply within three months after
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
an employee has come to them and asked
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
for them to help on that the employee
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
can apply directly to your
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
department on so the The Entity wouldn't
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
be involved at that point it looks like
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
but you just said the entity would be
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
involved and that is the intent to
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
include any employees that would
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately be interested in applying to
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
apply Direct with the uh third party
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
entity that would administer the grant
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
so that is that is an area we will add
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
Ames I think you are going to say that
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
the department is comfortable that that
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
this section can be administered by The
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
Entity and that the awards
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
um would be on behalf of the department
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
so this language is sufficient as I read
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
it to cover the situation that
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is concerned
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
about but it says the employee shall be
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply directly to the
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
department for grant
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
funding it does
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm not concerned about that I
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
believe the department has the
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
discretion to set up a a process
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
for responding to that application and
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
can use this entity for that purpose
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
understanding do you have I should
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
quickly add do you have any concerns
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
about this have you thought about this
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
issue I I have uh thank you for the
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
question I have certainly considered
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
that and I think you could go either way
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
if the department is
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh overseeing the fund and and the grant
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
distribution itself uh we certainly are
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
within our means to contract with a
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
third- party vendor um so long as there
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
is an appropriation to do
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
so for both whether it's the provider or
 
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
so for both whether it's the provider or
the

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
employee to repres to representative
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
aly's Point couldn't that line lead
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
to just a barrage of applications to
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS because there's a lot of small
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
employers who aren't going to be able to
 
01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
employers who aren't going to be able to
handle

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
this yes and I I would expect and be
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
that and would you need extra funding
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
extra employees to handle that we
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
usually estimate that if we are to use a
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
third-party uh vendor to administer or
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
conduct any business on behalf of the
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
department we typically uh estimate
 
01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:01.719 align:start position:0%
about 10% of any particular um fund or
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
benefit that is being distributed that
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
the 10% of that fund would essentially
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
cover the administrative costs for that
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
vendor to administer the
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
fund representative PL just want to make
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
taxes representative
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
ducet couple quick
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
questions do you know what the deficit
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
or have a rough idea of the deficit of
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
child care providers there are now I
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
know it's not relative to what we're
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
talking about right
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
now if if You' to venture
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
a guess because it's in your per so uh
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
the department tracks uh through the
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing unit the number of
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
licensed providers in the state which I
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
think is uh more or less of 700 uh which
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
has been a pretty steady number for the
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
last uh couple of years um you know I'm
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
also aware that we're not able to track
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
the number of unlicensed or rather
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
licensed exempt programs uh in the State
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh so that is an unknown number and
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether that has been increasing or
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
decreasing I'm sorry I'm not able to
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
report and do you know if if I'm sorry
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
would would you know if this legislation
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
would apply to those
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
non-licensed employees it's my
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
understanding uh that it it does so long
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
as the
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
employer is registered with the state as
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
a licensed exempt program to accept
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
Child Care scholarship children so
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
families that are receiving the child
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
care scholarship which is uh a subsidy
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
for child care in New Hampshire so
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
licensed exempt providers would have to
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
register with the state to receive
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
funding to support those families so if
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
they are they would qualify for this
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
fund follow up okay and and tertiary to
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
this question because uh miss your your
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
specialty is in DHHS could you speak to
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of deficiencies we have say in
 
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.350 align:start position:0%
what kind of deficiencies we have say in
health

01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
care providers if you want a a specific
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
RN or CNAs what what kind of I know that
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have a problem with with uh with uh
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
child child care providers what kind
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
of deficiencies we have in that and and
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked this question is that
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
this addresses a very specific
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce this cracks the seal in
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a fund that the people in
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be taxed on to
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
provide benefits and wages to a very
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
specific Workforce we have deficiencies
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
across every
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
field and it's my belief that government
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily the answer to
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
every Workforce
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
problem and I I just wonder if this is
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
this a part of the solution for child
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
care providers if it's not part of the
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
solution for health care
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
providers or ice cream vendor providers
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm being abstract in that
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering we have a
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
deficiency and I know we have a
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
deficiency in healthc care providers we
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
deficiency public service with
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters paramedics police officers
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
correctional officers we all know about
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
that so my concern here for this
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm sorry I'm going on
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
about this but my concern here is is
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
cracking that
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
seal and giving a mandate and
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a fund that we don't know
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
what the dollars are you're correct
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative PL there is no tax
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars here
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
yet so I have great issue with
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
this thank thank
 
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.149 align:start position:0%
this thank thank
you

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
ER representa Al represent Aly and then
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative ER okay
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
on I'm sorry I didn't bring uh the
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
document with me that I've been reading
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
over the weekend which said that there
 
01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.430 align:start position:0%
over the weekend which said that there
are

01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.270 align:start position:0%
are
uh

01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
about over somewhere between 1 and 2,000
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the child care Workforce
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
with those
 
01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.870 align:start position:0%
with those
700

01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
700
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh licensed
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
providers and that because of that the
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
rooms are not used because they don't
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
have the staff to use them um it is very
 
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.229 align:start position:0%
have the staff to use them um it is very
obvious

01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
that this was a problem before the
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic but it became a lot more of a
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
problem since the pandemic
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
because as in the medical field a bunch
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
of people got overwhelmed and
 
01:37:31.159 --> 01:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
of people got overwhelmed and
left

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
left
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh but it is also obvious that if you do
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
not have child care your twers per
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
family economy turns into a 1 point
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
something person economy and we don't
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
have enough work
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce for our state to prosper
 
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.390 align:start position:0%
Workforce for our state to prosper
and

01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
specifically uh money to come in that we
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
can tax without raising the tax on
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
everybody so
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
um this is much more
 
01:38:13.119 --> 01:38:14.990 align:start position:0%
um this is much more
directly

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh affecting the
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
workforce then uh
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
the large amount of work that would have
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be done on the medical Workforce to
 
01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.310 align:start position:0%
to be done on the medical Workforce to
to

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
um keep people able to come
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
in and I think that's why it's um been
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of attention from the Bia
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
from the Governor from the the um
 
01:38:50.199 --> 01:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
from the Governor from the the um
economists

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
economists
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
in recent years they've woken up and
 
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.189 align:start position:0%
in recent years they've woken up and
realized

01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
realized
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
that especially women can't be doing two
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs at the same
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
ER thank you Mr chair I'm having a hard
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
time with this particular Bill and and
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
the wording that's contained there in
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
where this state is going to set up a
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's going but that fund is not going to
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
be administered by the state it's going
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
to be administered by a third party
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the distribution or who
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies for the distribution of
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
funds without a set of guidelines
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
contained in the law as to what the
 
01:39:41.119 --> 01:39:43.910 align:start position:0%
contained in the law as to what the
requirements

01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
are other than they're going to be given
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
to somebody for something that deals
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
and as was stated by uh representative
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
walner when she sat there eventually
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
funded well she
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
did when she was asked that
 
01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:16.030 align:start position:0%
did when she was asked that
question

01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
so where are the guidelines where the
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
where where are the constrictions where
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
perimeter other than we'll make it up in
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
along did you have a answer for that
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
sure I was certainly going to make
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
reference to the ru making as well as
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
some of the guidelines that we have been
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
in um applying with past grant
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh or current grant
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we have now
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so I uh uh the department would be
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing the fund and the
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
administration of it but we may
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
certainly or if it is legislated uh we
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
if not legislated we certainly choose to
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
consider uh making use of a thirdparty
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
vendor to assist us to administer that
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
fund um so the department would still be
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
overseeing that fund and establishing
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
the guard rails or guidelines with
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the criteria and the
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
yes the guidelines are set up by law not
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
agency and they're not
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
there as far as I can see I see them
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
being created in
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
rules but
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
as well we've had this discussion in
 
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
this committee repeatedly rules don't
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily work as well as
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
statute regarding distribution of
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
funds uh I
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
think one other program favored by both
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
has been criticized as lacking
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
issue just based on the experience that
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
we have had over the last 2 three years
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to grant
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh both federal and state
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
fund Ed um I don't see that as a concern
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department's perspective um but
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
I certainly
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate um uh what you are describing
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
and the concerns that you have with
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
you president
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
Ley thank you Mr
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
chair um so I just feel the need to
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
respond um to to comments first of all
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
that um often in this committee we are
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
told not to debate the policy that
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's not our role um so it seems that
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
we've turned to debating the policy and
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
I'd just like for us to pause for a
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
minute and consider the kinds of
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
comments that we're making
 
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
um we do fund the
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
police the taxpayers fund the police I
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that we're opposing to that
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not in favor of defunding
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
the police
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we fund teachers also I think these
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
are the the basic uh building stones of
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
civilization and as a mother who just
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
lived through a pandemic where I lost
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
the ability to send my children to
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
school um and I'm an educator so you
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
know I had the the background apparently
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
to educate my children at home but
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
discovered that that was very difficult
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
so yes the state has a role to play in
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
our society as it works right now so the
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
question we're asking right now is
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
should the state participate at all even
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
might we help facilitate the
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
dispersement of funds to child care
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
providers and the rules are quite clear
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
in this bill the expenses must have
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
already been incurred right and there's
 
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
a a list of eight things that those
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
expenses must have been spent for in
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
order to get reimbursed from this fund
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a very um humble request
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we support something very basic
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the state keeps asking
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
where are the workers where are the
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
workers right and we've pinpointed two
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
pretty big problems that we're having in
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing and child care
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
workers must be able to access these
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
things in order to go to work I think
 
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
that the policy's already been discussed
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
in fact it's been discussed by a
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee that was specially designed to
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
deal with the child care problem so for
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
us to to devolve into debating policy on

with I just want to point out that
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing if we choose to
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
do that we we may as a committee but but
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
let's be conscious of where this
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
conversation has gone I think the the
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
policy has been uh debated already and I
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.870 align:start position:0%

comments my concern here
 
01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:15.990 align:start position:0%
comments my concern here
is

01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:18.270 --> 01:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal this is going to create a
 
01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.470 align:start position:0%
fiscal this is going to create a
dedicated

01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
fund of that fund at some point it will
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
be supported by taxpayer dollars and
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard testimony that over 10%
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
because 10% is going to go to the
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
administration by an outside vendor of
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
those funds to administer this specific
 
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.109 align:start position:0%
those funds to administer this specific
fund

01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
um it's going to you know depend whether
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
that's $1 or a million dollars 10% of
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to administer that for a
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
very specific Workforce what I see here
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
is next bium next year the next
 
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce coming up wanting to establish
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund so they can get
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
supported by tax dollars for employee
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
stop thank
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
you I'll take one
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
more uh one more comment representa
 
01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.510 align:start position:0%
more uh one more comment representa
um

01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I was also making a very
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
important fiscal
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
point if we do not
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
have the caretaker for the children
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
working in the family
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
working we are reducing our
 
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce to what it was less than we
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
had before the
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic on and we are in reducing our
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce as the
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
Bia also considers that's why they're
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
behind this and we are making it harder
 
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
for businesses to thrive to produce and
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
to to create Revenue that we do
 
01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.229 align:start position:0%
to to create Revenue that we do
tax

01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:48:21.239 --> 01:48:23.070 align:start position:0%
tax
and

01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
on and our whole economy to thrive we
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
have not been paying attention to this
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
in the past because on it's mostly women
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
and women were trying to do two jobs at
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
time on the pandemic taught a hell of a
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
lot of people younger than me
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I think
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Aly we're getting to
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative lepley's point we don't
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
want to discuss the policy um the the
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
the main point here is what is it going
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
to cost the state and I think we've
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
we've cost the state and what is it
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
going to gain the state okay the fiscal
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
component I'm going to um close the work
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
1611 okay now um obviously we are a
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
little behind on the exec session um but
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
I do want to get the exec sessions uh
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
done before we go to lunch because at
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
1:00 we have public hearings and I want
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
to keep those um on schedule as best we
 
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
to keep those um on schedule as best we
can

01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
1122 I want to firmly come back at 11:35
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going allow time for
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%

these bills
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we were unable to get a
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
substitute for
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%

pass on 1655 and I'd like to introduce
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
an amendment well hold on a second do I
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Bolton
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.519 --> 02:19:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
20241

02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
17h do I have a second on the
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
amendment second by represent elberger
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
oh it really screws me up when you have
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
a different second from the main motion
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
to the these papers aren't do we have
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
any objection having representative
 
02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:36.990 align:start position:0%
any objection having representative
Bolton

02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
Bolton
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
second they do it we'll have to we'll
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
have to kind of figure out why those um
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
because he tells me to do it in one line
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
and it's impossible when you have when
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you have two different motions in
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
seconds there's got to be a well we'll
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to look into that there's got to be
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
a way around that yeah two
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
lines all right would you like to speak
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
to your Amendment uh yes so the
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
amendment deletes the part that has to
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
do with new language
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
nonlinguistic

02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
nonlinguistic
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
statute already has language that makes
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
it a non-aps fund and um representative
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
alme and I um concluded that it it's
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
factors that um are preventing us from
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's not straightforward how to um
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
address the the notion of making the
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
fund non-lps in continuing continually
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated at this time because of

motion yes thank you Mr
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think that we understand
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem with the child
 
02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:51.630 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem with the child
care

02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce I think we understand that uh
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has uh laid out a
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
broad suggestion here and uh and the
 
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
house has acted on it sent it to
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
us but as I look through this bill as
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's written I see no
 
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation I see an indeterminable
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact I see another non-aps fund
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
I find no figures no
 
02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
caps I find no qualifying criteria but
 
02:25:26.349 --> 02:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
rather open mind open ended rulle making
 
02:25:29.550 --> 02:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
Authority and that's a very very broad
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh grant for us to make of State
 
02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.150 align:start position:0%
uh grant for us to make of State
taxpayers

02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
money and then to be uh managed in ways
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
that we're not entirely sure of with the
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
designated entity that leaves too many
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
issues it's not a budget year this is a
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
bill that could be Rewritten and give
 
02:25:49.710 --> 02:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
given much more meat on the bones for
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%

retain a more educated professional
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
Child Care employee which will then
 
02:27:14.110 --> 02:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
assist our community Employers in
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%

kids can find more reliable child care
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%

creating this fund will allow for
 
02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
options that the state can use to help
 
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
decrease barriers to access child care
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Aly thank you
 
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
on the reason for putting this bill in
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
this year was so that there would be a
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
framework for which HHS would write
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
rules which would then
 
02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:04.830 align:start position:0%
rules which would then
allow

02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
the the funding of it next year with it
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
fra with a framework with guidelines
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
with all the things that you're missing
 
02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:18.429 align:start position:0%
with all the things that you're missing
um

02:28:18.429 --> 02:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
they can the agency that is supposed to
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
be that is doing this is learning by
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
doing this year they have 15 million
 
02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
they are they asked for uh applications
 
02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
they have they are looking at the
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
applications they will be making grants
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
this year uh so hopefully they will do a
 
02:28:43.950 --> 02:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
good job of writing the
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
rules um without the stimulus
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
of of this bill they probably will not
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
be writing the rules we heard from
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
someone from HHS the other day who said
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
if there's money and then someone else
 
02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
said we just have to find the money
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
inside the
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
department to write the rules because
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
there's no money in this there's no
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
money in this but this does have a
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
substantial effect on our economy and
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
therefore on our
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
revenues uh in the
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
future and on there is ample evidence
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
that this is needed in order to expand
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
our Workforce back to where it was
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
before the
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic um relative to our population
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
that is is
 
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.230 align:start position:0%
that is is
um

02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
and I hope
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
that that we will be able to defeat this
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
itl and go ahead and do what the revenue
 
02:30:06.429 --> 02:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to do and vote for
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill so that next year on which is
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
a budget year things can go forward more
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
Rochford thank you Mr
 
02:30:25.150 --> 02:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
chairman I think um I made it clear
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
previously what I feel about the policy
 
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh on this bill um a wise colleague of
 
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
mine recently said we shouldn't let
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
perfect get in the way of good although
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
the policy is isn't perfect it's good um
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
but looking at the need of the why we
 
02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
need the policy there's a crisis in
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
health in in child care and it it
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's hiring maintaining
 
02:30:53.550 --> 02:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
facilities getting
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
registered a lot of that's
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted by us we've imposed rules
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
and regulations and and
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
requirements upon this this group of
 
02:31:08.190 --> 02:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
providers in our state that almost puts
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
them at a disadvantage from day
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
one so do
 
02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
we how do we approach that do we do we
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
put a put a bandaid on it or do we tear
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
it apart and take a closer look at it
 
02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's a question for this committee
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
that this came out of the first
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee and I trust that they'll
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
continue to do
 
02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
continue to do
that

02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
um my colleagues have highlighted some
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
things about the finance part of it and
 
02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was Illustrated
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
to me is a bill that we just pass 1613
 
02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
establishing a trust fund was very clear
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
what happens to the money if it doesn't
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
get spent
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
where does it go how how long does it
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
sit there unused and these are all valid
 
02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
um fiscal concerns and uh responsible
 
02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
questions um and questions I think that
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
you know our committee that's where we
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
should be focused on and that's not the
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
policy because the policy came out of
 
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.469 align:start position:0%
the first
committee

02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
um that all said I'm going to
 
02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
reluctantly support the itl
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elberger thank
 
02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:32:25.389 --> 02:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
chairman sorry uh one of the things that
 
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in our hearing last week was
 
02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
that the concern
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
about uh accountability and no cap is a
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
situation that we have spent to date
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
about $60 million if I'm correct for
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts for which
 
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
there is is likewise not not only no cap
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
on the spending there's also no
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
accountability unlike this bill for
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
which there is accountability we know
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
where the money would
 
02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:00.990 align:start position:0%
where the money would
go

02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
um we already provide tax advantages and
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
in that way public money to businesses
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the form of writeoffs on equipment or
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
um sorry this is not my my areas area of
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
expertise but we allow T businesses to
 
02:33:27.550 --> 02:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
write off items that regular citizens
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
simply can't if I want to
 
02:33:34.990 --> 02:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
buy a copier and printer for my home
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
office I pay for it and that's it if I'm
 
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
a business and I'm using it for my
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
business I can get a write off for it we
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
are supporting businesses with our tax
 
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
dollarars and that that way we also
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
provide benefits Financial benefits
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
State money to uh retirement funds for
 
02:33:57.309 --> 02:33:57.319 align:start position:0%
police and
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
firefighters the idea of this bill uh
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
providing benefits to one particular
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
industry and who knows what kind of
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
slippery slope that's the beginning of
 
02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned about that we're
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%

03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
03:34:55.469 --> 03:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
I I'm Senator lud aladro I represent
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
District 20 b Awards 2 3 4 10 11 and 12
 
03:35:03.389 --> 03:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
and I come before you as the prime
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of Senate Bill 324 as amended in
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
Senate it's a very simple piece of
 
03:35:12.870 --> 03:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislation the bill requires that the
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission to notify licensed
 
03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
Distributors of Lucky 7 tickets when
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
their licenses expire or or is revoked
 
03:35:25.469 --> 03:35:25.479 align:start position:0%
as many of you may know there have been
 
03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
significant problems with license
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
renewals the IRS has been way way behind
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
in uh 5 uh 501c3 ruls sometimes taking a
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
year and the clubs that that that
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
distribute the Lucky Sevens or sell the
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
Lucky Sevens are basically managed by by
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
elderly groups these days uh the
 
03:35:53.550 --> 03:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
vfw's and and the clubs are usually
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
managed by older vets and as a as a
 
03:35:59.189 --> 03:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
result some of them uh have missed the
 
03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
dates when their renewal was due and as
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
a result of that have lost their ability
 
03:36:07.870 --> 03:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh to sell Lucky Seven tickets and pull
 
03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
tab tickets have been very big in the
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
fars particularly in the clubs for a
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
long long period of time and it it's a
 
03:36:16.510 --> 03:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
way that they sustain themselves in
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
terms of helping the community and
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
helping the N for-profits that they work
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
with now I worked this over with the uh
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission and they were
 
03:36:28.110 --> 03:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
very helpful a in granting extensions
 
03:36:30.750 --> 03:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
when licenses expired because of
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
problems with the IRS or other other
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
problems and uh we know that membership
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
in these organizations is declining and
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of that it's difficult to
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
get people to volunteer and so forth and
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
so it the charitable work done by these
 
03:36:50.510 --> 03:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
organizations is is uh is really
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
something that we can't
 
03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:53.990 align:start position:0%
something that we can't
lose

03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
lose
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh they do lose the ability to sell the
 
03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
lucky sevs if if U their license has
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
expired that's all this bill does is say
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
that they will be notified that their
 
03:37:08.590 --> 03:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
license has expired at the due date when
 
03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
it has to be renewed or if if the
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
license has has been uh revoked and the
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
only person that's notified is the
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
person that holds the license and indeed
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that's the full intent of
 
03:37:23.830 --> 03:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
the piece of legislation that's the body
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
of the piece of legislation and I hope
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
that you'll act favorably on it uh I
 
03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
don't think the Lottery Commission has
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
any opposition to it it's just a
 
03:37:35.070 --> 03:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
situation where they're doing their job
 
03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
and the individual clubs are doing their
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
job and we keep the thing going so with
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
that I'll answer any questions you might
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
have and I thank you very much for your
 
03:37:47.309 --> 03:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
attentiveness um so just to be clear the
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
the last part of this bill where it says
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
the commission shall notify lenses
 
03:37:54.990 --> 03:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA so forth if the
 
03:37:56.950 --> 03:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
license is revoked or suspended are they
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
not not notified now well that's been a
 
03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
problem so I want them officially
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
notified like you're not in statute
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
right okay put it in statute as it is
 
03:38:10.990 --> 03:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
for driver's license
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
registration and follows that that line
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
and the and the rationale is many of
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
many of these people are are are moving
 
03:38:21.550 --> 03:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
along in in terms of years and this is a
 
03:38:24.189 --> 03:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
good reminder it allows them to keep
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
functioning uh and as I said the the big
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
problem is really uh with the IRS and
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can't handle
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
but at least we can handle the state we
 
03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't want those licenses thrown out
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
because of a problem okay thank you
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent elme yeah uh that's
 
03:38:45.150 --> 03:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
same section on they have to
 
03:38:48.189 --> 03:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
notify at least 45 days before the
 
03:38:49.870 --> 03:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
revocation or
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
suspension what if it's done because
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
somebody ran off with the
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
till well that's a that's a good
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
question that's I I think mostly it's
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
clerks in the towns that are doing
 
03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
that at this time and the clubs are
 
03:39:09.309 --> 03:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
pretty good that the the membership is
 
03:39:09.319 --> 03:39:10.950 align:start position:0%
pretty good that the the membership is
basically

03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
veterans and guys who are close in the
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
organization so that's that could be a
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
problem uh but I don't I don't see that
 
03:39:21.790 --> 03:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
as a a real a real concern at this point
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
in time always you always have to be
 
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
concerned but they don't they don't
 
03:39:28.990 --> 03:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
generate enough money uh you know to to
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
do that but thank you for the question I
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a good one representative PL
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
I would just say I was treasurer of lion
 
03:39:38.550 --> 03:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
San hearing Foundation of New Hampshire
 
03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
Inc with over a million dollar in the
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
till I find it pretty hard to run away
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
because it's invested in
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the in the investment
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
agent would notify people and I'm bonded
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
and so any kind of sizable money they'd
 
03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:56.110 align:start position:0%
and so any kind of sizable money they'd
be

03:39:56.110 --> 03:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
bonded represent Al yes
 
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
um well we're not supposed to have this
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
this discussion now but but I doubt a
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
bonded well and it's a good point I I
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
they may or may not but I think
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking they probably out B
 
03:40:18.750 --> 03:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
and I think you're correct they
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers they they're they're retired
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
servicemen in most instances they're
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
American legiance they
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
vfw's uh it it's these posts that that I
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
want to protect uh so that they can get
 
03:40:33.070 --> 03:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
their licenses renewed in a timely
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
manner it continue to function doing
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
what they what what they do in terms of
 
03:40:41.710 --> 03:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
supporting the Charities that they do
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
if could there be a situation where
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
somebody's license needed to be uh
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
revoked immediately but now you have to
 
03:40:51.630 --> 03:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
give them 45 days notice or is
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
that I I it's a good question I think if
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
it needed to be re revoked immediately
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission uh would would
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
address that as they as they did in the
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
particular situation that we all are
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
aware of okay representative fellows um
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you senator dandro um you
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
may not know the answer to this I can
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
probably try to ask the um Lottery
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
Commission but um I'm wondering if in
 
03:41:24.670 --> 03:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
the first section is the intent to
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
notify them ahead of when their license
 
03:41:31.469 --> 03:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
is about to expire because it says that
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
they need to send in their application
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
for Renewal 15 days before it expires
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
but the new section talks about
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
notifying them 45 days ahead of time
 
03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you thank you for the
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah that the the section we we
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
amended this in the Senate and it it
 
03:41:54.670 --> 03:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
says no less than 45 days before sex
 
03:41:57.550 --> 03:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
exploration or rejection so that do that
 
03:42:00.149 --> 03:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
gives them a period of time uh which I
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
think okay they they they probably they
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
need at this point that's good any other
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
berer thank you Mr chairman I I am
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
confused here okay applic um number two
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
applications for Renewal shall be
 
03:42:25.149 --> 03:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
received by commission 15 days prior to
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
expiration and then following up on
 
03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
comment is uh the section expires uh or
 
03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
is rejected for Renewal by the
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
commission no less than 45 days so if
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
the application is due 15 days prior to
 
03:42:47.710 --> 03:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
expiration is the
 
03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
expiration is the
commission

03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
notifying that renewal will be rejected
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
45 days
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
before the expiration which is 30 days
 
03:43:02.110 --> 03:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
before they would even have gotten an
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
application what am I missing here uh I
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think I'll look at the RO robot to
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
applications for Ral should be received
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
by the commission 50 days prior to
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
explanation unless such requirement is
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
waved by the commission for good cause
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
show the commission shall notify
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
licenses under RSA 287e if licenses
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
under the section expires or is rejected
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
for Renewal by the commission no less
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
than 45 days before such such such
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
expiration or or rejection just wanted
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
to put a time frame there so that
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
everybody was aware of that a that their
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
license was expiring or or has to be
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
renewed and if if it's going to be
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
rejected they should be notified early
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
also in both
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
cases followup follow thank you so I
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
then this means that if a license
 
03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:02.269 align:start position:0%
then this means that if a license
renewal

03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
03:44:05.189 --> 03:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
applicant is not going to be challenged
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
on a
 
03:44:10.389 --> 03:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
renewal that they won't have to to worry
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
they there will be no okay thank you
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly thank you exactly yeah
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
the idea is to keep consistency as I
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
said just like a driver's license your
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license is going to come up for
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
Redal you notif find it enough time to
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
make your appointment to get it same
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
thing with your driver registration you
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
notified at enough time to do it so you
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
don't you don't lose it and the problem
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
has been many of many of these entities
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
had have been losing their licenses and
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
and represent atives and Senators have
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
gone to the commission and worked with
 
03:44:44.990 --> 03:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
the commission to get an extension until
 
03:44:47.349 --> 03:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
things are are done and as I say the big
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
cfor of the situation is is the IRS
 
03:44:53.790 --> 03:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
because the 5013 C's are taking almost a
 
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
year to get
 
03:44:59.950 --> 03:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:59.960 --> 03:45:01.469 align:start position:0%
 
else

03:45:01.469 --> 03:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you Senator thank
 
03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
you very much sir great to be with you
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
you next I have um Valerie King from New
 
03:45:11.840 --> 03:45:32.510 align:start position:0%
you next I have um Valerie King from New
Hampshire

03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
lottery good morning my name is Valerie
 
03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
King I'm with New Hampshire lottery I
 
03:45:39.309 --> 03:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
oversee the division that deals with the
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
lucky s licensing
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
um I understand what uh Senator Dallas
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
Andro would like to do as far as
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
notifications we actually do provide
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
notifications currently we provide uh
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
notifications 60 days out than it that's
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
usually October we provide twice a um
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
every other week during the month of
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
November and once a week during the
 
03:46:04.189 --> 03:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
month of December but this would
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
formalize that process however I did
 
03:46:09.550 --> 03:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
want to point out a few wording issues
 
03:46:12.030 --> 03:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
that make this a little problematic for
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
us number one
 
03:46:18.910 --> 03:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
um about a third of our licenses are
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
monthly Lucky Seven licenses therefore
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
to give a 45-day notice they don't even
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
have a license yet so this should really
 
03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
just apply to those having an annual or
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
12 consecutive month license rather than
 
03:46:34.269 --> 03:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
to all
 
03:46:34.279 --> 03:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
to all
licenses

03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I wanted to point out
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
is that as far as
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
and um representative El elberger um not
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
noted that some of these sort of how do
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
we give a notice before it actually
 
03:46:52.030 --> 03:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
happens um so there is a little bit of
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
wording that should be refined but I
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out that
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
541a also addresses these already um RSA
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
541a 29 requires that the
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
agency um examine an application and
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
either approve or deny an application
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
within 60
 
03:47:14.750 --> 03:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
days and so and so we give notification
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not that was approved or
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
denied within that 60 day time period um
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
also um there's also RSA two uh 541 a30
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
which is the whole process for when
 
03:47:32.910 --> 03:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's been suspended or revoked and
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process on notification
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for that as well so we'd
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
want to be careful not to
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
um create any conflicts with those
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
statutes which are already in place okay
 
03:47:48.670 --> 03:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative PL could you
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
come up with specific wording which
 
03:47:52.830 --> 03:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
would alleviate your
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
concerns well I think
 
03:47:58.110 --> 03:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
541a already addresses the revocation
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
the um denials but we as far as the um
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
notifications prior to expiration that's
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's easy enough we we can just make
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
it so that it is for those lenses that
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
have hold a license for 12 consecutive
 
03:48:16.590 --> 03:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be doing us an immense favor to get
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of what Senator dallesandro
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
is trying to get pasted and make sure
 
03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have any conflicts or concerns
 
03:48:28.349 --> 03:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
great okay so um representative PL will
 
03:48:31.630 --> 03:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
you uh take the lead on getting
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:48:33.359 --> 03:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
that I
shall

03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Aly did you have
 
03:48:41.710 --> 03:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
your yes representative fellows thank
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
you um Can can you just tell me a little
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
bit about the application process and
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
what would be the um the issue related
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the nonprofits is is
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
it what is the timeline do they have to
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
get renewed every year is it their
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
reporting of their expenditures and
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
their revenue news that has Nines in the
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
number is it that form that has to come
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
to you or what what's the process are
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
you referring to the IRS issues
 
03:49:26.910 --> 03:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
yes so or the five five 501c3 issue
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
right the the 501 C uh they are required
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
to report do annual reports to the IRS
 
03:49:37.950 --> 03:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
if they fail to do do that and for three
 
03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
years they fall off the list they become
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
they go on the auto revocation list and
 
03:49:45.870 --> 03:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
if we find that they're on the auto
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
revocation list they're they don't meet
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
the requirements for licensure followup
 
03:49:53.550 --> 03:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
followup isn't there some kind of
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
provision for that that says if there if
 
03:49:59.469 --> 03:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
the money they ex either their revenue
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
or their expenditures were below a
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
certain dollar limit that they don't
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
have to do that what is it what is the
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
number of that report you know what I'm
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the nine has nine in it
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that that'd be an IRS question I I
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
think I know what you're referring to
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
but I don't know enough to answer that
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
question so you don't know if they're
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
not required to report when it's below a
 
03:50:26.670 --> 03:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
certain dollar
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount if they appear on the auto
 
03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:30.309 align:start position:0%
amount if they appear on the auto
revocation

03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
revocation
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
list then so what we look at when we're
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
looking at licensing is that they have a
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
501c status either a three four there's
 
03:50:40.189 --> 03:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
like seven of them
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
um and that they're they're currently
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
active so if they're on the auto
 
03:50:48.670 --> 03:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
revocation list that means they lost
 
03:50:54.149 --> 03:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
their um their tax exemption okay and do
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody here from the um
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
charitable Bureau that does the
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
501c3 things well let's um we can we can
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
check I don't know um we can check
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit
 
03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
yeah no no um representative spillsbury
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair so as I
 
03:51:23.070 --> 03:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
understand it you are proposing to
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
revise uh section one of this bill to
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
limit it to annual license renewals not
 
03:51:33.149 --> 03:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
short-term licenses and not
 
03:51:36.030 --> 03:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
revocations correct right and section
 
03:51:37.469 --> 03:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
two without having the statute here in
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
front of me um I'm presuming this
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
applies exclusively to Bingo and Lucky 7
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
just like section one does is that also
 
03:51:51.309 --> 03:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.389 --> 03:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
e25 so 19 just applies uh so the first
 
03:52:00.269 --> 03:52:00.279 align:start position:0%
section um which uh amends RSA 287 e19
 
03:52:03.550 --> 03:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's specific to Lucky 7 only I
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe that section 25 of that same
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
statute applies to
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
both to both Bingo but not to know other
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows um just
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
another re question related to the
 
03:52:25.149 --> 03:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
revocation list that you're looking at
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that a federal publication or the
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
state it's Federal it's the IRS Auto
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
revocation list and it's published on
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%

Committee for the afternoon uh my name

is Grant bossy from the New Hampshire
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
Senate introducing Senate Bill 363 on
 
03:54:04.590 --> 03:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Dan inis 14 years ago
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature made the decision to end
 
03:54:08.590 --> 03:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
greyhound racing in New Hampshire
 
03:54:10.110 --> 03:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
determining in that this cruel sport
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
leads to the suffering of many
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
Greyhounds yet the state still profits
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
from greyhound racing by allowing simoc
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
cast betting on outof State and foreign
 
03:54:20.910 --> 03:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
dog racing with no or minimal Animal
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
Welfare protections currently there's
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
only one location in New Hampshire that
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
offers Greyhound simoc casting the brook
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
in seab Brook better wager $500 million
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
annually on those races which cannot be
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
legally run here in the granite state
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
$500 million is a lot of money but it
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
only represents 1% of all bding at the
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
facility in physical year 2023 the state
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
received just under
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
$91,000 in revenue from greyhound racing
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
an amount that can be recovered many
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
times over with sports betting at the
 
03:54:54.870 --> 03:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
brook ending Greyhound simoc casting
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
will not endanger the brook or
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
significantly decrease state revenue it
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
would not affect Charities which do not
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
receive a share of Greyhound gambling
 
03:55:04.830 --> 03:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue it will bring our sports betting
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
in line with the values set by the ban
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
on greyhound racing for 14 years ago as
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill would have gone into
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
effect on July 1st 2025 the Senate Ways
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee agreed to an
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
amendment pushing that back to 2027
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
giving the brook three years to phase
 
03:55:23.950 --> 03:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
out Greyhound simonc casting Senator
 
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
inis ask you to do this for the dogs
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
they may not be in New Hampshire but
 
03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
they are suffering in part because of
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
the money Granite sters are betting if
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%

03:55:35.309 --> 03:55:35.319 align:start position:0%

360 three thank you thank you will you
 
03:55:44.189 --> 03:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
take any questions absolutely okay
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Amy thank you
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of the first
 
03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:53.389 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of the first
page

03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
on you have a definition of electronic
 
03:55:56.760 --> 03:55:58.750 align:start position:0%
on you have a definition of electronic
gaming

03:55:58.750 --> 03:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
devices and it says in the end and such
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
shall include but not be limited to
 
03:56:08.149 --> 03:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
video slot machines and other gambling
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
devices which function or are devised to
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
function like a video slot machine now I
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
believe I've used to be looking for it
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
um that you have not yet legalized video
 
03:56:28.590 --> 03:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
slot machines in this state is this
 
03:56:28.600 --> 03:56:30.510 align:start position:0%
slot machines in this state is this
doing

03:56:30.510 --> 03:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
it and does that mean that are mostly
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
casinos are going to turn into full
 
03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:40.590 align:start position:0%
casinos are going to turn into full
scale

03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
scale
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
hos uh I think the Lottery Commission
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
would be better set to answer that
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
question from my am but this bill only
 
03:56:51.309 --> 03:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
deletes simulcast dog racing on that
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
page it doesn't change the existing
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
definitions so I think the the current
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
definitions would hold and if I'm wrong
 
03:56:58.750 --> 03:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
about that I hope the lottery
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
Me Maybe the lottery Comm commission can
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
answer that thank
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
you uh um any more questions uh yes
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative PL I'm just pointing out
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
questions well you actually you can ask
 
03:57:22.670 --> 03:57:22.680 align:start position:0%

Carrie

03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
pH chair members of the committee uh
 
03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
Carrie teal executive director of grk
 
03:58:00.910 --> 03:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
USA uh very honored to be here today um
 
03:58:03.790 --> 03:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh before I give my comments just two
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
two brief points um to representative Al
 
03:58:08.429 --> 03:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
me the language on the bottom of page
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
one is all current law uh this bill is
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
not uh amending or changing in any way
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
the statute regarding slot machines um
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to clarify that uh also
 
03:58:24.269 --> 03:58:24.279 align:start position:0%
um uh in the previous testimony I I
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
think there may have been a just a a
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
misspeak uh it's not 500 million being
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
bet on gry hun racing in New Hampshire
 
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's year it's 5 million being bet 5.9
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
million to be exact so just wanted to
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that point um but as as was said
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh in 2010 14 years ago uh this
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislature voted to Outlaw wagering on
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
greyhound racing due to Animal Welfare
 
03:58:51.590 --> 03:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that vote happened in part
 
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
because of the support and Leadership of
 
03:58:57.389 --> 03:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
several members of this committee um so
 
03:59:00.189 --> 03:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
I want to thank thank uh those members
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
for that uh just to start with um today
 
03:59:06.910 --> 03:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are only two dog tracks left in
 
03:59:09.309 --> 03:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
the United States uh the company that
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
owns those final two tracks called
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
Delaware North has publicly said it once
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
out of Grey hun racing um there's
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation pending to end ghun
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
racing uh there's across the country uh
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
bills to Outlaw grey hun simal casting
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
or remote gambling on Grey hun racing or
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
pending those bills passed uh last year
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
in the states of Colorado and
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh a bill in Arizona which
 
03:59:37.149 --> 03:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
is virtually identical to this bill has
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate and is
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh I expect to pass the house in the
 
03:59:43.710 --> 03:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
coming weeks um so this is a trend the
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
reason it's important is uh as was
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously you know while grey
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
hun racing ends in the US we are seeing
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
foreign Dog Tracks come in and try to
 
03:59:56.830 --> 03:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
appeal to American gamblers for the
 
03:59:59.790 --> 03:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
first time uh the most troubling example
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
of this is until December uh the brook
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
was accepting bets from a track in Tiana
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
Mexico called AGA Cente which is owned
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
by an alleged cartel associate uh that
 
04:00:13.630 --> 04:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
track has no Animal Welfare concerns and
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously you know we have grave uh
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh grave concerns about that track
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the American Market
 
04:00:23.469 --> 04:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
both from an animal welfare perspective
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
and also just in general um when grey
 
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
hun racing ended uh simoc casting was
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue specifically to
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
protect the economic interests of sebr
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
and to serve as a bridge uh that that
 
04:00:42.510 --> 04:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
policy worked um to put it in context in
 
04:00:46.229 --> 04:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
2013 Gran simal casting amounted for
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
43% of all gambling business at the
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
brook today it is
 
04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
1% so obviously uh that facility has
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
Diversified it has moved Beyond Graham
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
simal casting and in fact it's a
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
facility that is thriving um I'm here
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
today to ask you to Simply close the
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
loophole that was left uh 14 years ago
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
go and simply say that this legislature
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
already uh chose the policy that grey
 
04:01:17.189 --> 04:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
hun racing should not be allowed uh
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
please uh also uh do not allow remote
 
04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
gambling on foreign dog races uh finally
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does have a three-year phase
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
out uh as a greyhound Advocate I don't
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
love that um my preference would be for
 
04:01:38.189 --> 04:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
gryan simal casting to end tomorrow um I
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
do do uh greatly appreciate the work of
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
Senator dandro and others in the Senate
 
04:01:46.590 --> 04:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
to work out this compromise which which
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
allowed for this bill to pass
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate and I
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
recognize even though that is not a date
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
I would have chosen that the legislative
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
process is a process that requires
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
compromise so that is that is the
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislation before you um I ask uh for
 
04:02:06.189 --> 04:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
your support on a to pass motion and
 
04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
I'll happy to answer any questions you
 
04:02:09.630 --> 04:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
may have
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes um you State uh
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
tried not to allow any uh foreign
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
betting this this doesn't refer to
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
foreign or domestic it simply eliminates
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to simoc cast dog hat thre
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't that take care of it that
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
that that that's correct representative
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
it does I I the reason I highlight the
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
foreign is uh I believe greyhound racing
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the next 5 years will end completely
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the United States and so at that that
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
point all you would have left would be
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
foreign Graham simoc casting okay please
 
04:02:46.750 --> 04:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
point out to me uh why dog racing is
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
different than horse racing and why the
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
the abuse you concern abuse about dogs
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
but not horses happy to thank you for
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
that question representative um and
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your support of the bill
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's two different animals if you
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't if you don't mind the pun um the
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
Animal Welfare Community is uniformly
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to Grey hun racing due to a
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
series of
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
standard practices that are intended to
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh secure the highest return from each
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
individual dog and uh well incurring the
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
least amount of cost so those are things
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
like intensive confinement in housing uh
 
04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
the large number of injuries dogs suffer
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh the fate of greyhounds when they stop
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
racing the use of drugs uh just to give
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
one example on that uh all female
 
04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
Greyhounds are given an anabolic steroid
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
called methyl testosterone as a matter
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
of course uh to reduce reduce a loss of
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
race days or prevent a loss of race days
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's an incredibly Reckless
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
practice the industry does it because
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
it's the least least expensive way for
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
them to prevent female Greyhounds from
 
04:03:54.070 --> 04:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
losing race days uh you know by contrast
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
um you know there's much more money
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
available in horse racing for the
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
animals care uh the Animal Welfare
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
Community uh as a whole is not opposed
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
to horse racing um and you know each
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
individual horse is obviously you know
 
04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
much more economically valuable than
 
04:04:12.189 --> 04:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
individual dog which means it's easier
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
to dispose of large numbers of dogs
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
versus horses so I I I think there are
 
04:04:19.389 --> 04:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
you know fundamental differences between
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
the two which is why quite frankly not
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
only in New Hampshire but across the
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
country state laws treat these two
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
industries differently they're regulated
 
04:04:29.710 --> 04:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
differently uh and the and the the
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
public discourse and political discourse
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
around these two industries have been uh
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
like night and
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
day thank thank you any other questions
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none not like an attorney that's
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
a question I asked I knew the answer
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
to well we could have saved Time by
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
having not
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
answered from the witness I put the
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%

and we won't belabor that I just point
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
out that in the Senate there was no
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
opposition uh in the hearing we didn't
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
hear I was told told by the industry
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative they were not going to
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh I Hope That Remains the Same in
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
this body and we can pass this
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%

04:06:28.149 --> 04:06:28.159 align:start position:0%

you but no bill number so I'm assuming
 
04:06:32.800 --> 04:06:35.389 align:start position:0%
you but no bill number so I'm assuming
it's

04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
in thank you Mr chairman uh Rick Newman
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
I'm representing uh Lakes Region Casino
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
castleblanca Casino which is one of the
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
same it's the uh facility in Belmont um
 
04:07:02.600 --> 04:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
same it's the uh facility in Belmont um
and

04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
um appear here in opposition to this
 
04:07:06.840 --> 04:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
um appear here in opposition to this
bill

04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the point of banning
 
04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
somal casting is to obviously impact the
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
industry as it still exists and has been
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
testified to there are only there is
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
only one state where live dog racing in
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire takes place that's in West
 
04:07:28.349 --> 04:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
Virginia uh West Virginia's two
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
facilities have to run live dog racing
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
in order to have the casinos that they
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
operate so that's state law now I agree
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
that there efforts to change that law
 
04:07:41.109 --> 04:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that may come to pass at some point
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
in time but in the meantime that live
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
racing is going to continue in West
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
Virginia and it's going to continue in
 
04:07:50.189 --> 04:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
England and Australia and other places
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
that have it where s casting takes place
 
04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
it is true that the brook is the current
 
04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
only facility in New Hampshire that uh
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
offers sual casting either horses or
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
dogs however the Belmont facility is
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
also grandfathered under the current
 
04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
statute and they were purchased a couple
 
04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
of years ago or a little longer than a
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and over that time
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
they've been doing some Renovations and
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
they've been getting uh historic horse
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
racing installed and doing some other
 
04:08:23.469 --> 04:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
things and now they're beginning to look
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
at the possibility of bringing back s
 
04:08:28.590 --> 04:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
casting and obviously s cast dog racing
 
04:08:30.189 --> 04:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
would be a big part of
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
that I just want to give a
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
quick history of this issue I've been
 
04:08:37.870 --> 04:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
involved in it for many years I was was
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
involved in it in
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
2009 when um up until that point it was
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
required that you run live racing in
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
order to be able to sble cast I
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
represented Belmont in those days and uh
 
04:08:54.269 --> 04:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
during the budget process of 2009 former
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative the late uh Steve Valen
 
04:08:59.469 --> 04:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
Court approached me about the
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of trying to make it
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
optional and representative uh former
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk on the finance
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh wanted to do that as well
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
because it was costing the state money
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
we were happy to join that effort
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
because live racing was very expensive
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
and so in the 2009 budget it was made
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
optional and I think it was the
 
04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
following year when uh after the tracks
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
had all stopped running live racing the
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
ban on live racing was passed but I want
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
to take exception to one comment that
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's a loophole this is somehow a
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
loophole this is not a loophole in fact
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cooney who sponsored the
 
04:09:43.229 --> 04:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
bill to ban live racing uh Senator Ro
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
Burge who was well-known animal rights a
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
guardian uh in those days and was a
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh both testified in the
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
Senate that it was not their intent in
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
any way to affect SEL casting it was
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
only to get to stop live racing
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative Mar Beth walls who was
 
04:10:03.870 --> 04:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
chair of the regulative revenues
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee also testified to that as did
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the gry 2K representative who testified
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
quote somal cast will continue so it
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
it's not a loophole that this remains it
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
is in fact uh it was an in fact
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
important part of the policy that was
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
made I just want to say in closing
 
04:10:28.189 --> 04:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the brook for instance you
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
can diminish the talk about the small
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of their total business but
 
04:10:35.790 --> 04:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
the reality is in
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
2023 track Revenue from somal cast dog
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
racing was $1.1 Million 1.1 million that
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
was the track share that's not nothing
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
that's a significant amount of money and
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
it so the effect of of this bill were to
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
pass it will hurt a New Hampshire
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
business it will cost some people their
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
jobs yeah it will it will impact the
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
state's uh budget not a lot about
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
$90,000 or so but it will have those
 
04:11:07.950 --> 04:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
adverse effects here it will have no
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
other effects anywhere else and while I
 
04:11:12.630 --> 04:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
was sitting here waiting for the hearing
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
I just went on my phone and found about
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
seven places where I can bet on dog
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
races online and uh so if if this bill
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
passes people there are there is there
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
are people who like to bet on dog races
 
04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
and if this bill passes the people who
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
are currently doing it in seaber and the
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
people that Belmont hopes will do it in
 
04:11:35.790 --> 04:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
Belmont if they just if they open up S
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
cast will simply use these online
 
04:11:41.109 --> 04:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
betting sites to bet dog racing so I
 
04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
guess my point is there's there's no
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
particular positive impact on the world
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
of dog racing itself its negative impact
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
on businesses in New Hampshire and it
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
may just be enough to keep Belmont from
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
going forward with the idea of going
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
back into simal casting because it is a
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
significant part of the simal
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
cast uh business so with that Mr
 
04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I would ask you to consider U
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill or perhaps send it to
 
04:12:13.149 --> 04:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
study to see what else happens in the
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
industry in West
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
Virginia thank
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
you yes representative sting yeah uh
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh would you have any
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
information about the current Humane
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
conditions of uh the dog track uh dogs
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
are they is there been a change in the
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
treatment of them I don't
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
sir I am aware that like other states
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pass law for instance
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
prior to the Banning that required the
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
tracking of injuries those sorts of
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
things I assume that that's happened
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
other as I said there's only one state
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
left what happens in Europe I would have
 
04:12:49.319 --> 04:12:53.349 align:start position:0%
left what happens in Europe I would have
no

04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
idea okay seeing no more questions thank
 
04:12:56.720 --> 04:12:58.870 align:start position:0%

04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
statute uh
 
04:14:06.239 --> 04:14:08.309 align:start position:0%
statute uh
C3

04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
C3
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
on it says that there shall not be
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
anything like a slot
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
machine yes representative Aly um there
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill that's in front of us uh and
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
again this is existing language there's
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
a general prohibition on uh
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
authorization of electronic gaming
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
devices um which mimic slot machines
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise authorized by the
 
04:14:35.550 --> 04:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
general court um so if the anticipating
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
your question regarding perhaps historic
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines those were
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%

04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%

04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming devices sh mean on is
 
04:15:05.950 --> 04:15:05.960 align:start position:0%

454 on behalf of Senator Dan Enis the
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
bills Prime sponsor the shortage of
 
04:16:36.670 --> 04:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is not only a
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
challenge for New Hampshire families but
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
an obstacle to the state's economic
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
growth and well-being makes it harder
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
for businesses to find employees leaves
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
gaps in the New Hampshire Workforce
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen critical shortages for nurses
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
teachers and other professionals it
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
makes it harder for young professionals
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire to start a
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
career and a family and it comes back to

increased by 18% that year the highest
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
in over a decade and of those new
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%

04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
housing projects last year the
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%

04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
housing shortage in New Hampshire but we

Loren and I'm the executive director at
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region Community developers we're
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%

04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
housing um based in lonia and uh we
 
04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
serve the entire Lakes Region so we go
 
04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
all the way up to Ashland Plymouth area
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
down to Franklin over to oopy um we've
 
04:19:28.510 --> 04:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
been developing affordable housing in
 
04:19:31.349 --> 04:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
The Lakes Region since the late 80s and
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to speak in favor of SV
 
04:19:37.229 --> 04:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
454 um I can say from our experience you
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
know we put really great projects
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
together every year and the biggest
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
constraint is funding to build them so
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um doubling the the carve out from the
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax would have a
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
really big impact on the resources that
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
are available um that New Hampshire
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
housing has available to put into
 
04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
projects um stretching those Federal
 
04:20:00.030 --> 04:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
resources that the state gets even
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
further every year and continuing to
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
make a dent in in the housing crisis so
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much um for your time
 
04:20:08.309 --> 04:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions if you
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
have any do you do you know actually you
 
04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
may not be the appropriate person to ask
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
but when this bill the 5 million the
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
original bill went into effect how many
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you um any questions
 
04:20:32.239 --> 04:20:33.189 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you um any questions
represent

04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
elme yeah
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
um what do you use the same definition
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing as is used for
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing or what's your
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
definition that's a great question so we
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
build a number of different housing
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
products we use the low-income housing
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
tax credit program to build rentals and
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
those are primarily for people that are
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
under 60% of the median income but we
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
also and and I would classify most of
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
those people as essential workers and
 
04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
also seniors that live on a low fixed
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
income that's the bulk of our tenants um
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
in that housing product uh we also do
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing for people who tend
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be extremely of extremely low income
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
less than 30% of the median and those
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
folks are often experiencing
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness or at very high risk of
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
homelessness um we've attempted to do
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership in the past
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
but haven't been able to make one of
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
those work yet so we're we're very
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
interested in serving as many you know
 
04:21:36.070 --> 04:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
income brackets as possible but the
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
states of affordable housing fund which
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
is where the money would go from the
 
04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax um can have a
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
role in any of the any of the types of
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
housing that we build so we find it to

has already been said we know we're in
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
the in a housing Crunch and a housing
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
crisis so I'm just going to skim ahead
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
to the critical points that are unique
 
04:22:56.349 --> 04:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
to the realtor's position um first of
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
all I'd be remiss if I didn't on behalf
 
04:23:00.189 --> 04:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the The Association of Realtors thank
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
you and other legislators for your work
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
last year on house B2 uh you recognize
 
04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
the lack of a affordable housing and
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
made appropriate uh allocations of
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
historical funding last year however we
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
continue to see the need and uh the a
 
04:23:18.070 --> 04:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund is one of the
 
04:23:20.189 --> 04:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
more flexible funds that New Hampshire
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
housing administers in order to create
 
04:23:22.800 --> 04:23:23.710 align:start position:0%
housing administers in order to create
housing

04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities so we certainly
 
04:23:28.349 --> 04:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically we as the Realtors
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support this bill we
 
04:23:33.790 --> 04:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
would have concerns however if there was
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
any increase to the real real estate
 
04:23:38.109 --> 04:23:38.119 align:start position:0%
transfer ER tax and this bill does not
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
do that we would also be equally
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
concerned if efforts were made to
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
dedicate transfer tax receipts to
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
funding which is not directly related to
 
04:23:49.389 --> 04:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
the expansion of housing opportunities
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
in our state because this bill does
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
neither of those things increase the
 
04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
transfer tax nor does it U dedicate
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
funds outside of uh housing
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities we fully support this bill
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
and uh it amounts to uh a strong step
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
forward what our state needs for
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional housing opportunities and
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any questions
 
04:24:11.800 --> 04:24:14.269 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any questions
thank

04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.910 --> 04:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
you questions yes represented fellows so
 
04:24:21.790 --> 04:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
I um thank you I think we just heard
 
04:24:25.710 --> 04:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
that it was just it was let's say three
 
04:24:30.309 --> 04:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
years ago that this first allotment of
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
$5 million was put in the
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I'll let you finish your
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
question I was what I'm interested in is
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
what has that money been used for can
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
you translate it into units built or
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
anything like that thank you
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative for the question and if I
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
could Mr chair and representative uh I
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
think either uh executive director Rob
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
dais or deputy director Ben Frost of New
 
04:25:01.870 --> 04:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing would probably be more
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate to answer the particulars of
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
the question and the history of the
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund is that okay
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%

04:25:14.590 --> 04:25:14.600 align:start position:0%

role uh I am uh the board chair for New
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%

representative thank you very much thank
you

04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.880 --> 04:25:43.950 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:25:43.950 --> 04:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
microphone at this point uh you you were
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying when I was finishing writing
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
about the transfer tax you were saying
 
04:25:52.830 --> 04:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
something about
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
dedicating uh that we shouldn't be
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
dedicating funds somewhere
 
04:26:00.790 --> 04:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
else yes the the Realtors support the uh
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
the allocation from the existing real
 
04:26:05.229 --> 04:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax to opportunities to
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
expand housing
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
we would be concerned if funds from the
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax were used in
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
another purpose other than expanding
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
housing and they are already and have
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
been for quite a long time used by the
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
fund and that this specific bill doesn't
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
deal with the the trust fund so that's
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
why I was okay phrasing it thank you
 
04:26:29.439 --> 04:26:31.149 align:start position:0%

04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
populations and income
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
levels uh it's coming online as we uh uh
 
04:28:35.109 --> 04:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
every every month and so as the info
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
sheets go around you'll you'll see some
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative projects that we've used
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
those affordable housing funds for and
 
04:28:42.030 --> 04:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
as those projects come online they're
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
improving neighborhoods they're
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
improving Health outcomes and work
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
Readiness among New Hampshire residents
 
04:28:49.389 --> 04:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
and decreasing homelessness and housing
 
04:28:51.550 --> 04:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
instability we make affordable housing
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
funds available through two basic
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
channels uh one is in combination with
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
the federal housing tax credit that's
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
the so-called litec that Carmen
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh and using AHF in
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
combination with the federal housing
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
credit uh leveraging of State resources
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the range of 7 to 12 uh federal or
 
04:29:12.030 --> 04:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
private investment dollars for every
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
state dollar that's invested um because
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
the tax credit program is designed to
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
leave a gap in the financing to require
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
some commensurate investment at the
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
state level if we didn't provide that
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
financing uh certain federal housing
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
credits and tax against Bond financing
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
would go
 
04:29:33.309 --> 04:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
unused uh in addition to that we uh use
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing funds for our
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing program
 
04:29:38.189 --> 04:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
affordable housing funds have fewer
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
strings attached uh than federal funds
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
and so they're much more flexible the
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
support of housing program has been used
 
04:29:46.590 --> 04:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh for housing that serves people with
 
04:29:48.309 --> 04:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
mental illness developmental
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities substance use disorders and
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
other special needs uh and much of the
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
small scale housing in New Hampshire
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
Community serving people in those
 
04:29:57.870 --> 04:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
populations has been developed with
 
04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
financing all properties financed with
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
AHF are affordable for at least 20 years
 
04:30:06.349 --> 04:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
by law uh affordable period of
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
affordability periods of 30 to 60 years
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
are also common uh depending on the
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
other funding sources that are involved
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh we'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
Ames well first off I think it's a great
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
program um my concern is the dedication
 
04:30:33.159 --> 04:30:34.750 align:start position:0%
program um my concern is the dedication
of

04:30:34.750 --> 04:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
money um to this program from the real
 
04:30:40.990 --> 04:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
estate transfer fund
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
revenues uh and you have $5 million that
 
04:30:47.070 --> 04:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
was put in in
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
2020 um before that you got as I
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
understand for this fund um
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations were made in the budget
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the to the extent to which
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
the state put money in that was the
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
source um so in the
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
budget so we've move from a budget
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
to um taking from a stream of Revenue an
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money and now the proposal is
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
to double that um and as been as has
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
been pointed out that stream of money
 
04:31:25.630 --> 04:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
supports education it goes into the
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and it's also true
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
that this
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
year the and maybe last year I don't
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
recall the money going into
 
04:31:43.269 --> 04:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
the uh trust fund from the real estate
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
transfer tax collections has been going
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
down um so we're sort of in a bit of a
 
04:31:54.189 --> 04:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
crunch here education is under the gun
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
public school funding is under the gun
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're not spending enough that's what
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
the judge says we're reviewing that
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
we've just had a couple of bills this
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
morning that we've been working on
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
that call for a different way of funding
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
and more more funding
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
variously um so we've got that in
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
play uh and really the question here is
 
04:32:21.239 --> 04:32:22.510 align:start position:0%
play uh and really the question here is
why

04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
not um I think I know the answer but I
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
might as well ask you why not compete in
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
the budget process for
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
funding um as you did to start off uh
 
04:32:40.109 --> 04:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
rather than then um uh get by Statute an
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
assured flow of funding that's in
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
independent of the interplay and the the
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
tradeoffs that occur in a regular budget
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
process where you're struggling with
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
competing priorities for important
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
projects sure thank you for the question
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative and I think uh the to to
 
04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
give us a simple answer to a simple
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
question the uh or the sort of last part
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
of that question the importance of
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
having a dedicated
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
set aside and this is why the
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
legislature saw fit to make that uh
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
policy Choice a couple of years ago is
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
that these projects take years to
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
develop and during that process
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
developers are investing hundreds of
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to uh bring
 
04:33:20.349 --> 04:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
projects forward and it's important for
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
them to have the predictability of
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that there will be a resource on
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
the other end and prior to the
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
establishment of the set aside uh that
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
didn't exist and as a result we saw much
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
less development of affordable housing
 
04:33:32.429 --> 04:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
relative to uh neighboring states and
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
other states of a sort of a similar size
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
in population and demogra Graphics um $5
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
million doesn't go as far as it used to
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so uh I think $10 million is what we
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
see as being necessary sort of um I hate
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
to put it this way but at a minimum to
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
provide that kind of predictability in
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
terms of our ability to continue to
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
operate a functional housing development
 
04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
program um if I may just note that
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the um I'm not an education
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
funding policy expert but I believe the
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
reason that uh has gone down is because
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
real estate transer tax receipts have
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
gone down and that's largely a function
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
of reduced transac transaction activity
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
because there is so little housing
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's such scarcity on both the rental
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
side and the for sale side that very few
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
people are moving because they don't
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
have someplace to move to so the uh
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
transfer tax receipts go down and I
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
think that's why uh Mr Norwood was
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
testifying earlier on behalf of the
 
04:34:29.310 --> 04:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
realtors in in favor of this
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you and that's
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
helpful representative lley thank thank
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um thank you for the
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
handout I was looking at this online at
 
04:34:42.429 --> 04:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
the same time I just had a question on
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
this graphic it says 11
 
04:34:50.470 --> 04:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
here age restricted 310 units is that a
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
percent what does 11 mean 11 projects
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
which comprise 310 units so I'm looking
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
at this I'm just trying to understand
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
would it be accurate to say like 10% of
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
your work is age
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
restricted projects
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
roughly okay yeah I'm asking because the
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
last week we discussed Workforce housing
 
04:35:22.590 --> 04:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
and obviously one of the stipulations of
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing is that it not be age
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
restricted and um there's a lot of Need
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
for Workforce housing and affordable
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
housing that's not um age restricted so
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to get a grasp on how much
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
of of your work um was in that area and
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a small amount
 
04:35:40.760 --> 04:35:42.429 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a small amount
10%

04:35:42.429 --> 04:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
10%
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the other uh question I had relates
 
04:35:50.590 --> 04:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
to uh your statement that I think is
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
very helpful to Think Through about you
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
know the availability of Housing and I
 
04:35:58.029 --> 04:35:58.039 align:start position:0%
think that the availability of quality
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
education also impacts the housing
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
market um I live in
 
04:36:06.150 --> 04:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and when we hire
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know a CEO to come in to run
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
something in Manchester they often
 
04:36:14.349 --> 04:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
choose not to buy House of
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I can tell you that
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
there's one reason for that and it's the
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
reputation of the education in
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester so I would just want to kind
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
of raise that idea of funding our
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
education um equitably across the state
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
also impacts people's housing values um
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that these are intertwined
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
issues that we need to think about and
 
04:36:42.990 --> 04:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
housing stability is super important um
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
for children uh getting educated if they
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
can have a stable place to live that
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
really helps their ability to learn so I
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
think it is complex and interrelated and
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
both deal with the well-being of our our
 
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
kids um our Workforce and our older
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
population so I'm I guess I'm wondering
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
how how your work plays out across the
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
state is it um are you involv are these
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
projects in all over the state are you
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
geographically more um active in certain
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
areas can you speak kind kind of walk us
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
through some of the geography of your
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
work I'd be happy to thank you for the
 
04:37:26.189 --> 04:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
question representative and we do work
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
Statewide and so we have uh properties
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
of of the uh properties that we've
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
developed they exist in certainly every
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
county in the state and and many many
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
many communities I would say most of the
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
real estate activity is is going on in
 
04:37:41.709 --> 04:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
kind of the Southern Tier and in certain
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
sort of uh hotspots like the Upper
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
Valley and and uh and around Keane but
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
um but we do continue to uh work with
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
Partners uh in The Lakes Region and
 
04:37:54.510 --> 04:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
north of that and part of that is
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
Preservation of existing affordable
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
housing which is an important priority
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
as well and and affordable housing fund
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
is very useful for that purpose um but I
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
think the short answer is we work in
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
every area of the state areas that more
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
populists generally see more uh real
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
estate activity of every sort and that
 
04:38:08.920 --> 04:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
estate activity of every sort and that
includes

04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
affordable representative
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you Mr chair
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that we know is
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:38:27.629 --> 04:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
2020 the legislature made a change and
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
so now you've been receiving $5 million
 
04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
annually for this affordable housing
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
fund so that was a big change from what
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
you had and it's supposed to be it's a
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
revolving fund so a lot of it is loans
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
but you know you give the money out and
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
the payments are coming back in what how
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
has this affected the balance of that
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
fund you know
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
regard where where we are right now so
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're considering what we might want to
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
make a change but right now H how is
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
that impacting your available funds to
 
04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
give out every year sure thank you for
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
the question representative and and so
 
04:39:11.551 --> 04:39:11.561 align:start position:0%
uh the the funds that have been
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
allocated and received to date have
 
04:39:14.590 --> 04:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
essentially been fully reserved to
 
04:39:16.590 --> 04:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
projects and just to explain how we
 
04:39:18.750 --> 04:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
structure it when we put a loan into a
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
project so that it can uh charge
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
affordable rents and and instead of the
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
sort of market rate of say $2,000 to
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
$2,500 a month U rent for something
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know perhaps $1,100 or
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
something that's affordable for somebody
 
04:39:34.510 --> 04:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
making 60% of the area median income we
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
structure that debt as a second loan uh
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
in second position in terms of its its
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
mortgage position and no it's it's not
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
like a home mortgage you don't need to
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
make principal and interest payments
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
every month uh we do uh structure it so
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
that if the project cash flows if uh if
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying their rent and and
 
04:39:55.628 --> 04:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
they're able to pull pay the full rent
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little bit will come back we
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
take 50% of the Project's cash flow uh
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
each year um but to answer your question
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
about what that means in terms of our we
 
04:40:06.750 --> 04:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
revolving yet like it has a lot of that
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
money come back and are we able to
 
04:40:10.628 --> 04:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
redeploy it um the answer is no because
 
04:40:13.230 --> 04:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
generally affordable housing projects
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
indeed we underwrite them to just barely
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
break even so that we're not putting in
 
04:40:18.390 --> 04:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
any more public dollars than is
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
necessary they're servicing their debt
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know these last couple of years
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
have been a rocky ride as you can
 
04:40:25.948 --> 04:40:25.958 align:start position:0%
imagine between utility costs Insurance
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up substantially and so
 
04:40:30.270 --> 04:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I think speaks to the impact of the
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund because those
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
second mortgages that we put in with AHF
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
do not require monthly payments those
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
projects are able to maintain their
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
economic stability and and still take
 
04:40:44.270 --> 04:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
care of the facilities uh and and be
 
04:40:47.070 --> 04:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
nice places to live is that was that
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
clear enough representative did that
 
04:40:48.240 --> 04:40:49.070 align:start position:0%
clear enough representative did that
make

04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
sense so that was very
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
enlightening so now my question is it
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really sound like a revolving
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
fund so it sounds like most of the money
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
is just I don't know what to I I would
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
call it grants I think you probably
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
subsidies maybe is a better word so
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're subsidizing it and it's not
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
really meant to be a pot of money that
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
that grows and can be reused is that or
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
most of it is in that category it's more
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
like an appropriation that you can give
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
out to
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
subsidize the existence
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
of subsidized housing I think that's a
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
fair point representative in most ways
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
it behaves like a subsid I mean I think
 
04:41:37.390 --> 04:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's different in that if a
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
property were sold at the end of the
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
affordability period all that money
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
would come back to the affordable
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
housing fund uh and and there are
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
occasionally projects that cash flow and
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
and we do receive that money back we
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
don't take any admin off it we put it
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
right back into other projects it's just
 
04:41:52.350 --> 04:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
not a substantial amount that would
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
allow us to kind of you know do a new
 
04:41:56.830 --> 04:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
project every two years for for each
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
project that we Finance or something
 
04:41:58.080 --> 04:42:00.750 align:start position:0%
project that we Finance or something
like

04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
that uh representative elme did you have
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
a followup uh no follow up on a question
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
not a followup but actually it's
 
04:42:11.230 --> 04:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
followup to something quite a bit ago
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
but on in the bad old days when you were
 
04:42:16.910 --> 04:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
getting a million dollars a year out of
 
04:42:16.920 --> 04:42:17.830 align:start position:0%
getting a million dollars a year out of
the

04:42:17.830 --> 04:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:17.840 --> 04:42:19.350 align:start position:0%
the
legislature

04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:42:23.070 --> 04:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
on FR from the budget
 
04:42:28.510 --> 04:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
on the you were also as I recall doing a
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
lot of age
 
04:42:33.070 --> 04:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
related um age
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
limited on projects because that was all
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
that the towns were willing to allow to
 
04:42:40.360 --> 04:42:41.470 align:start position:0%
that the towns were willing to allow to
go

04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:42:46.990 --> 04:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
up and um how many of these
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
11 restricted age restricted units are
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
from before the time when when you
 
04:42:57.990 --> 04:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
money I don't know we can find out the
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that representative uh I I
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of the 11 a district
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
projects we financed with AHF are from
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh the old days we still do a little bit
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
of age restricted housing but it's true
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um you know I guess I would say
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
also needed but maybe not quite as
 
04:43:16.680 --> 04:43:18.150 align:start position:0%
also needed but maybe not quite as
urgently

04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
urgently
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
as as the
 
04:43:24.110 --> 04:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
youth right and I go ahead Ben one thing
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
I would add representative Aly is um
 
04:43:28.030 --> 04:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're very generous in in your
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
characterization of uh the the earlier
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh in fact they didn't
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
get to a million sometimes they did not
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
get to a million sometimes in fact u a
 
04:43:38.670 --> 04:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
number of years many years most years
 
04:43:42.990 --> 04:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
they were zero it was 5 million once
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
ited 2001 I believe it started with an
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation in 1988 of $4 million the
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
next appropriation was in 2002 and that
 
04:43:58.990 --> 04:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
was $5 million uh over the first 30
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
years of the affordable housing funds
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
existence uh the legislature made
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
appropriations of of $22.6 million which
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
over time really is not a whole lot of
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
money it's only with uh the recent
 
04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
onetime Appropriations made by the
 
04:44:18.430 --> 04:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and the
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh transfer tax uh uh allocation
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
that we've seen more substantial
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that has allowed us to do
 
04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
more all right uh yes I'm going to take
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
one more question represent Alberta
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I live in ashaa
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
and drive past the Monahan man projects
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was really fun watching the old
 
04:44:43.948 --> 04:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
buildings come down and the new ones
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
come up and then starting to be
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
repopulated so thanks um I'm wondering
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you know about funds available
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
through the federal GAO and
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
transportation department to be used
 
04:44:59.200 --> 04:45:01.230 align:start position:0%
transportation department to be used
for

04:45:01.230 --> 04:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
redeveloping no longer being used
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
Federal property
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
and whether you've done any work
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
out we've had this uh conversation
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
before I think about a month ago uh and
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh we we've not historically done that
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
but we will be looking into it okay
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%

04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
policy so everyone in New Hampshire has
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
a place to call home our members are
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
those who develop Finance manage and
 
04:46:04.350 --> 04:46:04.360 align:start position:0%

04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
support of housing properties homeless
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
service agencies public housing agencies
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
and low-income family advocates
 
04:46:16.030 --> 04:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
um I won't repeat uh prior testimony I
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
will um underscore that the housing
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
crisis has been identified in at least
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
three recent polls as the number one
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
issues number one issue facing Granite
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
Staters um I think uh I've been doing
 
04:46:32.430 --> 04:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
this now since 2009 I think that that's
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
because the housing crisis is now now
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
impacting everyone um we have Workforce
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
shortages in every sector including
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
essential services disincentives for
 
04:46:45.070 --> 04:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
business growth barriers for young
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
families to call New Hampshire home
 
04:46:49.470 --> 04:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
challenges for housing choice for
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
retirees and debilitating Financial
 
04:46:55.628 --> 04:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
impacts on lower income families um and
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to connect that now to
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the affordable housing
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
fund um in the late 80s uh when uh the
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
public private partnership uh gained
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
momentum as a solution and using
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
financing tools uh to develop affordable
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
housing these trust funds were created
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
in every state unfortunately New
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was one of uh I believe only
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
three states that did not dedicate a
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
funding source for its trust fund and so
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
we at housing action New Hampshire um
 
04:47:31.948 --> 04:47:31.958 align:start position:0%
really were formed in a way to change
 
04:47:37.548 --> 04:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
that here um the uh Most states fund
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
their trust funds with a fee additional
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
fee on real estate
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
transactions that was not a viable
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
solution in the state um and so years
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
and years we worked with our friends the
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
Realtors and a lot of thoughtful
 
04:47:54.510 --> 04:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislators to identify a different
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
approach a different New Hampshire
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
approach and that big agreement came
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
around in 2020 that you've identified
 
04:48:03.628 --> 04:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
and that was a car out approach this
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
idea that the market when left on its
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
own is developing this revenue for the
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
state but that it this Market when left
 
04:48:13.548 --> 04:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
on its own is not building affordable
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
options that diverse housing stock and
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
it is creating not only extreme pressure
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
on very low-income families but also you
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
know a a gap in our Workforce and all
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
the other things I just identified so
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
this solution of the car out um uh
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
started as you note and um the feedback
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
back from membership from our members is
 
04:48:38.670 --> 04:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
we need more predictability in that
 
04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
process like 5 million wasn't enough to
 
04:48:43.310 --> 04:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
get the attention of a lot of developers
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
who are going to be putting in
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of you know
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
preconstruction Investments so uh New
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need to step up and then we
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
had those discussions and got to this
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
agreement um and so I hope that you'll
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh consider that because this has been
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
in discussion for a long time and I'll
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
also note that the bill was amended in
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
the Senate so that this would start uh
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
in the next bium so it is not impacting
 
04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
this budget and I'll conclude my
 
04:49:13.390 --> 04:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um and I'd be happy to take
 
04:49:13.400 --> 04:49:16.190 align:start position:0%
testimony um and I'd be happy to take
any

04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%

trust fund transfer eyeballing it it
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
looks like it might be a third but let
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's uh 33% of the real estate
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
transfer tax goes to the education trust
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
fund and the remainder is in the um
 
04:50:20.000 --> 04:50:22.548 align:start position:0%
fund and the remainder is in the um
general

04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
fund okay anybody have any question yes
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
repres well I thought we were just told
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
that since 2020 that 5 million of it was
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
going to this affordable housing
 
04:50:37.150 --> 04:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
so the uh the cash plan that I'm working
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
off of takes into account the 5 million
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to the affordable housing fund is
 
04:50:44.670 --> 04:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
there any other follow up is there any
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
else um there is the lchip program so
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
that plan I I believe that does not
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
include the lchip either that program do
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
you I mean the budget plan sorry not
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
program do you have those
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
figures I do not have the lchip St
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's with
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
me if you could and that that's um and
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
that's a function of the r that month is
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
um what would go to lchip and that is um
 
04:51:17.948 --> 04:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
that is um remitted separately so
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's the r and then there's the lchip
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
portion they're two separate things okay
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
if is it possible to send us send the
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee the breakdown of the real
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax on sure work
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you representative
 
04:51:33.400 --> 04:51:35.708 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you representative
Ames

04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll get it when you send that
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we do get it regularly but can you
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
update us on the uh R uh revenues for
 
04:51:49.390 --> 04:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year actually I so I have um
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
through February so year to date um we
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
are we are at $131 million
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
collected um and the plan is
 
04:52:07.390 --> 04:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
year to date so we are uh 20.7 million
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
below plan at the moment but that plan
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
would would go or the year ends what
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
June 30th June 30th so it seems like
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's tracking in a way that it should be
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
so it's just the first half of the year
 
04:52:24.910 --> 04:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
has been very weak we're just coming I
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
think um what it's starting to look like
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the growth rate of
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
transactions from January and February
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
and a little bit of December that we're
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
starting to finally see some growth in
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
transactions um so we're hoping that in
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
the back half we might be able to make
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
up some ground but that's to be seen
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
right it's it's still we're nowhere near
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
the um highs that we saw in fiscal year
 
04:52:53.310 --> 04:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
21 which was peak in terms of
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
transactions and what was holding the
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
tax up was that even though the
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
transactions were going down the medium
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
the medium price had remained pretty
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
high and it was really the end of last f
 
04:53:05.788 --> 04:53:05.798 align:start position:0%
year and the first half of this fiscal
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
year we're starting to see where the
 
04:53:10.030 --> 04:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
median couldn't support um any further
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
growth in the red thank
 
04:53:16.110 --> 04:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
04:53:18.190 --> 04:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I'm sorry represent spsb
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
just gonna um do you happen to have with
 
04:53:23.948 --> 04:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
you uh what was the r collections
 
04:53:26.310 --> 04:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
year-to date last year and the year
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
before and the plan for
 
04:53:32.350 --> 04:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
those because I I know our Revenue
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
projections uh were decreased
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
substantially for R yes so last year
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
year to date was aund um and this is
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
both when I'm speaking it's the general
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
fund and the education trust fund
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
together so last year year to date was
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
159.000 compared to the 131.8 million
 
04:53:56.948 --> 04:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
this year and the year before
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
that H I'd have to calculate
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I only have the individual
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
months not the sum of that so
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
well you want to give me a moment I can
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
pull I can calculate it I have it just
 
04:54:08.638 --> 04:54:17.270 align:start position:0%
pull I can calculate it I have it just
not

04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.628 --> 04:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
summed while she's calculating that is
 
04:54:21.788 --> 04:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
there anyone else after this that would
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
want to speak on
 
04:54:24.558 --> 04:54:28.510 align:start position:0%
want to speak on
sb4

04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.600 --> 04:54:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
way

04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
151.50 Million at at this point in
 
04:54:53.548 --> 04:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and that does not include
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing transfer because
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
that all occurs at the end of September
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we've already seen that money leave
 
04:54:59.520 --> 04:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
so we've already seen that money leave
the

04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
fund okay any fur other
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:55:10.110 --> 04:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
much okay I'm going to close the public
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.638 --> 04:55:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
454

04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
454
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open I'm going to open the
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.350 --> 04:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
you so I'll need U you'll just have
 
04:55:48.910 --> 04:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.920 --> 04:55:59.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh good morning chairman members of
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
the uh house Ways and Means Committee uh
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
happy to be back in this room after
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
serving three terms in it when I was in
 
04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
the house I very much like this room um
 
04:56:12.990 --> 04:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill that you have before you
 
04:56:14.830 --> 04:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
cleans up a process that happens to
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
unclaim horse racing and unclaimed horse
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
racing tickets and at the same time
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
supports the governor scholarship fund
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
which is for our New Hampshire graduates
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
um here in New Hampshire attending
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
attending New Hampshire colleges um most
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
unclaimed monies go to the state treasur
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then held for an additional 24 month
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
mons if no one claims the money it's
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
finally rotated into the general fund
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
unclaimed gaming money ALS also goes to
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
treasure but with historic horse racing
 
04:56:44.030 --> 04:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
in particular um there's no way to
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
identify who receives the prize because
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's just a little slip you get when you
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
place the BET um it's not tied to an
 
04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
individual um uh and but the players
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
would then take that slip and go up and
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
cash out with the at the at the um
 
04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
machine occasionally people don't cash
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
them out and that money just kind of
 
04:57:04.110 --> 04:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
hangs out on the books of the gaming
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
operators um until such point it's 24
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
months old and then they submit it to
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
the treasurer's office would then hold
 
04:57:12.030 --> 04:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
it for another 24 months and then it
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
would finally hit the general register
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to fix that delay and
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
that problem um this bill states that on
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
July One chedle gaming operators must
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
total up the unclaimed horse racing and
 
04:57:25.708 --> 04:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing money for the
 
04:57:27.390 --> 04:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
previous calendar year and write a check
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the treasurer and then that money
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
will be deposited directly into um the
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship fund um as I call
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
your attention to the bill I'm going to
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
ask you to make some corrections there
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
are two mistakes in the bill um that I
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
caught after um it passed the Senate um
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
so on line four of the introduced Bill
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see it it crosses out or historic
 
04:57:50.910 --> 04:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
horse racing you need to add that back
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
in um there was a discussion and I don't
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
remember getting a committee vote but
 
04:57:56.670 --> 04:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay it somehow ended up in the
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill and over here and then on line 14
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
we have an undefined term historic horse
 
04:58:04.590 --> 04:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
racing gaming operators or or horse
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
racing gaming operators we don't have
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
that defined anywhere in statute it
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
should be the same thing that's on line
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
three it should be any person
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
Association or Corporation shall submit
 
04:58:20.750 --> 04:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
what line 14 so line 14 it says on July
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
one of every year historic racing game
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
operators there's no definition of that
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the statute what it really
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
should say is um any person uh
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
Association or
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
Corporation and then that'll correct the
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
two errors that are on this
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill as it comes to revenue um what this
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill means is that currently it's about
 
04:58:43.868 --> 04:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
200,000 for horse racing that are
 
04:58:45.628 --> 04:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
unclaimed monies that would go annually
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the general fund um here we're adding
 
04:58:50.590 --> 04:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
the new the historic horse racing which
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't hit a reporting date yet we're
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
adding that in so it'll be about 400
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
Grand a year would go into the governor
 
04:58:59.548 --> 04:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to support New
 
04:59:00.750 --> 04:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students attending New
 
04:59:03.270 --> 04:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire colleges for scholarships if
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
you don't know how that scholarship
 
04:59:06.548 --> 04:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
works you have to be a firsttime student
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
um attending in in a an a Hampshire
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
graduate and you're able to apply um it
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
pays full tuition doesn't play room
 
04:59:16.030 --> 04:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
aboard but it play up to 100% of tuition
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
for uh someone going to UNH Plymouth
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
State Keen State Granite well I don't
 
04:59:22.670 --> 04:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
know if Granite State still exists um
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
but any of the New Hampshire University
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
system colleges I'm happy to take
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you uh my first question is
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me the pro what role
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
a voucher and a ticket play in historic
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
horse racing sure absolutely so when you
 
04:59:48.670 --> 04:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
when you play and you put your money
 
04:59:49.948 --> 04:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
into the machine and you play the
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
machine and at the end you end up with a
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
total that's left over so say I put 20
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
bucks in I end up losing 18 of it right
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
and I have $2 left when you're done you
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
hit your cash out and you get a little
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
slip for $2 which you would then have to
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
take to the cash cage and turn that in
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
for $2 a lot of people don't do that um
 
05:00:08.548 --> 05:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
if it's not worth the effort for a $2
 
05:00:10.350 --> 05:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
ticket they won't bother to do it um
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example I have a I have
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
a sports betting ticket that I did the
 
05:00:15.070 --> 05:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
day sports betting opened here in New
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I still haven't cashed it
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
in that was in
 
05:00:19.708 --> 05:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
2019 um so it's not uncommon if you only
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
win a little bit of money that you may
 
05:00:23.310 --> 05:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
not go cash that voucher in but on the
 
05:00:25.868 --> 05:00:25.878 align:start position:0%
end it's 200 Grand in aggregate across
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state and rather than having the
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
operators have them sit on that
 
05:00:31.230 --> 05:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
liability for two years and then turn
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
that liability to the state who then
 
05:00:34.990 --> 05:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
sits on that liability for two years
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
instead what we're saying is the
 
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
operators will sit on it for one year
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
and then on July 1st of every year
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
they'll submit a report to the to the
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission saying here's all the
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
tickets here's the total amount of money
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
and here's a check for that total amount
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
of money um and then Lottery could then
 
05:00:52.750 --> 05:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
deposit those funds into the governor
 
05:00:52.760 --> 05:00:54.390 align:start position:0%
deposit those funds into the governor
scholarship

05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
fund I had a follow question and I still
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand is that a voucher they
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
call I think they call it a voucher it's
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
a slip of M it's a ticket that they get
 
05:01:06.350 --> 05:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
from the machine that's printed I'm not
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what the title is words
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry they're equivalent words
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
ticket andou yeah ticket and voucher
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
same thing they get a ticket from the
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
machine or voucher from the machine that
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
says this is basically your winnings it
 
05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
could be you know you could have 23
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
cents left or you could have more money
 
05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
than that and and the other qu the the
 
05:01:31.708 --> 05:01:31.718 align:start position:0%
pro real question was on the fiscal note
 
05:01:35.548 --> 05:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
says that this four of this
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
400,000 200,000 of it is going to the
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship fund and 200 of
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
it is going to the horse R historic
 
05:01:49.230 --> 05:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
operators so again that's because of the
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
amended compens because we have the
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
mistake in there once she fix that
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
mistake all $400,000 go to the the
 
05:01:59.230 --> 05:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship fund when you fix
 
05:02:00.990 --> 05:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
those two errors adding back historic
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
horse racing and changing that language
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
onine 14 we'll need to there's
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
someone John yeah I'm sure John will be
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
happy to Mr be happy to speak
 
05:02:14.350 --> 05:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes if you were rever
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
clerk you wouldn't speak as fast as you
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
do repeat slowly the two in all fairness
 
05:02:22.510 --> 05:02:22.520 align:start position:0%

05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
back in where says or historic horse
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
racing so put that line that struck out
 
05:02:38.110 --> 05:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
put it back
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
in okay line four and then on line
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
sorry okay and then on line 14 there's
 
05:02:57.390 --> 05:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
an undefined term where it says horse
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
racing gaming operators need to strike
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
that and replace it with um
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
any person Association or Corporation
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
Association that's a word I was missing
 
05:03:12.270 --> 05:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
now a follow on question Mr chair Y what
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
is the governor scholarship fund so the
 
05:03:16.548 --> 05:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship fund was created I
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
think in 2020 I don't remember exactly
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
when it was created it might have been
 
05:03:24.190 --> 05:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
2018 or 19 um and the governor
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund is a a college
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund for the Hampshire
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
graduates and it's for firsttime
 
05:03:33.628 --> 05:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
students um to pay their wish to attend
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.548 --> 05:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
College whether it's public or private I
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
believe in New Hampshire representative
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
Bolton so U thank you Mr chair so I was
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
just wondering how long is that voucher
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
good for can you cash in your 2019
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
voucher or is it dead when you leave the
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
well so because of our statute which is
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
a two-year cycle my money's dead is gone
 
05:03:57.390 --> 05:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
um because every two years unclaimed
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
money unclaimed properties are turned
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
back into the Secretary of State um so
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
that voucher is no good under this stat
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
you the the uh gaming operators would
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would let people know that you
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
have 12 months to collect your money
 
05:04:12.030 --> 05:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
after that it's gone okay all
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.948 --> 05:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
Ames I'm checking myself here am I right
 
05:04:24.670 --> 05:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
in thinking that if you or if we um
 
05:04:24.680 --> 05:04:26.030 align:start position:0%
in thinking that if you or if we um
amended

05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:04:30.990 --> 05:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
out the sentence that
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
sends sends the money to the governor's
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund if we deleted that
 
05:04:41.310 --> 05:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
sentence that the uh the result then
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
would be that the the money would flow
 
05:04:47.948 --> 05:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
into the ETF the education trust fund
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
this Lottery
 
05:04:51.868 --> 05:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
revenues I honestly don't know the
 
05:04:53.310 --> 05:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
answer to that question Lottery May
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
answer be able to answer that uh it may
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
go to the education trust fund um it's a
 
05:05:00.868 --> 05:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
weird depends on the definition of
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
gaming stuff so we'll check
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately yeah so um behind you
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
again our goal was we know that you know
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard the story all along about
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
student debt right and so this is a way
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
of of helping the Hampshire students get
 
05:05:16.270 --> 05:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
a leg up in in their in their work is by
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
supporting that fund and allowing for
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
tuition to be paid then that's that much
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
less in student debt they'll have when
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
they come out of college I'll just in
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
response I'll just say that I totally
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
agree that's a real need so is the uh
 
05:05:33.868 --> 05:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
need to meet the OB obligations to
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
public schools so we've got as with the
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
lots of things we do lots of needs and
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
limited money just I'm just not sure
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
because it's unclaimed money where that
 
05:05:46.270 --> 05:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
money would end up because our statute
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
for unclaimed money is completely
 
05:05:49.548 --> 05:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
different than everything else yeah and
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
so right now all unclaimed money goes to
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
the general fund so if it falls under
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
that process it goes to the general fund
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that it would ever make
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
it to the education trust fund we'll
 
05:06:01.548 --> 05:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
find out that's a
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
probably question
 
05:06:08.190 --> 05:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
follows um I'm just trying to follow the
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
um track of what happens so I I think
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
that the um the
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
operator looks at um when he gets to the
 
05:06:23.230 --> 05:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
end of our one of our bium which is the
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
end of June that's when they figure out
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
the tickets that were unclaimed and they
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
send them to the state and the state
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
hangs on to them for about a year and if
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
nobody makes a claim on them then that's
 
05:06:38.110 --> 05:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
when it goes into the fund is that
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
correct so it's if I'm not mistaken it's
 
05:06:41.788 --> 05:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
two years and two years so it be a total
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
of four years before the money would hit
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
the general oh because it's is it the
 
05:06:47.788 --> 05:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
operator holds it for two years and then
 
05:06:50.430 --> 05:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
the by our unclaimed money statutes
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
another 24 months I believe you have to
 
05:06:53.868 --> 05:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
hold the treasurer has to hold it on top
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
of once it receives it it then and be
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
honestly it also means that the
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer has to advertise I don't know
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
how you adverti for a 23 Cent ticket you
 
05:07:03.070 --> 05:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
know voucher
 
05:07:05.548 --> 05:07:05.558 align:start position:0%
and how much money that costs to to for
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
advertising because like now they would
 
05:07:09.390 --> 05:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
have to quantify all of that on their
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
website the goal was to make it
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
streamline the treasures office and
 
05:07:14.590 --> 05:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
streamline this process and support our
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
college students so our grades follow up
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
so um is the first sentence the one
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's on line three that says on or
 
05:07:25.868 --> 05:07:25.878 align:start position:0%
before July 31
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
I how does it how does that relate to
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
the July one so I think it's to allow
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
them that so on July 1
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I don't know
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
the answer to that sorry maybe John can
 
05:07:43.708 --> 05:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
answer that we may have to change that
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
January one to July one as well they
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
both say submit money yeah to so I think
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
it was the intention was to have it be
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.680 --> 05:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
say

05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay that may need
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
investigation where was elme do you have
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
question or
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
sorry and I'll be happy to put together
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
a basic Amendment for you so you don't
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
get I hate bringing a bill in and make
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody do my work so I don't mind
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
doing the works it's my fault one of us
 
05:08:17.788 --> 05:08:17.798 align:start position:0%
will have the sponsor be happy to if you
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
do the work okay actually that's
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
that I think when it goes house to
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
Senate it does because when I submit it
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
has to be a House member that supports
 
05:08:31.878 --> 05:08:34.390 align:start position:0%
has to be a House member that supports
yeah

05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
okay before house ways and means it's a
 
05:08:38.830 --> 05:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%

Lottery and Valerie King also with New
 
05:09:25.558 --> 05:09:26.628 align:start position:0%
Lottery and Valerie King also with New
Hampshire

05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
lottery so I think I can answer a couple
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions that came up um with
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
respect to to this um uh we can work
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
with uh Senator uh Lang and
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative PL you're correct that uh
 
05:09:43.708 --> 05:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to uh we're trying to
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
correct a an already confusing process
 
05:09:48.548 --> 05:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
in statute and I think we have
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
conflicting dates in there so um we'll
 
05:09:53.230 --> 05:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
work with Senator Lang uh to make sure
 
05:09:54.670 --> 05:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
that we get some clarification on that
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
January 31 date so that it all flows
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
together in one way um with respect to
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
the funds um there is a it's stated in
 
05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
the law that the These funds do flow
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
into R 284 21j from the um Treasurer's
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
Office 28421 J I believe if I'm not
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
mistaken is uh the Lottery Commission
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
fund which then flows into the education
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund after um after our expenses
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
are paid um so that money that is the
 
05:10:28.548 --> 05:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
the uh I can confirm that for you
 
05:10:30.430 --> 05:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative Ames but I believe that's
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
flows follow I'm not sure I understood
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that
 
05:10:42.160 --> 05:10:44.470 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that
currently

05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of what's described here
 
05:10:52.110 --> 05:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
is flowing into the education trust fund
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
it is and just currently historic course
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
racing has not met uh as Senator Lang
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
indicated there's a long lag time for
 
05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
unclaimed funds so we haven't actually
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
had historic horse racing unclaimed
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds uh come through yet um but
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
currently for horse racing simal cast uh
 
05:11:14.350 --> 05:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
racing um those unclaimed monies get
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
dist get uh paid to the treasurer's
 
05:11:19.868 --> 05:11:19.878 align:start position:0%
office any claims that come in they get
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
paid out of that and anything that's
 
05:11:25.230 --> 05:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
left over is uh is part of the special
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
fund under RC 28421 J that is the
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
lottery commissions fund that then um
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
then funds education the education trust
 
05:11:39.190 --> 05:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
fund after our expenses are paid yeah so
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure the Constitutional provision
 
05:11:45.760 --> 05:11:47.270 align:start position:0%
sure the Constitutional provision
requires

05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
requires
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
that Lottery revenues from the state run
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
Lottery which I presume includes what
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here um must go to
 
05:12:01.628 --> 05:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
uh be used exclusively for the purpose
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
of State a to
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
education um and also refers to the
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
school districts of the state so I'm
 
05:12:11.788 --> 05:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you can actually do
 
05:12:15.628 --> 05:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
this so representative Ames I I that's a
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
complicated legal question I do I would
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
just flag for you that uh traditionally
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
Lottery and racing were separate uh
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
commissions um and so um the restriction
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
on lottery funds um I believe make carry
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
only with the lottery games um whereas
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
the gaming which is now overseen by um
 
05:12:41.628 --> 05:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
by The Lottery Commission uh I'm not
 
05:12:43.868 --> 05:12:43.878 align:start position:0%
sure if that's subject to the same uh
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional restriction we would have
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
to check with the Department of Justice
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
to confirm that aren't you advertising
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
that your Reven revenues are going into
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
education we do
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes um well I I urge that you ask that
 
05:13:01.628 --> 05:13:01.638 align:start position:0%
you and perhaps we should independently
 
05:13:01.638 --> 05:13:02.670 align:start position:0%
you and perhaps we should independently
ask

05:13:02.670 --> 05:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
ask
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
for advice on this from the attorney
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
general because there may be a
 
05:13:05.680 --> 05:13:08.868 align:start position:0%
general because there may be a
constitutional

05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.990 --> 05:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
conflict we can do that represent
 
05:13:13.000 --> 05:13:16.990 align:start position:0%
conflict we can do that represent
Ames

05:13:16.990 --> 05:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative two questions now on
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
one I take it that if the racing is
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
considered separate for this purpose we
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
would have to take the sentence on lines
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
text um not I I don't know necessarily
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
whether that would have to be removed
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
again there have been other payments
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
that have been made out of that fund
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
that have not been specific uh to um
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
that have been considered expenses of
 
05:14:02.548 --> 05:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
um so the the distribution to the
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
governor's um the governor scholarship
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
fund may be considered a expense to the
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
commission as
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
well um that's been done with Kino funds
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
that were um that were um set aside for
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.160 --> 05:14:27.150 align:start position:0%
 
past

05:14:27.150 --> 05:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
the it was much more closely
 
05:14:30.798 --> 05:14:34.110 align:start position:0%
the it was much more closely
linked

05:14:34.110 --> 05:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh my other question is this one about
 
05:14:41.110 --> 05:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
tickets and vouchers which appear in the
 
05:14:44.350 --> 05:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
existing language as well as in the new
 
05:14:44.360 --> 05:14:46.030 align:start position:0%
existing language as well as in the new
language

05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
and what is the difference between a
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
ticket and a voucher a ticket is the
 
05:14:56.110 --> 05:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
original betting ticket that one gets um
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
so if you are going to uh bet on the
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Derby when you put your um bet
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
in you would get a ticket back that
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
would um say what your bet is um a
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
voucher is as Senator Lang indicated a
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
um uh is money owed to you uh usually
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
from a machine um that comes out so for
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
example with historic course racing
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
there are no real tickets they are all
 
05:15:27.070 --> 05:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
vouchers um you would put your $20 or
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
$10 into a machine you play um and then
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
when you're done playing you cash out
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
and what you cash out is a is a is a
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
voucher um so that's payable um upon um
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
upon presentation uh at the facility at
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
either an a different machine or with
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
your with the
 
05:15:52.750 --> 05:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
much I have no more pink cards um is
 
05:16:01.990 --> 05:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who would like to tell
 
05:16:04.830 --> 05:16:04.840 align:start position:0%

473 okay we'll now open the public
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%

05:16:34.548 --> 05:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.948 --> 05:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you Senator Lang for
 
05:16:40.110 --> 05:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
filling in for me I'm Grant bossy uh
 
05:16:42.270 --> 05:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
here to introduce Senate Bill 361 on
 
05:16:44.350 --> 05:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Bradley the Bill's
 
05:16:47.948 --> 05:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor sp sp 497 FN creates a
 
05:16:50.670 --> 05:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
non-aps dedicated account for the
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
disperate share hospital or dish fund
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
having a separate account will allow the
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
to distribute the funds more efficiently
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
the Senators uh excuse me the C for
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services require
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
that the share exam be completed each
 
05:17:08.350 --> 05:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to determine the amount of
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
dish money for each Hospital excess
 
05:17:13.230 --> 05:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
funds are redistributed to the hospitals
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
in a manner laid out by the State
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan the dish fund would only
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
receive dish payments from the hospitals
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
and will only pay out funds to the
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals making the process cost
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
neutral to the state if you have any
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator Bradley I will try
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
to get you an answer uh thank you again
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to bring in this bill
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
for Senator Brenton thank you
 
05:17:34.558 --> 05:17:35.910 align:start position:0%
for Senator Brenton thank you
representative

05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you I have never heard the
 
05:17:43.990 --> 05:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
word examinations used in quite this way
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
before and presumably it is um an a
 
05:17:51.548 --> 05:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal audit of the
 
05:17:51.558 --> 05:17:53.628 align:start position:0%
fiscal audit of the
hospitals

05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
05:17:57.390 --> 05:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
and given that on what's the flow of the
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
money the it sounds like maybe
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are requested to provide
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
money for these examinations that goes
 
05:18:14.270 --> 05:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
into this fund and then they figure out
 
05:18:18.670 --> 05:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
how much each Hospital owes or is owed
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
and distribute the money that way but it
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through this fund is that
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at rather than me
 
05:18:28.350 --> 05:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
going from memory on the history of the
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
me in the dish I would recommend uh
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
asking that of the Department of Health
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and is are you they
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
are coming okay good because my
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of these things is about
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
examinations representative PL I have no
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
idea what we're talking about what's a
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share again I think I
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
think the department will be be able to
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
better address uh this program it's it's
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
designed uh to help uh New Hampshire
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh that need a little more
 
05:19:09.150 --> 05:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
help in providing care to New
 
05:19:11.070 --> 05:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's most needy populations I
 
05:19:12.510 --> 05:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
would defer the department to walk you
 
05:19:15.390 --> 05:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
through the entire dish program sounds
 
05:19:20.430 --> 05:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
for okay so we will therefore invite up
 
05:19:26.708 --> 05:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
Robert Barry from New Hampshire DHHS who
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
can hopefully clarify some of these
 
05:19:30.360 --> 05:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
can hopefully clarify some of these
questions

05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
so um for the record Robert Barry um
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
general counsel to the division of
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh for the New Hampshire
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:19:44.948 --> 05:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
um the dish program is um if you wanted
 
05:19:46.990 --> 05:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
to have a full picture of it it would
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
take probably four or five hours and
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
three or four more people than me uh to
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
go through it but this is a really
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
simple Bill uh what I can I'll give you
 
05:20:00.030 --> 05:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
the the general flow of how dish works
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that'll alleviate um any
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions about this but
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
essentially um dish is paid out uh for
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh hospitals what they're what's called
 
05:20:14.548 --> 05:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care uh and this is for uh
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals that serve uh uninsured
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
individuals or a large number of
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid individuals it's um it's funds
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
that flow to it uh to each Hospital uh
 
05:20:28.510 --> 05:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
in May of every year and it's paid uh
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
for through the um Medicaid enhancement
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
tax um so the initial Dish payment what
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
we call the interm payment um is paid
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
out uh in one year we'll say 2020 for
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
instance then there is a dish
 
05:20:48.990 --> 05:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
examination that occurs three years
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
later and representative all me you're
 
05:20:54.750 --> 05:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
right it's uh it's a financial audit um
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
each Hospital submits their um their
 
05:21:01.948 --> 05:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care uh cop cost for the
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
year in question to our external uh
 
05:21:08.190 --> 05:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
auditing entity Myers and staer uh and
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
they determine what the actual
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care was for the hospital
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
for that given year um that usually
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
happens uh 3 years after the initial
 
05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
payment is done so um in 2023 we just
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
got the results of 2020 this year we'll
 
05:21:25.910 --> 05:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
just get we'll get 2021 so when that
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
happens when we get those results back
 
05:21:30.750 --> 05:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
we have to reconcile the amounts that
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
were paid paid so it's a finite pool of
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
money but some hospitals will have to
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
pay into the fund and other hospitals
 
05:21:39.628 --> 05:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
will receive the funds from the
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are payers so there will
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
be payers and receivers in the end the
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
state ends up in a net zero balance uh
 
05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
but it's just a way to redistribute the
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
funds and what this serves to do is to
 
05:21:55.470 --> 05:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
make it uh efficient and um and uh easy
 
05:21:57.150 --> 05:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
for the Department to administer this
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
redistribution process which we're
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
obligated to do under federal law
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:22:04.520 --> 05:22:06.708 align:start position:0%
okay thank
you

05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
Ames it uh my understanding of this is
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
that this is an important um provision
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
that is needed the powers that that be
 
05:22:24.110 --> 05:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
or the knowledgeable people say and I
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
take that as gospel and uh that passing
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
this will enable uh sort of seamlessly
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
the process to continue yes you're
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
correct representative uh this was
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
Department requested legislation um so
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're grateful to the senator for uh
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill uh we felt it was
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
very important uh from a uh a process
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint to accomplish what we have to
 
05:22:48.040 --> 05:22:53.070 align:start position:0%
standpoint to accomplish what we have to
federally

05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.190 --> 05:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
do yes representative Bolton thank you
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so um we have a
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
couple of for-profit hospitals in New
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do they qualify for for Dish
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:23:07.390 --> 05:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
or definitely I believe every hospital
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
qualifies yeah I we we pay out to around
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
24 right now um I don't know what the
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
full number of hospitals in New
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is but I think they're 26
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
actually it might be 20 it's in that
 
05:23:23.628 --> 05:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
that uh that range I count them up
 
05:23:25.390 --> 05:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
occasionally and then I forget the
 
05:23:29.230 --> 05:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
number but uh it's in the 20s okay I
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
think I answer thank you
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes R and Ali yes um this part I don't
 
05:23:39.628 --> 05:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
remember at all on they get a prepayment
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
three years before three years before
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.990 --> 05:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
it we didn't start by giving them money
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
for three
 
05:23:59.070 --> 05:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
years how did this thing work out to the
 
05:24:01.150 --> 05:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
point where where does where did the
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
money that started this so you want to
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
go back to
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
200 I guess fiveish when we got rid of
 
05:24:11.708 --> 05:24:11.718 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid
 
05:24:15.708 --> 05:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
um on the scam game that we were
 
05:24:15.718 --> 05:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
um on the scam game that we were
playing

05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
playing
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh we were getting double back from from
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
the feds and they finally decided they
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do that anymore
 
05:24:35.948 --> 05:24:35.958 align:start position:0%
um of what the um Hospital Aid
 
05:24:35.958 --> 05:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
um of what the um Hospital Aid
was

05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
and and I guess we might have started
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
with with some of that money because I
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
remember it was painful but not that
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
painful I think you're getting into some
 
05:24:56.110 --> 05:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
history that I may not be aware of I've
 
05:24:58.990 --> 05:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
been uh involved in the dish program for
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
about 2 years now and
 
05:25:05.230 --> 05:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
um and like I said it it there's a team
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
of people uh when I say there's a dish
 
05:25:10.270 --> 05:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
team there is a team of people and also
 
05:25:13.230 --> 05:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
involves many outside Consultants uh so
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
to the extent this history goes back
 
05:25:17.470 --> 05:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
much further than than that I'm probably
 
05:25:19.510 --> 05:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be directly aware of it but
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge um we've been paying the
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
interim payments with uh met revenue for
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
at least a decade probably more than
 
05:25:34.830 --> 05:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
that that um and we base the interim
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
payment on uncompensated care from two
 
05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
years prior to the the the date in
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
question so this year we're doing 24
 
05:25:49.390 --> 05:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
payments will be based on 22 data um and
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
then it'll in three years they'll be
 
05:25:52.788 --> 05:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
audited so the numbers are never going
 
05:25:55.310 --> 05:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
to quite match up um but that's how we
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.718 --> 05:26:01.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:26:01.548 --> 05:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you Mr
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair so you've got two different you
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
have one existing fund already the the
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
338 and you want to create a new
 
05:26:22.000 --> 05:26:25.628 align:start position:0%
338 and you want to create a new
one

05:26:25.628 --> 05:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.638 --> 05:26:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
yes oh so my of section one is it's
 
05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
creating a new it's making a reference
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the paragraph one the new paragraph
 
05:26:35.920 --> 05:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
to the paragraph one the new paragraph
one

05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.350 --> 05:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
sorry maybe that part doesn't matter so
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
my my question is I I think you have one
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
one um fund now and you want two funds
 
05:27:03.628 --> 05:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
is that because one is for the money
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
that flows in from
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the other one is for money
 
05:27:15.548 --> 05:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
going out to the hospitals so one in I'm
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
not fully sure about this but one might
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
be just for the receipt of the Met
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue I don't know that for a fact but
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that could be one and then the
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
second one is just for the
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
redistribution process so that's money
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
we receive from the
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh the paying hospitals and
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
then we turn around and immediately push
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
it out to the receiving hospitals for um
 
05:27:40.910 --> 05:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
um for the redistribution process so
 
05:27:43.070 --> 05:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's two different processes going on
 
05:27:46.590 --> 05:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
here the redistribution process is not
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.150 --> 05:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
process representative PL oh I'm sorry
 
05:27:58.830 --> 05:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
follow yeah so my point being
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
was it may make sure that the titles
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
make it clear what what that fund is for
 
05:28:09.788 --> 05:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
because um representative Al May and I
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
just were looking at another
 
05:28:14.670 --> 05:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
Department's fund funds and we couldn't
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
tell by the title what they were so that
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
it it looks
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
like maybe if you put the
 
05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
word it says deposited but you're
 
05:28:27.868 --> 05:28:27.878 align:start position:0%
telling me it's redistribution maybe you
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
should use the word redistribution
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
online if that's an in and out account
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
because it says deposit so what I'll do
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
is I'll go back and check with the
 
05:28:37.548 --> 05:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
finance folks because they're the ones
 
05:28:39.310 --> 05:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
that helped out with this legislation I
 
05:28:42.750 --> 05:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not a finance wizard um I'm just a
 
05:28:42.760 --> 05:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
I'm not a finance wizard um I'm just a
mere

05:28:47.390 --> 05:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.548 --> 05:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
attorney representative PL I'm sorry and
 
05:28:52.190 --> 05:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
then represent me yes you used an acrom
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
dish yes I want to make certain I
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the acronym stands or is
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
it disproportionate Hospital
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share Hospital okay and
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
not Department of Health and Human
 
05:29:04.110 --> 05:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
Services no that's the
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
HHS representative
 
05:29:10.350 --> 05:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
eling thank you um I
 
05:29:15.150 --> 05:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
found f on section three
 
05:29:19.628 --> 05:29:19.638 align:start position:0%
confusing on in that it was
 
05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
clear that it was going
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
to take all disproportionate Hospital
 
05:29:30.030 --> 05:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
share hospital um Revenue received to be
 
05:29:32.110 --> 05:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
credited to the
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
then it talked about this
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share
 
05:29:47.070 --> 05:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
examinations on and the fiscal note
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
seemed to talk about using this fund to
 
05:29:53.310 --> 05:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
pay for these
 
05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
examinations no it doesn't pay for the
 
05:29:59.190 --> 05:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
examinations um it's a result of the
 
05:30:01.948 --> 05:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
findings of an examin
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason why we use the term
 
05:30:04.670 --> 05:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
examination because that's the federal
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
language um but it does equate to an
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
audit okay so this fund is really just
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
the monies that came in from Medicaid
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:30:20.270 --> 05:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the money that the
 
05:30:23.708 --> 05:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals sent
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
back to the state it's the money they
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
sent yeah it's the money they sent back
 
05:30:31.750 --> 05:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of the findings of the
 
05:30:35.390 --> 05:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
examination and then we take that uh
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
those funds and then we have to
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
redistribute it out to uh hospitals that
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
were not uh paid as much as they should
 
05:30:43.948 --> 05:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
have been so it's a zero some game in
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
that sense that nothing remains in in
 
05:30:49.548 --> 05:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
the fund it all goes right back out and
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
and somewhere
 
05:30:56.350 --> 05:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
in in the statutes there is something
 
05:30:59.948 --> 05:30:59.958 align:start position:0%
that explains how the examinations were
 
05:31:02.590 --> 05:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
done and paid
 
05:31:06.190 --> 05:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
for it I don't know if it goes into That
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
explicit of detail but the examinations
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
are required by federal law um so uh not
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
done by federal law what but they are
 
05:31:17.708 --> 05:31:17.718 align:start position:0%
not done by the feds no no it's done by
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
an independent uh entity Myers and staer
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh we we have to pay for them yes so we
 
05:31:25.868 --> 05:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
pay for them um and we're required to
 
05:31:28.030 --> 05:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
have an independent entity do it so um
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
every year we work with Myers and
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
staford to provide them with the
 
05:31:32.548 --> 05:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
information they request of us they
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
reach out to the hospitals individually
 
05:31:37.868 --> 05:31:37.878 align:start position:0%
and then come December of every year uh
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
they provide us the results of the um of
 
05:31:44.670 --> 05:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
the examination going back three years
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.070 --> 05:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
CMS interes yeah
 
05:31:58.030 --> 05:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if um the languages
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be tweaked in in at line
 
05:32:01.760 --> 05:32:02.830 align:start position:0%
needs to be tweaked in in at line
[Music]

05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
15 um
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
where the sentence is saying that the
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
money and the fund is there for the
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
purpose of redistributing
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share Hospital funds
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
between and among hospitals and then it
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
says for completion of the federally
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
required disproportionate share Hospital
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
examinations does that mean in
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
compliance with instead it for
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
completion of is confusing language okay
 
05:32:36.750 --> 05:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's to effectuate what the feds
 
05:32:39.910 --> 05:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
require which is for us to redistribute
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the funds in accordance with our
 
05:32:44.548 --> 05:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
state plan after an examination has been
 
05:32:47.230 --> 05:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh completed um maybe you could check on
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
that and if if better wording like what
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
I suggested in compliance with sure
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
would better effectuate the purpose and
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
make it clearer okay um then it's easily
 
05:33:02.110 --> 05:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
changed at this point in the game it
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
won't be easily changed much later no
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:13.150 --> 05:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
clear anything else one more do you know
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening right now is it are is
 
05:33:17.948 --> 05:33:17.958 align:start position:0%
it all going in and out of one fund the
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
one we had to get a fund established
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee and my
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is we have to do that
 
05:33:25.230 --> 05:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
every year which is why we're hoping to
 
05:33:27.750 --> 05:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
do it through the statute to to make it
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit more efficient right now
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of of
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
redistributing um for years 11 through
 
05:33:38.190 --> 05:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
17 and uh we um we've just completed our
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
second payments uh for that so we had a
 
05:33:43.830 --> 05:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
a quarterly um redistribution collection
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
and then as soon as we collect from the
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
owing hospitals we send it right back
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
out to the uh receiving hospitals so we
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
held on to the money for I think a week
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
tops okay thank you very
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%

members of the committee I remain Grant
 
05:34:33.070 --> 05:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
bossy here to
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
introduce um Senate Bill 513 on behalf
 
05:34:40.070 --> 05:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
of Senator Ganon the prime sponsor this
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill would permit charity auctions by
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporations Senator Ganon not
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
being an expert on auctions called in a
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
ringer to help him and that's former
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Harold French uh Senator French
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers for charitable organizations
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
to conduct auctions and he explained to
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon that he as the auctioneer
 
05:34:59.948 --> 05:34:59.958 align:start position:0%
has no control over the items or the ad
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
advertising no custody of the money or
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds he just does the job as an
 
05:35:06.350 --> 05:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer this bill would allow a
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporation to conduct an
 
05:35:10.510 --> 05:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
auction using an Auctioneer like Senator
 
05:35:12.548 --> 05:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
French this bill would make the code
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
easier than it is presently in committee
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald offered a friendly
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify that there must be
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
a charitable purpose for such an auction
 
05:35:22.750 --> 05:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you have any questions for Senator
 
05:35:24.750 --> 05:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
Ganon I'd be happy to get you an answer
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh since this bill passed the Senate we
 
05:35:30.070 --> 05:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
did receive an email from uh Michael
 
05:35:31.628 --> 05:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
Haley he's the acting director of the
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit he has a concern
 
05:35:35.390 --> 05:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
with the current
 
05:35:39.150 --> 05:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
language um in the bill uh the
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
definition of a charitable organization
 
05:35:47.230 --> 05:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
as eligible under RSA 7 uh
 
05:35:51.070 --> 05:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
212b uh would currently exclude
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that was not the
 
05:35:54.990 --> 05:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill so there may need to
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
be a tweak to the language to include
 
05:35:58.830 --> 05:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
all sorts of charitable organizations
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
including religious ones uh if you have
 
05:36:03.390 --> 05:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
a question on that or would like some
 
05:36:05.470 --> 05:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
help getting that language together I'm
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
sure Senator Ganon would be happy to
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
help you again I am not an expert on
 
05:36:11.110 --> 05:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
this bill but if you have questions I
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
can get them to Senator Ganon or I can
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
defer to some other people uh preferably
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the Department okay thank you
 
05:36:19.750 --> 05:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative omy followed by
 
05:36:19.760 --> 05:36:21.230 align:start position:0%
representative omy followed by
representative

05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:25.788 --> 05:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
fellows yes on could we get in Michael
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
Haley of the charitable
 
05:36:28.840 --> 05:36:31.708 align:start position:0%
Haley of the charitable
Trust

05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
Trust
 
05:36:35.628 --> 05:36:35.638 align:start position:0%
to discuss this since it's his concern
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a very confusing part of
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
Statute that we were going to clean up
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
about five six years ago and nobody I
 
05:36:47.150 --> 05:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
guess the person who was most concerned
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
didn't run again or
 
05:36:53.590 --> 05:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
something that is uh all of the
 
05:36:58.750 --> 05:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
Charities that aren't
 
05:36:58.760 --> 05:37:01.670 align:start position:0%
Charities that aren't
c3s

05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
c3s
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
but that are listed in another section
 
05:37:07.708 --> 05:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
of our Charities as being okay yeah this
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with auctioneers and
 
05:37:12.030 --> 05:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
then by reference it gets into that
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
Thicket of non for-profit organizations
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
and I think uh the reference was not
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
been represented
 
05:37:27.868 --> 05:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
fellow thank you I I'm just wondering if
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that actually belongs
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
bels under the Licensing Laws because I
 
05:37:36.030 --> 05:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
believe an Auctioneer has to be
 
05:37:40.510 --> 05:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
licensed and if that's the case then
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be in there that you that
 
05:37:44.430 --> 05:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
you would put an
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
exception for a
 
05:37:52.390 --> 05:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
charity I think the idea was not to uh
 
05:37:53.948 --> 05:37:53.958 align:start position:0%
again I can look into this a little
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
further but the idea wasn't to alter the
 
05:37:57.868 --> 05:37:57.878 align:start position:0%
auctioneer's license you would still be
 
05:38:01.708 --> 05:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
a licensed auctioneer but the current
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
RSA um basically makes the auctioneer
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for the goods being off
 
05:38:10.628 --> 05:38:10.638 align:start position:0%
auctioned and in these charity auctions
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
the auctioneer doesn't own doesn't
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
control doesn't have anything to do
 
05:38:16.470 --> 05:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're just providing the service of
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
the transaction itself so they didn't
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be appropriate for the
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
auctioneer to face the same liability
 
05:38:24.868 --> 05:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
for the products as if say they're
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
auctioning off their own thing their
 
05:38:29.390 --> 05:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
their own products or holding their own
 
05:38:29.400 --> 05:38:30.708 align:start position:0%
their own products or holding their own
auction

05:38:30.708 --> 05:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
auction
 
05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
auction they would still have to be a
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
licensed auction here to perform the
 
05:38:38.350 --> 05:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
service yeah follow up yeah my my if I'm
 
05:38:41.548 --> 05:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
wondering if whoever got put this bill
 
05:38:43.788 --> 05:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
together had some kind of conversation
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
with Edna I just didn't want to put
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
something in you know if there's
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
licensing Auctioneer licensing statutes
 
05:38:53.310 --> 05:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
in one RSA I didn't want to put
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
something that contradicts that in a
 
05:38:55.360 --> 05:38:58.548 align:start position:0%
something that contradicts that in a
different

05:38:58.548 --> 05:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.558 --> 05:39:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
RSA

05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:04.990 --> 05:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:39:07.948 --> 05:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
almond there is uh put your microphone
 
05:39:12.430 --> 05:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
on please yeah on
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
311b um there's a state board of
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
auctioneers you'd think that they would
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
have been pulled into
 
05:39:21.600 --> 05:39:25.150 align:start position:0%
have been pulled into
oplc

05:39:25.150 --> 05:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
um it's a fairly long
 
05:39:28.558 --> 05:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
um it's a fairly long
statute

05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
through Rob
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
Senator yes I'm referring
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
to lines nine and 10 the auctioner shall
 
05:39:45.670 --> 05:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
not receive any commission from sales or
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
a percentage of the revenues as
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
compensation is did you expect the
 
05:39:51.270 --> 05:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
auction to do it for nothing or is there
 
05:39:53.270 --> 05:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
flat fee possible or what yeah it'd be a
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
fee for service rather than a cut of the
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
proceeds therefore they wouldn't be
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for the items being
 
05:40:02.110 --> 05:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
auctioned themselves they'd just be
 
05:40:04.350 --> 05:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
performing the service of an Auctioneer
 
05:40:06.750 --> 05:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
to to run the auction in a a competent
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
and trustworthy manner uh without the
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
same liability that we put on them for
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
stuff representative just an update on
 
05:40:19.280 --> 05:40:20.788 align:start position:0%
stuff representative just an update on
Section

05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
Section
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
B3 does on say that they need the
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
approval of the executive director of
 
05:40:28.990 --> 05:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
The Office of profession professional
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
licens and certification so presumably
 
05:40:36.030 --> 05:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:36.040 --> 05:40:37.708 align:start position:0%
 
oplc

05:40:37.708 --> 05:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative so I have a question for
 
05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
you do you think that this bill was
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
us um I don't make that determination
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
the speaker sent it into us okay but I
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
might say it's about
 
05:40:56.280 --> 05:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
might say it's about
charitable

05:40:58.390 --> 05:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
05:41:02.590 --> 05:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
gaming in a way the the bill as as
 
05:41:05.430 --> 05:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate doesn't adjust
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the auctioneer
 
05:41:08.310 --> 05:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
license auctioneers would still have the
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
same responsibilities this would allow a
 
05:41:13.948 --> 05:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
charitable organization to contract out
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
for an Auctioneer without to to allow
 
05:41:19.070 --> 05:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
the auctioneer as representative CL said
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
to do a fee for service rather than
 
05:41:23.788 --> 05:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
basically run the whole auction and be
 
05:41:26.030 --> 05:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
financially responsible for the whole
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
thing follow yes so that's exactly my
 
05:41:32.788 --> 05:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
concern because we have for somebody to
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
be called an
 
05:41:37.708 --> 05:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer I I to me it means that they
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a license to be an Auctioneer and I
 
05:41:42.030 --> 05:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
I believe you would still need to be a
 
05:41:43.468 --> 05:41:43.478 align:start position:0%
properly licensed Auctioneer in the
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to perform this
 
05:41:48.430 --> 05:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
service they couldn't just have me do
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
it but it line five says without a
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
license I'm not sure for that
 
05:41:57.788 --> 05:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
organization yeah the the organization
 
05:41:59.548 --> 05:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
would not need to be have an auction
 
05:42:03.430 --> 05:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
license they could hire a licensed
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer to come in and perform that
 
05:42:07.150 --> 05:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
service but it wouldn't be removing them
 
05:42:07.160 --> 05:42:10.030 align:start position:0%
service but it wouldn't be removing them
from

05:42:10.030 --> 05:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
oplc it's more of a liability Bill than
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
it is a li a change to the
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
license representative
 
05:42:19.990 --> 05:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
lle thank you Mr
 
05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
chair I don't understand the need for
 
05:42:22.240 --> 05:42:24.468 align:start position:0%
chair I don't understand the need for
this

05:42:24.468 --> 05:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:42:26.670 --> 05:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
legislation can well I guess the
 
05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
question is is there a need for this
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
legl yes that's my question can you help
 
05:42:31.948 --> 05:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
me understand why we need this
 
05:42:34.750 --> 05:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is it fixing a problem in
 
05:42:38.830 --> 05:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
statute is it fixing I
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'm currently a charitable organization
 
05:42:43.788 --> 05:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
to bring in an Auctioneer to hire them
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
to say we'll pay you this fee to conduct
 
05:42:49.750 --> 05:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
our auction no matter how much we raise
 
05:42:52.430 --> 05:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
um you can do that but then the current
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute then makes that Auctioneer who's
 
05:42:57.150 --> 05:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
just coming in for the day to pound the
 
05:42:58.990 --> 05:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
gavel and speak quickly and get get all
 
05:43:02.910 --> 05:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
the in would have the same liability
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
for everything that church charity
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization is auctioning the
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
auctioneer would be personally liable
 
05:43:14.910 --> 05:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
for everything that's going on there and
 
05:43:17.110 --> 05:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that that makes those auctioneers
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do it it makes it harder
 
05:43:21.030 --> 05:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the Charities uh Senator French felt
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
that this would be a good way to fix
 
05:43:25.708 --> 05:43:25.718 align:start position:0%
it and that's the way it works now when
 
05:43:27.708 --> 05:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
an Auctioneer auctions properties off
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
they're liable for everything yeah yeah
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
there there's there's much
 
05:43:33.628 --> 05:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
steeper um liabilities because they're
 
05:43:35.548 --> 05:43:35.558 align:start position:0%
cond they're licensed by the state to
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
conduct things in a certain way and if
 
05:43:39.628 --> 05:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
there's any sort of fraud or deception
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
or anything like that obviously that's a
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
violation of what they've agreed to do
 
05:43:45.628 --> 05:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:43:49.830 --> 05:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman I tend to
 
05:43:53.920 --> 05:43:55.548 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman I tend to
read

05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
read
 
05:43:59.190 --> 05:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
lines 3 to five as representative
 
05:44:02.350 --> 05:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
fellows does I think I think I'm
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
agreeing with you um
 
05:44:08.910 --> 05:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
that particularly on line five it says
 
05:44:13.110 --> 05:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
that non-member individuals hired can
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
Pro engage in auctioning services for
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
charity auctions without a license to me
 
05:44:21.948 --> 05:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
that phrase without a license doesn't
 
05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
refer to the organization it refers to
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
that represent I don't see how this
 
05:44:38.990 --> 05:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
language in front of us addresses at all
 
05:44:42.030 --> 05:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
the uh auctioneers uh not having
 
05:44:43.750 --> 05:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility because it doesn't say
 
05:44:43.760 --> 05:44:44.468 align:start position:0%
responsibility because it doesn't say
that

05:44:44.468 --> 05:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh so point out where you know
 
05:44:50.708 --> 05:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
how it removes the auctioneer from any
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh obligation the auctioneer would
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise have because it doesn't say
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
anything towards that let me see if we
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
can get some people before you they can
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
answer tell me your questions uh and
 
05:45:04.230 --> 05:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
furthermore shouldn't it say that the
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
when it says the auctioner shall not
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
receive any commission from sales or
 
05:45:09.628 --> 05:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
percentage of the revenues this
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
compensation shouldn't also say but a
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
fee for service may be rendered or
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
something like that uh you you could do
 
05:45:17.990 --> 05:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that if if something isn't prohibited by
 
05:45:20.350 --> 05:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
law it's allowed okay so but you could
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:30.910 --> 05:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
that represent elberger um
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
line uh the contract for auctioneering
 
05:45:36.310 --> 05:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
services shall be in writing that's line
 
05:45:39.310 --> 05:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
five to six and then starting on line
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
eight the contract shall State the
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
auctioneers duties and compensation if
 
05:45:47.868 --> 05:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
any whether monetary or otherwise so
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
this does account for compensation to
 
05:45:50.638 --> 05:45:54.868 align:start position:0%
this does account for compensation to
the

05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
auctioneer it seems to any further
 
05:45:58.320 --> 05:46:00.910 align:start position:0%
auctioneer it seems to any further
questions

05:46:00.910 --> 05:46:00.920 align:start position:0%

05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh one last
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
time I am Grant AI here to introduce
 
05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 514 on behalf of Senator
 
05:47:05.590 --> 05:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
Pearl the prime sponsor and on behalf of
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
all our Senators thank you again for the
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
courtesy of letting staff introduce
 
05:47:10.750 --> 05:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
these bills on their behalf New
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire imposes a normal yield tax of
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
10% on the stumpage value of Timber at
 
05:47:19.390 --> 05:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
the time it's cut which then goes to the
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipality there's an exemption for
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
the first 10,000 board feet for the
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
landowner's own use for construction up
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
to 20 cords of fuel
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh fuel wood per year or the equivalent
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
of wood chips this creates a lot of
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
paperwork and up to a 15-day delay for
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
many small harvesting operations meant
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
for the landowner's property for Which
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
towns get very little Revenue it's also
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
confusion on how to calculate the
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent of 10,000 Bo feet or 20 cords
 
05:47:54.430 --> 05:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
of wood chips s514 increases the
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
personal use exemptions by 50% and
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
cleans up the equivalent Language by
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
replacing it with an exemption of 300
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
tons of whole tree chips as you can see
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal note that would have a
 
05:48:08.270 --> 05:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
negligible impact on local revenues for
 
05:48:10.468 --> 05:48:10.478 align:start position:0%
instance the tax on 10 additional cords
 
05:48:13.110 --> 05:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
of firewood would only be about 10 bucks
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate Ways and Means Committee
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
adopted an amendment that changed the
 
05:48:18.868 --> 05:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
limit on wood chips from 30 tons to 300
 
05:48:20.468 --> 05:48:20.478 align:start position:0%
tons which the sponsors and committee
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
felt was a better equivalent to the
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
board feet limit SP 514 would reduce
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
time and paperwork for land owners
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
harvesting a small number of trees on
 
05:48:30.430 --> 05:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
the their own land and for local
 
05:48:32.750 --> 05:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
officials who are putting a lot of work
 
05:48:34.990 --> 05:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
for very little Revenue Senator Pearl
 
05:48:36.468 --> 05:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
thanks you for your consideration and
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
support of s SP 514 thank
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
you questions representative
 
05:48:48.150 --> 05:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
Aly yes
 
05:48:52.708 --> 05:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
on I'm skeptical of this particularly
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
the last paragraph in which someone can
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
clearcut a whole parcel and and uh we
 
05:49:04.830 --> 05:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
don't 300 tons of whole wood chips
 
05:49:07.030 --> 05:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like an awful lot and these days
 
05:49:10.270 --> 05:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
wood chips go for more
 
05:49:12.548 --> 05:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
um this would be for personal use not
 
05:49:16.510 --> 05:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
for sale this would um no that
 
05:49:20.830 --> 05:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
particular one is convert the use of the
 
05:49:24.430 --> 05:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
land uh after securing building permits
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
subdivision or zoning permits Etc so
 
05:49:31.948 --> 05:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
that's not that's personal business use
 
05:49:34.110 --> 05:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I don't have
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
a which line are you looking at on I'm
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
looking at lines
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
20 uh 3 to
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
26 okay that's existing
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
statute that's not a change in the bill
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
itself and whether the existing
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
statute's correct again that that's for
 
05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
you to decide but it's not it is
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
also multiplying by three it looks like
 
05:50:01.990 --> 05:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
what anybody else can
 
05:50:04.750 --> 05:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
take because you added
 
05:50:08.070 --> 05:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
in you increased the logs you increase
 
05:50:11.230 --> 05:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
the cords I guess I guess it isn't by
 
05:50:15.788 --> 05:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
three but the 300 tons of whole wood
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
chips uh is supposed to be equivalent to
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
30 cords of wood that was the decision
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
the committee made I couldn't I couldn't
 
05:50:27.868 --> 05:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
speak to that well I'm going to want to
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
talk with my essor about this
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
before because the timber tax was
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
created to compensate the towns for the
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
fact that the forests were in current
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
use and that they weren't able to to tax
 
05:50:49.910 --> 05:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
it except at extremely low rates so the
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
idea was when the timber comes off as a
 
05:50:54.990 --> 05:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
product then you tax
 
05:50:59.070 --> 05:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
it so there's something arai either on
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
one end or the other of
 
05:51:05.548 --> 05:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
this in terms of of compensation what
 
05:51:07.390 --> 05:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
what's your question represent El me or
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
is it a would you believe would you
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe well okay I'm staff I don't
 
05:51:11.160 --> 05:51:13.628 align:start position:0%
believe well okay I'm staff I don't
believe

05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.708 --> 05:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
anything uh representative fellows um
 
05:51:20.590 --> 05:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
yes so I I think I'm surprised that
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a fiscal note in here I do
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand that this bill was amended
 
05:51:27.230 --> 05:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I looked up to see how it was
 
05:51:29.788 --> 05:51:29.798 align:start position:0%
amended and the Amendment did just one
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
thing it's in line
 
05:51:36.990 --> 05:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
21 um in where it says and 300 tons
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
right now it initially it said 30 tons
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that's a substantial increase I think
 
05:51:48.310 --> 05:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal impact here on the uh
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities because just the little
 
05:51:57.030 --> 05:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
change that goes from 20 to 30 cords if
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
you you said the tax on a cord was about
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
$10 I believe so let me check that or I
 
05:52:06.190 --> 05:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know the rates you said
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
something yeah 10 additional cords the
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
tax would be about $10 then you think
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
the tax is $1 per cord that's the
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
information I was given well I I think
 
05:52:17.590 --> 05:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
we need more information about like what
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
the rates are because I I do I
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
personally understand what a cord looks
 
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
like but when you get into the board
 
05:52:26.990 --> 05:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
feet I don't know what that is and 300
 
05:52:30.510 --> 05:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
tons must have have that's quite a bit
 
05:52:33.310 --> 05:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing is initially this bill
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
before it was amended that it said um
 
05:52:44.350 --> 05:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
10,000 board feet and 20 cords of wood
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
or the equivalent in whole tree chips
 
05:52:51.190 --> 05:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
now this instead of saying
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
or it's it says what we just
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
had um beefed up
 
05:53:03.510 --> 05:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
plus a the whole in in addition to that
 
05:53:06.750 --> 05:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
300 tons of wood chips this is a
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in what it was
 
05:53:10.830 --> 05:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
before so I think we really need to
 
05:53:15.190 --> 05:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
understand the impact on this uh for
 
05:53:17.430 --> 05:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities yeah that wording again I
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the policy that's that's
 
05:53:21.868 --> 05:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
a prerogative of people who were elected
 
05:53:25.750 --> 05:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm not one of them uh but the uh
 
05:53:27.868 --> 05:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
problem was that calculating what that
 
05:53:27.878 --> 05:53:28.868 align:start position:0%
problem was that calculating what that
equivalent

05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
05:53:34.830 --> 05:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
was inserting complexity into the
 
05:53:36.430 --> 05:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
process whereas if you just put down a
 
05:53:38.468 --> 05:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
number and you say how many board feet
 
05:53:40.990 --> 05:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
how many cords and how many wood chips
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
that gives the local tax assessors you
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
know okay you're at 31 you're at 298 you
 
05:53:50.590 --> 05:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
pay a little bit of tax you pay none um
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
it was simpler to give them a number
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
than have them try to figure out how
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
many wood chips a wood chip could
 
05:53:57.240 --> 05:54:01.788 align:start position:0%
many wood chips a wood chip could
chip

05:54:01.788 --> 05:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative PL would you believe that
 
05:54:07.150 --> 05:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
I looked up what a ton what a cord of
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
wood weighs and it comes out to 2 to
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
5,000 pounds depending on what kind of
 
05:54:16.510 --> 05:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
wood I guess which is uh uh which is one
 
05:54:19.708 --> 05:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
to 2 and A2 tons and so if you multiply
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
30 cords by that you wind up with 30 to
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
75 tons rather than 300 and yes chips
 
05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
would have more air in it but the weight
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't change so where did the 300
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
tons come from uh that that was an
 
05:54:36.468 --> 05:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
amendment adopted in committee the those
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
members would have to say why they got
 
05:54:41.868 --> 05:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.590 --> 05:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
number representative roachford followed
 
05:54:46.868 --> 05:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
by representative Lop thank you Mr
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
chairman looking at the 30 cords and 30
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
tons of whole tree chips to me that
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
makes sense in that when you cut a tree
 
05:54:59.670 --> 05:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring anches and tops
 
05:55:00.750 --> 05:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
not considered cordwood so would you
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
agree that you know adding that 300 tons
 
05:55:08.910 --> 05:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
of chips would
 
05:55:12.430 --> 05:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
just is actually being allowing the land
 
05:55:15.868 --> 05:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
owner to do a cleaner job in their Woods
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
to uh clean up the trees and the tops
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
without having to trigger an uh attacks
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
I would agree that that sounds like a
 
05:55:25.948 --> 05:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
policy consideration thank
 
05:55:30.390 --> 05:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:32.350 --> 05:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm wondering if for
 
05:55:36.990 --> 05:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
the work session um is I'm like I know
 
05:55:39.270 --> 05:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
also how much a cord of wood is and if
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're burning 30 cords of wood for
 
05:55:44.430 --> 05:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
personal purpose your house is got to be
 
05:55:48.670 --> 05:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
like I don't know 15,000 ft it it just
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
seems like it's
 
05:55:56.190 --> 05:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
it's like we're Ways and Means so this
 
05:55:58.830 --> 05:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
seems unbelievable to me that this would
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
be for personal purpose and that that
 
05:56:03.750 --> 05:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
should not be taxed because you're not
 
05:56:06.070 --> 05:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
selling it so I would need some
 
05:56:08.468 --> 05:56:08.478 align:start position:0%
testimony during a work session that
 
05:56:10.990 --> 05:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
that this that these numbers correspond
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
to what would be a personal use for a
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.958 --> 05:57:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.948 --> 05:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.958 --> 05:57:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
out

05:57:33.070 --> 05:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
copy I gave you you have two copies
 
05:57:46.160 --> 05:57:56.868 align:start position:0%
copy I gave you you have two copies
here

05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.878 --> 05:58:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:58:07.110 --> 05:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:11.350 --> 05:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
it hello good afternoon uh for the
 
05:58:17.230 --> 05:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
record I'm Jason stock I'm the executive
 
05:58:18.590 --> 05:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Timberland
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and thank you for the
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and testify a lot of
 
05:58:26.030 --> 05:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
very good questions and I hope to answer
 
05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
answer them also with me today um Dr is
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
here to prepare is also here today to
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
prepare and prepared excuse me to answer
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
some of the what are the tax
 
05:58:40.510 --> 05:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
implications of this on the municipal
 
05:58:43.990 --> 05:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
level and I also have a a individual
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's in the in the logging business
 
05:58:49.030 --> 05:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
that can talk about okay what are we
 
05:58:51.948 --> 05:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about you know cords
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
chips board feet so hopefully I have
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
enough folks here that can answer the
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions but I I want to introduce our
 
05:59:01.868 --> 05:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
association we're a landowner Forest
 
05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
industry Association I like to say we
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
represent the entire food chain land
 
05:59:10.468 --> 05:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
owners loggers Foresters wood using
 
05:59:15.310 --> 05:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
Mills and uh we we actually sought this
 
05:59:17.788 --> 05:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
sought this legislation to address an
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
issue that we're that that we're having
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
um with small Timber sales I know there
 
05:59:25.590 --> 05:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
was concern about large clearcuts things
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
of that nature what we're talking about
 
05:59:30.430 --> 05:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
here and when you look at these volumes
 
05:59:32.030 --> 05:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about are small
 
05:59:32.040 --> 05:59:33.110 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about are small
Timber

05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
Timber
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
sales projects that are usually measured
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
in days not weeks or months of
 
05:59:44.830 --> 05:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
activity um and you know in the case of
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
personal use I know I have a I have
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
members uh who have outdoor wood boilers
 
05:59:54.190 --> 05:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
and they they burn wood as their primary
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
source um and they easily burn 15 15
 
06:00:02.350 --> 06:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
cords a year for their for in this case
 
06:00:07.230 --> 06:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
a 25 2500 square foot home so you know
 
06:00:09.270 --> 06:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
to kind of put things in perspective
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
there you know and they also Heat their
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
water and do some other things with it
 
06:00:16.350 --> 06:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
but my point is is that the volumes
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking about if you're not in the
 
06:00:21.510 --> 06:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
woods business it may seem like a lot
 
06:00:25.868 --> 06:00:25.878 align:start position:0%
300 tons you know 30 cords in our in our
 
06:00:27.670 --> 06:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
world these are these are small volum
 
06:00:30.270 --> 06:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
volumes these are for small and when you
 
06:00:32.190 --> 06:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
look at the land you know the land
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
conversion piece and and representative
 
06:00:38.350 --> 06:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
Aly uh referenced um section five which
 
06:00:41.310 --> 06:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
is land conversion what we're talking
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
about basically are small small house
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
Lots or if I'm going to put a b put a
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
barn on the back of my I call up the
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
logger I'm going to put in a barn in a
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
little riding arena for my kids this is
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
the type of projects we're talking about
 
06:01:01.070 --> 06:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
I passed out a copy of the intent to cut
 
06:01:03.788 --> 06:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire Timber's consider
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
standing Timber is considered real real
 
06:01:08.070 --> 06:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
property and it's subject to Municipal
 
06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
Taxes it's 10% of that tax in New
 
06:01:15.590 --> 06:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that tax is assessed at the
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
time of severance it's it's assessed
 
06:01:20.190 --> 06:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
when you cut it this was done quite
 
06:01:23.708 --> 06:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
intentionally because the the practice
 
06:01:25.628 --> 06:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
up into the 40s where if you wanted to
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
maintain a low tax bill you just cut all
 
06:01:30.510 --> 06:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
your wood and you just keep cutting the
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
wood and you don't have trees out there
 
06:01:35.230 --> 06:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
no Timber to assess I have a small tax
 
06:01:38.310 --> 06:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill isn't that fine well the decision
 
06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
was made and I think quite appropriately
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
by the the general court let's defer
 
06:01:46.430 --> 06:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
that tax and assess it at the time of
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
severance therefore that
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
landowner um they can they can they
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
would they can now grow those trees and
 
06:01:57.030 --> 06:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
they pay that tax when they go in and
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
and cut that wood which also happens to
 
06:02:01.468 --> 06:02:01.478 align:start position:0%
coincide with when they're getting P
 
06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
when they're getting paid for that wood
 
06:02:05.670 --> 06:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
so it worked out well and talking to
 
06:02:08.468 --> 06:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
some of the very old Foresters that were
 
06:02:10.990 --> 06:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
around back in the 30s and 20s they will
 
06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that one of the few things
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
there were several policies in in State
 
06:02:17.548 --> 06:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
history that really promoted forestry
 
06:02:20.948 --> 06:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
and Forest conservation and um and in
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
fact that the title of this law is the
 
06:02:27.310 --> 06:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
forest conservation and Taxation um Act
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
was was the fact that this tax is
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
deferred until the time of severance so
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the history of it so when
 
06:02:38.230 --> 06:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
it comes time to tax this because this
 
06:02:41.990 --> 06:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
tax is deferred and a a town can't they
 
06:02:44.590 --> 06:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
don't know when they're not mind readers
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
they're not going to know when I'm going
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
to harvest it we have What's called the
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
intent to cut process and that's the
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
form I I I distributed so when it comes
 
06:02:56.390 --> 06:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
time to do a Timber sale before I can
 
06:03:00.030 --> 06:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
Harvest my Forester logger or I'm
 
06:03:02.350 --> 06:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough as a land owner I
 
06:03:04.270 --> 06:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
fill out this form and I'm telling the
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
town all right I'm going to be
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
conducting a Timber Harvest um and
 
06:03:10.948 --> 06:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
here's what you can expect in terms of
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
species and products and I submit that
 
06:03:16.510 --> 06:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
to the town the town reviews it they
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
make sure a everyone that owns the
 
06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
property has signed it B that it is
 
06:03:26.430 --> 06:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
properly filled out and also that there
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
aren't any tax leans on the property and
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
and if I'm not if I'm in a rear and
 
06:03:33.708 --> 06:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
taxes then what they can do is they can
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
require a bond but they they look to
 
06:03:38.430 --> 06:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that the tax is pro that the
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
form's completely is properly filled out
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
the town legally has 15 days to do that
 
06:03:47.548 --> 06:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
they have 15 days essentially two weeks
 
06:03:50.670 --> 06:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
to do that and that's an important an
 
06:03:53.350 --> 06:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
important point for a large traditional
 
06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
Timber sale that that generally is not a
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
problem because of the planning that can
 
06:04:00.190 --> 06:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
go into it but when you're dealing with
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
some of these smaller projects where
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
again it's a day or two it's a day or
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
two to do a
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
project um waiting 15 days to have the
 
06:04:15.548 --> 06:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
contractors say I'm doing a project on
 
06:04:17.910 --> 06:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
my property I'm I'm clearing an area for
 
06:04:20.830 --> 06:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
a barn and a riding rink for my my kids
 
06:04:21.948 --> 06:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a we're going to get
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
a pony and we're going to have a riding
 
06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
rink we clear that my neighbor down the
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
road says says hey I'd like to do a
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
little clearing um as well we've got
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
some trees we'd like to clear out not a
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
lot can your can your logging contractor
 
06:04:40.030 --> 06:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
come over and do it well he's wrapping
 
06:04:43.070 --> 06:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
up here tomorrow for him to come back
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
leave and then come back 15 days later
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
for a handful of trees operationally
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make sense um and when you
 
06:04:56.030 --> 06:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
look at the tax implications there's not
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of taxes in involved and again Dr
 
06:05:01.628 --> 06:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
can get into the the volume or the the
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents but for for a
 
06:05:06.468 --> 06:05:06.478 align:start position:0%
contractor to mobilize and demobilize
 
06:05:09.670 --> 06:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at 5,000 about $5,000
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
these days and to do that
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
for a small volume of trees it isn't it
 
06:05:16.440 --> 06:05:18.110 align:start position:0%
for a small volume of trees it isn't it
isn't

06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
economical and so what we looked at is
 
06:05:23.468 --> 06:05:23.478 align:start position:0%
we said all right let's look at these
 
06:05:25.390 --> 06:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
personal exemptions are they still
 
06:05:27.868 --> 06:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
applicable in today's world do they
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
still make sense and that's what
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
prompted us to look at say all right
 
06:05:34.270 --> 06:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
let's increase the the exemptions for
 
06:05:36.910 --> 06:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
both the personal use but also for that
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
that paragraph five the the the land
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking at my notes here so
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
I I did a dive into the
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
20120 department of revenue report of
 
06:05:58.150 --> 06:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
cut data so I fill out my form my intent
 
06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
to cut I send it to Dr I send it to the
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
town they review it they say yes Jason
 
06:06:06.270 --> 06:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
looks great you're up to date on your
 
06:06:09.910 --> 06:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
taxes you've signed this they they they
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
sign off on it I do my project a copy
 
06:06:15.468 --> 06:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
goes to the Department of
 
06:06:18.190 --> 06:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue we do the timber sale and then
 
06:06:20.468 --> 06:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
at the end of the sale I have a I have a
 
06:06:23.270 --> 06:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
form I send of what was actually
 
06:06:25.708 --> 06:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
harvested because again you know
 
06:06:28.430 --> 06:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
measuring trees is not an exact science
 
06:06:30.670 --> 06:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
and so that's called the report of cut
 
06:06:32.910 --> 06:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
that report of cut goes to the town the
 
06:06:36.110 --> 06:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
town says oh okay you did not Harvest
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
100,000 board feet of eastern white pine
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
you only harvested 80 that's what we
 
06:06:43.948 --> 06:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
will assess your tax at where they get
 
06:06:46.510 --> 06:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
that value the dollar so you have a do
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
you have a volume and the Department of
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue twice a year does a survey of
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
the industry of land owners and of Mills
 
06:06:57.750 --> 06:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they find and to to deter terine
 
06:07:00.670 --> 06:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
what is the term is stumpage what is
 
06:07:02.468 --> 06:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
white pine stumpage that's a tree
 
06:07:05.110 --> 06:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
growing growing in the forest not the
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
log in the Woodyard but a tree in the
 
06:07:09.390 --> 06:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
forest what is what are these stumpage
 
06:07:12.468 --> 06:07:12.478 align:start position:0%
values they provide those to the town
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
the town says okay Jason did 880,000
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
board feet and that our stumpage to use
 
06:07:23.270 --> 06:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
round numbers our stumpage our stumpage
 
06:07:27.990 --> 06:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
survey shows that it's $10 $10
 
06:07:31.230 --> 06:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh per thousand board feet so they the
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
towns get this they have a range because
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
some not all not all Timber lots are are
 
06:07:38.708 --> 06:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
created equal they have a range and
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
they'll say wow that was really nice
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
that was a really nice stand of wood it
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
was easy to get at we're going to put
 
06:07:47.230 --> 06:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
them on the higher end well that that
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
was on the backside of some rock Rocky
 
06:07:51.270 --> 06:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
Mountain and it was pretty nasty
 
06:07:53.270 --> 06:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
scraggle wood will put them on the lower
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
end but based on that they assigned they
 
06:07:59.948 --> 06:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
they send me a tax bill and that's but
 
06:08:03.310 --> 06:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
off of that report a cut Dr tracks all
 
06:08:06.390 --> 06:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
this and so I I did I went in and looked
 
06:08:09.948 --> 06:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
at dr's did a request and got a copy of
 
06:08:14.110 --> 06:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
there the latest copy I had was 2020 the
 
06:08:19.030 --> 06:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
2020 tax year um report of cut report of
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
cut data
 
06:08:23.788 --> 06:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
and again to put things in perspective
 
06:08:25.948 --> 06:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
in 2020 there were
 
06:08:29.708 --> 06:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
2,326 s report of cuts filed so these
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
were these were report of cuts that were
 
06:08:34.670 --> 06:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
filed or Timber you know where someone's
 
06:08:36.990 --> 06:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
contemplating Timber or Timber
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
Harvest almost 400 of those 398 there
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
was no activity either the project
 
06:08:47.830 --> 06:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
didn't happen or the project started but
 
06:08:50.110 --> 06:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't complete and would be
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
carried over but almost 400 of that 20
 
06:08:57.788 --> 06:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
2,327 report of cuts
 
06:08:59.230 --> 06:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
06:08:59.240 --> 06:09:00.788 align:start position:0%
there was no
volume

06:09:00.788 --> 06:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
volume
 
06:09:04.910 --> 06:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh of those of the of the total volume
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
of intent to Cuts or report of cuts
 
06:09:14.430 --> 06:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
675 were 1 to 300 tons were reported 1
 
06:09:18.110 --> 06:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
to 300 tons were were reported as total
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
volumes so again to kind of give you a
 
06:09:23.350 --> 06:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the universe here that we're
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
talking about so Timber sales happen
 
06:09:30.990 --> 06:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
across the state there are a lot of them
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
many people are unaware of this because
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
they happen in the woods and and uh
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're not usually right in your right
 
06:09:41.390 --> 06:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
in your face but there are there's a lot
 
06:09:43.628 --> 06:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
of Forestry activity that occurs across
 
06:09:47.310 --> 06:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
our state um when you look at the and I
 
06:09:50.310 --> 06:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
did a quick quick analysis saying all
 
06:09:52.708 --> 06:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
right what's what's a board foot worth
 
06:09:56.310 --> 06:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
what in a board foot that's although it
 
06:09:58.708 --> 06:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
sounds like jargon let me find my here
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
it is a board foot is a it's a physical
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just what it sounds like one foot
 
06:10:09.070 --> 06:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
square by 1 inch thick that's a it's a
 
06:10:13.350 --> 06:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
volumetric measure of Timber a cord I
 
06:10:15.150 --> 06:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
think I I think there's a couple folks
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
here that burn some firewood four feet
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
high a stack four feet high by four feet
 
06:10:23.390 --> 06:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
wide by 8 feet 8 ft long and of course a
 
06:10:25.468 --> 06:10:25.478 align:start position:0%
ton is a ton
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
um so so 300 tons of wood chips uh wood
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
chips right now are about a if you can
 
06:10:36.390 --> 06:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
if you can find a market for it because
 
06:10:38.350 --> 06:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
these typically go to biomass power
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
plants if you can find a market that's a
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
big if we'll say you get about a dime
 
06:10:47.548 --> 06:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
the stumpage value is about a dime a ton
 
06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
so that's 300 tons at a dime a ton is
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
$30 in stumpage
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
value uh again assum you're you're you
 
06:11:01.868 --> 06:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
have a 10% tax 10% your ways and means
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
10% of $30 we're talking about $3 in
 
06:11:09.270 --> 06:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
taxes um on the 300
 
06:11:12.990 --> 06:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
tons volumetrically that's four four
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
what they call boxes that would be four
 
06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
trucks or excuse me 10 excuse me 10
 
06:11:19.468 --> 06:11:19.478 align:start position:0%
trucks of of wood
 
06:11:25.230 --> 06:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
chips um the on the board footage side
 
06:11:27.390 --> 06:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at here when we go to
 
06:11:30.310 --> 06:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
15,000 those are two log that would be
 
06:11:32.910 --> 06:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
15,000 board feed is about two log
 
06:11:35.788 --> 06:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
trucks these are two log trucks worth of
 
06:11:39.708 --> 06:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
logs so again it's not a huge huge
 
06:11:43.150 --> 06:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
parade of of vehicles um and as was
 
06:11:45.468 --> 06:11:45.478 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier the
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
chipwood usually is the tops it's the
 
06:11:51.628 --> 06:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
limbs it's the smaller limbs it's the
 
06:11:53.948 --> 06:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
branches it's the brush basically that
 
06:11:56.750 --> 06:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
gets chipped so I may take out two
 
06:11:59.468 --> 06:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
truckloads of logs when I take that tree
 
06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
out of the woods I cut that log off
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is the trunk of the tree the rest
 
06:12:08.350 --> 06:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
of that tree i i i i chip it again my
 
06:12:10.230 --> 06:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
client the landowner who wants to build
 
06:12:13.150 --> 06:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
the barn or wants to clear a small lot
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
for a home they don't want to have brush
 
06:12:18.030 --> 06:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
out there to contend with so I clear I
 
06:12:18.040 --> 06:12:19.150 align:start position:0%
out there to contend with so I clear I
chipped

06:12:19.150 --> 06:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
chipped
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
that and again is is is when the bill
 
06:12:23.520 --> 06:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
that and again is is is when the bill
was

06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:12:28.150 --> 06:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
introduced trying to explain a cal the
 
06:12:31.708 --> 06:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
calculations from cords board footage to
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
tons we'll just say can be challenging
 
06:12:36.510 --> 06:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
I've looked at tables and charts and you
 
06:12:38.030 --> 06:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
can get into all kind you can really go
 
06:12:40.270 --> 06:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
down a rabbit hole looking at what's the
 
06:12:43.548 --> 06:12:43.558 align:start position:0%
species what's the weight Etc so the
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
part of the rationale was saying 300 ton
 
06:12:50.310 --> 06:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
and 300 tons and again usually on these
 
06:12:54.110 --> 06:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
jobs whyatt and 300 tons is the chips
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
always are com because you because of
 
06:12:58.190 --> 06:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
the nature of the job that that
 
06:13:00.868 --> 06:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
homeowner wants those chips they want
 
06:13:02.310 --> 06:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
they don't want the brush there they
 
06:13:04.390 --> 06:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
want it gone so it's always kind of
 
06:13:05.990 --> 06:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
coming in even if you're going to cut a
 
06:13:08.590 --> 06:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
couple loads of logs or even some
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
firewood you want that you want that
 
06:13:10.638 --> 06:13:11.788 align:start position:0%
firewood you want that you want that
chipwood

06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
chipwood
 
06:13:14.590 --> 06:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
out on the on the board
 
06:13:17.670 --> 06:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
footage the we're going Jason can I stop
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
you for a minute uh you put three to
 
06:13:21.628 --> 06:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
four minutes you're at about 10 minutes
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
god um if you can just kind of final
 
06:13:28.590 --> 06:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
summarize quickly that I appreciate it I
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
will 5,000 board
 
06:13:36.150 --> 06:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
feet 5,000 board feet um that that
 
06:13:39.150 --> 06:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
equates to about aund and if it's Pine
 
06:13:41.548 --> 06:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
my calculation looking at kind of the
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
the published it's about
 
06:13:46.830 --> 06:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
$110 for for Pine Red Oak which is worth
 
06:13:49.468 --> 06:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
a little bit more it's
 
06:13:52.590 --> 06:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
$175 so again what we're talking about
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
here on these projects not a huge amount
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
of Revenue um and again the whole intent
 
06:14:01.750 --> 06:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this is to keep things moving keep
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
and make it cleaner clearer and cleaner
 
06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
and easier I'm happy apologize for going
 
06:14:09.910 --> 06:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
over problem get talking trees and I get
 
06:14:11.910 --> 06:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
excited and keep going that was helpful
 
06:14:11.920 --> 06:14:12.868 align:start position:0%
excited and keep going that was helpful
uh

06:14:12.868 --> 06:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:15.310 --> 06:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
information uh representative PL I just
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you this had me
 
06:14:21.628 --> 06:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
stumped representative fell so so thank
 
06:14:24.430 --> 06:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
you you told us the what you told us
 
06:14:28.190 --> 06:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
were were the values of selling this
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
property the the the wood correct when
 
06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
you were saying um the oak is you know
 
06:14:40.270 --> 06:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
5,000 board feet of Oak
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
$175 you're telling is that the price
 
06:14:46.270 --> 06:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
that it sells for or is that the tax
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
Timber tax on
 
06:14:51.628 --> 06:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
it that
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
is that is the tax so 5,000 board feet
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
of r Oak Red Oak is around $350 per
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
th000 board feet that has a stumpage
 
06:15:05.430 --> 06:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
value of
 
06:15:10.750 --> 06:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
$1,750 10% of 10% of that is
 
06:15:15.468 --> 06:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
$175 I I need clarification on that
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
please 5,000 Bo feet of red oak is worth
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
350 per th so 350 * 5
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
gives you
 
06:15:31.628 --> 06:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
$1,750 that's the stumpage value that's
 
06:15:33.948 --> 06:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
the Delta between current law and what
 
06:15:35.948 --> 06:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
06:15:41.948 --> 06:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:45.150 --> 06:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
1,750 the tax is
 
06:15:52.670 --> 06:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.430 --> 06:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
did you have a followup yeah yeah I'm
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
not getting this the let me ask the
 
06:16:11.868 --> 06:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
questions so you have one if you we want
 
06:16:15.270 --> 06:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
to use 1,000 that's fine so one thou
 
06:16:17.150 --> 06:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're talk going to talk about one kind
 
06:16:20.350 --> 06:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
of wood like Oak let me do that so 1,000
 
06:16:20.360 --> 06:16:21.350 align:start position:0%
of wood like Oak let me do that so 1,000
board

06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
foot of board feet of Oak is you want
 
06:16:28.670 --> 06:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
want to tell me the tax or you that no
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
the the market value the stumpage value
 
06:16:34.510 --> 06:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
for your 1,000 board fee to O is
 
06:16:34.520 --> 06:16:36.868 align:start position:0%
for your 1,000 board fee to O is
$350

06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
$350
 
06:16:39.708 --> 06:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
right Timber tax on that that's the
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
that of the
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
350 well no it's 300 yes in this case
 
06:16:55.468 --> 06:16:55.478 align:start position:0%
with 1,000 if 1,000 board feet M it
 
06:16:57.750 --> 06:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
would be 10% % of
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
that so are all the taxes 10% of do you
 
06:17:04.190 --> 06:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
chart um I know Dr can provide copies of
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
what they assess at but it's 10 10% is
 
06:17:14.110 --> 06:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
the timber tax so that it's a pretty
 
06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
simple chart 10% but they do have the
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
assessed values in their their
 
06:17:22.708 --> 06:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
reports okay I'm going to uh um do you
 
06:17:24.468 --> 06:17:24.478 align:start position:0%
have a just to put just so everyone
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
knows the timing I'm trying to finish by
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
by 4:00 because I do have people that
 
06:17:30.750 --> 06:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
need to leave at that time um
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
so representative um rord follows by
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes thank you and I
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
do have one more pink card just short
 
06:17:39.708 --> 06:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
ones oh you do have another pink all
 
06:17:42.310 --> 06:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
right yeah so I'll just ask one of my
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
two questions maybe the next pink card
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
can answer this I uh just I have some
 
06:17:48.948 --> 06:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
loggers in my community as my
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
constituents and when the whole Burgess
 
06:17:53.590 --> 06:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
power plant issue came up uh talking
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
about a source for the biomass like you
 
06:17:57.628 --> 06:17:57.638 align:start position:0%
said there's not a lot of places you can
 
06:17:59.548 --> 06:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
bring it but even when they could bring
 
06:18:02.310 --> 06:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
it somewhere um they were saying there's
 
06:18:03.868 --> 06:18:03.878 align:start position:0%
really not a lot of value in it anyway
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
but by the time you pay for fuel and
 
06:18:07.628 --> 06:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
truck it all over the North country and
 
06:18:10.270 --> 06:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
and and otherwise there's really not a a
 
06:18:14.230 --> 06:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
lot of value in it so um that being said
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
a could you confirm that and B uh it if
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's true it doesn't seem like 300
 
06:18:24.468 --> 06:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
tons of whole chip trees have a whole
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
lot of monetary value to them
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
them correct and the the value I
 
06:18:33.270 --> 06:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
assigned a ton of wood chips is 30 is is
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
a dime so it's $30 is the stumpage value
 
06:18:40.270 --> 06:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
10% of that which is your Timber tax is
 
06:18:46.230 --> 06:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:51.868 --> 06:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
lot represent Aly yes on what does this
 
06:18:51.878 --> 06:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
lot represent Aly yes on what does this
also

06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:18:56.510 --> 06:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
cover the large
 
06:18:56.520 --> 06:18:58.628 align:start position:0%
cover the large
Timber

06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
Timber
 
06:19:01.590 --> 06:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
Cutters that we've got some of in New
 
06:19:04.750 --> 06:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are a lot of in
 
06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
Maine but it it wouldn't because of the
 
06:19:11.788 --> 06:19:11.798 align:start position:0%
the size limits again when you look at
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
these size
 
06:19:16.590 --> 06:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
limits these are small Timber
 
06:19:18.990 --> 06:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
sailes with you know two we're talking
 
06:19:22.110 --> 06:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
two truckloads of logs there you know
 
06:19:25.270 --> 06:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
two truckloads of logs is that's the
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
scope of things things that we're
 
06:19:29.868 --> 06:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
talking about so it's not the
 
06:19:32.350 --> 06:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
huge you know it's not again I know
 
06:19:33.910 --> 06:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
there was a concern about clear cutting
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's not large moonscapes it's it's
 
06:19:40.750 --> 06:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
a couple loads of logs and the chipwood
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
associated with that and it's although
 
06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
10 10 boxes might seem like a lot those
 
06:19:48.430 --> 06:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
branches and and twigs fill up a box
 
06:19:50.868 --> 06:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
pretty darn
 
06:19:53.070 --> 06:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
quickly okay thank
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you again I apologize for
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
going no problem it's been very helpful
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
and uh last um pin card I have is
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
Dr afternoon uh my name is Adam denor
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant director of the
 
06:20:17.230 --> 06:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division at Dr um
 
06:20:18.430 --> 06:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
part of the responsibility of the
 
06:20:19.708 --> 06:20:19.718 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division is to
 
06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
help administer the timber
 
06:20:25.948 --> 06:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
tax so as Jason mentioned the actual tax
 
06:20:28.548 --> 06:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
impact of this amendment is
 
06:20:31.150 --> 06:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
negligible uh what I did was I took the
 
06:20:33.310 --> 06:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
last four years of Timber tax data so
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's going back to
 
06:20:38.350 --> 06:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um and Tred to extract from all of
 
06:20:39.868 --> 06:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
the reports that we received for every
 
06:20:42.350 --> 06:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
single one of these years just those
 
06:20:44.430 --> 06:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
reports which would have qualified under
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
this exemption and then determine an
 
06:20:50.310 --> 06:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
actual tax amount um when you take that
 
06:20:52.350 --> 06:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
apart into four separate years and then
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
into 259 taxing districts because we're
 
06:20:56.990 --> 06:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
talking about about every possible Town
 
06:20:59.230 --> 06:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
unincorporated that could have a report
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
filed with them it's about
 
06:21:05.150 --> 06:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
$200 per town that this would that the
 
06:21:07.590 --> 06:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
impact would be so it's rather small and
 
06:21:09.270 --> 06:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
of course many of those towns are not
 
06:21:13.670 --> 06:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to have Timber intents um and the
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
one variable that's very difficult to
 
06:21:17.670 --> 06:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
control for and looking at this is the
 
06:21:19.070 --> 06:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
number of these operations that would
 
06:21:21.310 --> 06:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
actually qualify for the exemption it's
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
important to note this is about land
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
conversion it's not about Forest
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
management so if you have a nice stand
 
06:21:30.430 --> 06:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
of Oak that you want to slowly cut away
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
at and sell that's not what this
 
06:21:34.270 --> 06:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
exemption is for it's for clearing a
 
06:21:35.830 --> 06:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
building lot or as Jason mentioned a
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
barn or riding arena something like that
 
06:21:40.190 --> 06:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
you're there to kind of make space to to
 
06:21:41.590 --> 06:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
do something else with that that
 
06:21:43.948 --> 06:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
property as opposed to just manage your
 
06:21:46.628 --> 06:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
forest and avoid Timber tax while doing
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's about $200 um per town
 
06:21:54.708 --> 06:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.390 --> 06:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
found anybody
 
06:22:00.990 --> 06:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
else yes representative Ames just to ask
 
06:22:03.468 --> 06:22:03.478 align:start position:0%
uh do you have that information that you
 
06:22:05.430 --> 06:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
just gave in some kind of form that can
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
be shared with us absolutely yeah yeah
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
it would be good sounds
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
good repres bolon and as following up to
 
06:22:16.430 --> 06:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
that and by
 
06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
Town um because I live in the town of uh
 
06:22:21.310 --> 06:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and we've I've signed quite a
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
few of these I'm also a select board
 
06:22:24.468 --> 06:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
member up there sure and I think some
 
06:22:25.708 --> 06:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
towns might be more effective than
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
others but yeah no that's definitely
 
06:22:28.628 --> 06:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
true and I think we could probably break
 
06:22:35.468 --> 06:22:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:39.948 --> 06:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:44.628 --> 06:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:47.868 --> 06:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
here Notch
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair H GRA with the
 
06:22:53.030 --> 06:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um we are neutral
 
06:22:54.990 --> 06:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
on the bill um I just want to comment on
 
06:22:57.510 --> 06:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we did reach out to some assessors
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
on it um when it came across our desk um
 
06:23:04.628 --> 06:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
and they had done the same math that Dr
 
06:23:07.150 --> 06:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
did which Dr will provide you um it was
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
a very minimal cost
 
06:23:12.110 --> 06:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
and even though it was it was $200 per
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
town that was collected in like5 and $10
 
06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
increments over multiple cuts um largely
 
06:23:20.110 --> 06:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
when they broke it down so it ended up
 
06:23:22.110 --> 06:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
being the case that the administrative
 
06:23:24.590 --> 06:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
burden of collecting $5 from somebody
 
06:23:28.030 --> 06:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
was more more than more than all the
 
06:23:30.948 --> 06:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
paperwork required for it so um we are
 
06:23:32.430 --> 06:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
neutral on that but I'm happy to take
 
06:23:34.310 --> 06:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
any questions if the committee has it
 
06:23:34.320 --> 06:23:36.948 align:start position:0%
any questions if the committee has it
thank

06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:39.948 --> 06:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you I think we're good thank
 
06:23:42.150 --> 06:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else that would like
 
06:23:45.390 --> 06:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
to testify on
 
06:23:48.670 --> 06:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
hbb we're in the SBS now s SP
 
06:23:50.910 --> 06:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
