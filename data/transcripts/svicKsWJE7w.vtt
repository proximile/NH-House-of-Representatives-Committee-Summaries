I'm going to give a little bit of
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
history about the bill um House Bill 230
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh came out of a study uh committee
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
which I chaired in 2019 so House Bill
 
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
524 uh turned into uh a study where we
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
had five meetings with the public the
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee was charged to examine the
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy of daycare programs and
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
Facilities across the state identify
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
issues and impediments to starting
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
running and growing both Home and
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
Commercial daycare facilities and also
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
identify ways to reverse the current
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
Trend this is 2019 of child care
 
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.230 align:start position:0%
Trend this is 2019 of child care
facility

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
closures so uh after five meetings and
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
many many hours of testimony we compiled
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
a report identifying several of the pain
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
points to the child care industry on the
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
business side in hopes that we could
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
come up with a bipartisan solution uh
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
this was very much about resolving
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
issues to make sure that businesses can
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
survive that parents can get child care
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and that the children are safe and of
 
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
course it's always a
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
negotiation uh so in 2020 uh we did
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill that unfortunately did
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
not make it through due to covid um it
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
was actually a series of bills in 2020
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
and what I've done for the 2021 session
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
since we're limited on time and this is
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
all pretty much hybrid or remote all of
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bills that were were introduced in
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
2020 have been combined here in 2021
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
into what I'm calling an Omnibus
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
business of child care bill so the bill
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
itself really seeks to solve some issues
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
that were uncovered during the study um
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh hearings and findings in
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
2019 uh the first is coming up with a
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
procedure that is more fair for
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
businesses for posting the results of
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
child care monitoring visits on the DHHS
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
website and also providing additional
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
time for business owners to respond to
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
the Department's
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
findings uh the second thing is to
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of continuing ed uh
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
required of um professionals working in
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
the child care industry right now the
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
number of hours is 18 and this bill
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
seeks it to drop it to six hours there
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
were many reasons cited uh but one of
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
the big ones was because uh there seems
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
of difficulty in getting those hours and
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
also uh for child care employees who
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay for their own continuing ed
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
there is a hurdle to both finding the
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
time often they are taking care of their
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
own children in their off time and
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
paying for continuing aded so we did a
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
comparison between other professions
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
that also have a a heightened standard
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
of um safety uh police officers in New
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need eight hours of continuing
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
ed per year and lawyers need 12 hours uh
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then comparing salary of those two
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
professions to child care uh we felt
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
that six was an adequate compromise and
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it's written in the bill this
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill the way it is um in
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
addition uh we established the minimum
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications for certification as a
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
child care associate teacher allowing
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
life experience to count
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
um there are quite a few individuals who
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
would be interested in um meeting the
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
standards but would not be able to
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually attend college level courses
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
and so this would take life experience
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
in as um allowable for for being an
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
associate teacher also we looked at
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
diversity in the industry and it appears
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
that while there are quite a few
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
children who represent minority
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
populations it's very rare to find an
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
associate teacher who's a minority and
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
this may be an impediment requiring the
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
college level uh
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
credits uh finally step four we uh
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
changed some of the requirements for the
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
appeals process following a dispute
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
between the state coming in and doing an
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
audit of a child care um
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
facility basically uh there was some
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
concern about uh retaliatory behavior
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
and whether a facility truly needed to
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
be closed following uh
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
a major finding after the state came in
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
and did an audit and so this is
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully to clarify the language in
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
this bill uh to allow that facility to
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
remain open until the pendency of the
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
appeal is
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
completed and then uh finally the goal
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
on step five is to study the creation of
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
a neutral appeals process to review
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
violations committed by child um Care
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
Facility uh obviously the concern here
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
again is retaliatory Behavior
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
and um feeling as though when someone
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
comes in and audits a facility the
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
person who's looking at that facility
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
may be the judge jury and executioner
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
and there really didn't seem to be a
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
neutral third party or a process for
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
review outside of the state um assigned
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
staff so that's really what this bill
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
sets out to do and I'm happy to answer
 
00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.230 align:start position:0%
sets out to do and I'm happy to answer
any

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there questions
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee question represent thank you
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me uh thank you for
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I um I'm just curious
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
how many total um child daycare center
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
from your studies daycare centers are
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
there and um roughly how many Clos in
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
the past year two
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
years you know I don't have that data in
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
front of me and I don't want to give you
 
00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:22.990 align:start position:0%
front of me and I don't want to give you
bad

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
bad
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
data um you know I would say that we're
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
over a thousand but I can't give you the
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
actual number for total um and closures
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
are a little bit difficult to track
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
because often what will happen is the
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
facility will close and reopen under
 
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
facility will close and reopen under
another

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
name uh so it may not truly be a closure
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to defer to the state to
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
get you that data with some future
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
testimony yes thank you they would know
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions there's one representative
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair there
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
um representative mck Williams can you
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
um go over again the professional
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
development um hours the change in that
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
and also do you have any um information
 
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.629 align:start position:0%
and also do you have any um information
that

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
compares what you're propo what we have
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
now and what you're proposing to what
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
require that's an excellent question um
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate the current
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
requirement is 18 hours of doing Ed um
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and some facilities are able to provide
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
that for their staff um some facilities
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
require the staff to do that on their
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
own time with their own dime um this
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
proposal seeks to reduce it to six
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
18 um I know we looked at Vermont and I
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
can dig that up for you and get back to
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
you on that I don't have it in front of
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
me um but it did appear that New
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was higher than our
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
neighboring states I don't know the
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
exact numbers but I'll get back to to on
 
00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
exact numbers but I'll get back to to on
that

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
one thank you um just followup follow up
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um isn't the the number of professional
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh development hours is different for
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
different kinds of Staff isn't it and
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
are you just changing
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
one so the the blanket you are correct
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
there there are two different levels the
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
blanket change drops everything to six
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's written um I believe
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
that part-time under a certain number of
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
hours is less than 18 I believe it's 12
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
hours for part-time and once again I'll
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
let the state um give you the exact
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
correct data on that um yes thank you
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair uh
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams did you did
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh acquire the knowledge either
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
through your Commissioner of your own of
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
your own uh efforts to determine what
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
the marketplace uh offers uh with regard
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
to competitive work for um people who
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be potential Child Care employees
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of wages and
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
benefits yes this was something that we
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
heard quite quite a bit of testimony
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
about from people who attended the the
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
study committee hearings uh it appears
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
that um although minimum wage in New
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
$7.25 uh most facilities are able to
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
offer in a range of somewhere around $ 9
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
to $15 for child care um
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
staff uh unfortunately that still seems
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be a bit of a bar to retaining staff
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
um because some of the retail positions
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
in the state are offering 15 to 18 or
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
even 19 an hour so what we're seeing is
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
that it's sometimes or in in many cases
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
in 2019 it was awfully difficult to
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
replace a staff person once they had
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
left because we were looking to find
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
someone who already had the continuing
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
ed credits um and also was willing to
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
work for something less than say a
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
entrylevel retail position in their
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
Community often U so it is a battle to
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
both find and retain staff and uh as I
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
said the the study committee was really
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
tasked with reducing
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
impediments Qui followup
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
followup so and and uh in terms of entry
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
into the workplace uh it sounds
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
like you know child care workers have
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
have requirements education wise
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
training wise uh whereas uh the the
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
Walmart hypothetically they can walk
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
right in the
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
door that is correct and that
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.189 align:start position:0%
door that is correct and that
is

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
question did we not have uh a bill
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
similar to this last year and the
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
committee found that six hours was far
 
00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
committee found that six hours was far
too

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
few you are correct on that individual
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
bill um we were in the process of
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
negotiating that number up when
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
kaput followup
 
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
kaput followup
followup

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
and is it true that the committee has
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
received some testimony from child care
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
agencies out there uh not wanting to
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
lower it this slow and that we should
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
probably be looking at maybe another
 
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.509 align:start position:0%
probably be looking at maybe another
number

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm open to an amendment on the
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
number of hours I was open to an
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
amendment in 2020 I'm open to an
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
amendment now I think that this is a
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
negotiated thing thank
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no other hands are there
 
00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.390 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no other hands are there
other

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.470 align:start position:0%
other
questions

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
Clemen

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
yes good morning thank you madam chair
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
um Lissa Clement I'm the chief of the
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing unit and um the
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
information I'm going to provide um well
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'll provide this information then I'll
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
also obviously be open for questions um
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
the first thing when looking at the bill
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
under number
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
one um the we are looking for some
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
consistency with how the days and
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
business days are
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill on line8 it states
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
21 days while line 10 states 15 business
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
days and we would just recommend that
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
clear

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
two line
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
20 I provided the committee with a chart
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
um this morning via email which outlines
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
the professional development
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
requirements in other states New
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires 18 hours for staff
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
working 25 or more hours and for all
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
directors and Lead teachers 12 hours for
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
staff working fewer than 25 hours except
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
for those directors and Lead teachers
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
and three hours for high school students
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
and full-time college students um by the
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
federal requirements under the um Child
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
Development block grant act we do have
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
to require some number of professional
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
hours per year and but the number of
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
hours is under the discretion of the
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
state um to to summarize the other New
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
England states um only Vermont requires
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
fewer hours at 15 for all staff Broadley
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for full-time staff in
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut require 20 hours and Maine
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
requires 30
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
hours um when this issue was heard by
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
the committee last year under HB 17113
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
there were work sessions with members of
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the department and child care
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
providers as child care providers were
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
split on the reduction of hours out of
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
those sessions the department made a
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
commitment to allow first aid and CPR to
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
count towards those 18 hours currently
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
that was excluded under um currently
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
that's excluded under our rules um the
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
bill was determined to be inexpedient to
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
legislate noting the work done in the
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee from the Department to revise
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
the rule and we're working on revisions
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
of the childcare licensing rules which
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
will allow for that um as you know with
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
covid things have gotten a little crazy
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
so the work on our revision of the rules
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
hasn't progressed as we thought it would
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
last year but we are committed and we're
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
doing that this
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
year um in addition for professional
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
development the Department of Labor
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
confirmed that any number of hours above
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
what law or rule requires must be paid
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
for by the employer so if programs wish
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
to have their staff complete more
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
professional development it would be at
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
a cost to them which they are not not
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
required currently to pay for um many
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunities
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
are free or low cost there is the um
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
Child Care aware of New Hampshire which
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of ta and training for
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
child care providers at minimum
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
cost um moving on to the section
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
qualifications um which are the
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications that are allowed to
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
supervise a group of children alone
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
looking at line 22 starting there what
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
is proposed is um for an associate
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
teacher which is a minimum of a thousand
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
hours of supervised child care
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
experience and a licensed Child Care
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
Program and 30 hours of training in
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
child growth and development the latter
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
of which may be documented life
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
experience um one question the
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
department has is what is meant by
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
documented life experience and who's
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
making that determination is that
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
determination being made by the program
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
when they're hiring someone is that some
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that documented life experience
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
something the department will be
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
required to create rules around what
 
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.669 align:start position:0%
required to create rules around what
that

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
means um and then also to address
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
something that many of the committee
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
members may have seen earlier this week
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um there was an article in Union Leader
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
which implied that all teachers in child
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
care programs are required to have
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees so in case that is
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
something that everyone has seen um or
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
some of you have I just want to clarify
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
that is inaccurate it um associate

grp group leader it which would be the
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
um term that they use for someone who

the three neighboring states to New
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that obviously compete with
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
for employers um and that gives you some
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
information as to what other states are
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%

all I just want to uh say say a
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
correction HB 17113 in 2020 the one that
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
would have changed or lowered the number
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
of required college credits actually was
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
not I uh an expedient to legislate um it
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
was tabled I believe it was uh ought to
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
pass was the motion we would have
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
considered had we voted on it then but
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
then because of Co it died so there's
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
one um two okay so you mentioned some
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
states uh the surrounding states to New
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you know what their minimum
 
00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:33.789 align:start position:0%

wage

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
wage
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
is I do not know uh for Vermont it's
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
$11.75 an hour for Maine it's $11 in
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
$12 um you must know that New Hampshire
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a minimum wage and it's 725
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%

in here in New Hampshire yeah I believe
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
um representative McWilliams spoke to
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
that she and I would agree with what she
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
said for a range of $9 to $15 or so that
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
that would be average for childcare
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
workers great thank

Shu thank you madam chair uh good
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
morning Miss Clement um you mentioned
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
that you have been
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
negotiating uh the fact of the
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
continuing hours I was wondering if you
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
felt that those negotiations are close
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
to coming to an agreement and what that
 
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.430 align:start position:0%
to coming to an agreement and what that
might

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
be so for the professional development
 
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:49.519 align:start position:0%
hours um what we are considering because
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
we did hear strong opinions from both
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
childcare providers for and against it
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
the negotiated agreement at that what we
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
came to with the work sessions last year
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
was that we would start counting first
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
aid in CPR much of that training can be
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
four to six hours so that that would be
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
an addition of hours that they can now
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
count towards their annual hours that
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
they were not able to count previously
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
compromise thank you we are still Contin
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
we are still continuing to you know hear
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
from providers nothing is said in stone
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
but that is where we're starting from
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
based on the work that was done last
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
year followup
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um so my next
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
um would you feel that degrees that are
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
granted by community colleges which we
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
all know are a lot less expensive than
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh higher uh schools of Education are
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
adequate to obtain jobs at these
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
positions so we're not asking for full
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
degrees um in order if we're talking
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
about about the associate teacher
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
requirements we ask for nine credits in
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
early childhood so that is the
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
equivalent of three courses typically at
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
a community college or maybe four
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
courses Grant State College Awards four
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
credits per course so yes so um I mean
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we're at right now
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
based on neighboring states based on the
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
research done that some level of
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
coursework is necessary in order to
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand children's CH growth and
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
development and be able to provide safe
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
and healthy environment for them so
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
that's where we've started from um but
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
we recognize that there could be other
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
ways to obtain that um those degrees and
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have just this year launched the
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
department a teacher apprenticeship
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
program and also have we are also now
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
working with um doing teach program
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
which helps pay for college coursework
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
as well and that's being done through
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Development and Head
 
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.549 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Development and Head
Start

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%

00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration thank you you're welcome
 
00:30:57.559 --> 00:31:00.149 align:start position:0%
collaboration thank you you're welcome
representative

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
Bara thank you uh Madam chair Miss
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
Clemens I was on the subcommittee for
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
the um the the amendment to this bill
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
last year and at that time you had
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were going to be um
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
adding CPR and first aid to the
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
requirements to those requirements that
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to count to lower help lower
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
the uh required education so
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
how much longer would that
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
take hopefully not much longer we plan
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
to do that this year like I said we're
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with providers next week um in
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
order to you know flesh out some of
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
those staff qualification issues um
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're working on revising the rule but
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
you know how rul making works we need to
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
have our draft completed and submitted
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
over to the Joint Committee on
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislative you know joint
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
administrative committee on legislative
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
rules and go through that process so I
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate by the Fall um if not sooner
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
but you know it it is a process and our
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
rules are quite large and we are working
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
on streamlining them and doing a lot
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
more than just this one thing because
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
there are there are other things that
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
we've identified that we want to address
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
as well thank
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
Miss clemet so I'm glad to see you're
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
doing comparative studies with regard to
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states I'm wondering
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
whether you're monitoring to see whether
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
our our system is working in terms of
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
having sufficient labor force available
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
um to meet the competency requirements
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh because uh while you've
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
given us some very interesting
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
information uh it it it's more
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
differentiated than just some of the
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
parameters you've given us so is it
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
working in New
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm not sure I'm qualified
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
to answer that question um I know
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
obviously are you trying are you trying
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
to monitor that aspect whether it's
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
working or not um we're taking
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
information from the um providers that
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
we license um and determining what
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
issues that they are having we are also
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
noting that it's kind of a chicken and
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
egg scenario where if providers can't
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of money they're
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
offering for staff then it's hard to
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
attract people to those positions
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not um the education
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
requirements are higher or lower I've
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
heard from providers that even if
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're putting ads out there and I'm
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure you'll have providers speak to this
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
even putting ads out there they're not
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
getting anyone to even respond never
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
mind whether they're qualified or not
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
once they do respond and they have a
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to them so it's I I'm not
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
sure that the rule is the necessarily
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
the place to address that our rules are
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that the care that is being
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
provided to Children is safe and
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
adequate and it's not really a place
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
where we can look to address the child
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
care needs which have been going on for
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
years this isn't a new phenomenon this
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
is something that's been happening a
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
long time but we are doing our best to
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
get our PS pults on that and to see what
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
we can do thank you madam chair other
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
wish to touch base briefly on sections
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
three and four of the proposed
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislation with respect to section
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
three on page one line
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
25 the department would simply like to
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
point out that the inclusion of the
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
language in paragraph two to allow a
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
leny the right to appeal and informal
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution goes above and beyond
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
the rights of other lenses not just
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
those in child
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
care Additionally the department did not
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
receive a request for a fiscal note
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
worksheet for this legislation but I
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
would just point out that there would be
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
a significant fiscal impact to the
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
department for this additional right of
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
appeal this would be an entirely new
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
process that is unfamiliar to both child
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
care licensing staff and to the hearings
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
examiners at the administrative Appeals
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Unit and if the committee decides to
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
move forward with this portion of the
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the department would would
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
need at least one additional staff
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
position in the child care licensing
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
unit to handle this new work as well as
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
one additional hearings examiner in the
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit as this is
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
again not something they've done before
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
and would certainly add to the number of
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
appeals being
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
heard okay Excuse Me Miss Tom this is
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
three the licens sees and hearings
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 25
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
you with respect to section four on page
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
two line 14 this is the section about
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
retaliation being prohibited the
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
department is in agreement that there
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
should be no retaliation against an
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
applicant permittee or a lensey and that
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
action certainly should be taken to
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
investigate any allegations of
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
retaliation however the department
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
wishes to propose an alternative to the
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
process outlined in the proposed
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislation if there is a
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
concern hearings examiners do not have
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to determine what
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
constitutes retaliation as there are no
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
rules or laws surrounding the definition
 
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.309 align:start position:0%
rules or laws surrounding the definition
of

00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
retaliation what evidence is required to
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
prove retaliation exists nor what would
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate relief consequently
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
the department suggests that perhaps a
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
more appropriate Avenue to investigate
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
claims of retaliation would be for a
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
report to be made to the commissioner's
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
office and investigated by the
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
department in order to take appropriate
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
action against any Department employee
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
having found to be in violation of this
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
section if you have language that says
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
so please send it to us sure and that
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony Madam chair
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions at
 
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions at
this

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
time representative Schmidt has a
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
very much miss Tom um if you were
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
present at the jail car uh discussion
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
and hearing uh several years ago with
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
regard to this specific issue you'll
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
recall there was quite a bit of push
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
back from a number of providers uh with
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
regard to a sense that uh that the
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors were sometimes characterized
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
or perceived as um you know execu well
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
judge jury and executioner with regard
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
serial nature of Investigations that
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
that the Jael car committee was unhappy
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
about um and so the language that that
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
you've been suggesting I think uh please
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
massage it if you haven't already done
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
so to to uh address that particular
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
aspect as
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I call uh Miss
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:05.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I call uh Miss
ensen

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
you hi there my name is Jen enin um
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak today I
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
am giving testimony and opposition of
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 230 and it is specifically
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
Parts two and three of the bill that I
 
00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.230 align:start position:0%
Parts two and three of the bill that I
opposed

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I have a few points to make um one is
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of the trilemma of child care
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is a term that was coined first by
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
Gwen Morgan um and it speaks to the
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
compensation quality and affordability
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
um and to give a little more clarity on
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
what that
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
means just pull this up
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.510 align:start position:0%
means just pull this up
here

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
so the trilemma identifies three goals
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
of Early Childhood programs how to meet
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
any one of these goals creates conflicts
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
for the other two the result of the
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
trilemma is a problem that everyone who
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
cares about young children must help
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
solve so if you think about um Quality
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
depending on knowledgeable experienced
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
Child Care teachers and providers who
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
are justly compensated um it's expensive
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
um and not affordable for many families
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
compensation for child care teachers and
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
providers continues to be inadequate in
 
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
order to keep programs affordable to
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
parents and results in low self-esteem
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
and high turnover of child care teachers
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
and providers both of which have
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
negative effects on program quality and
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
then affordability for parents has
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in child care teachers and
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
providers contributing to the true cost
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
of child care through their poor
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
compensation so that was that was
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
directly taken from um uh
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
a document that I I will send along to
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
you when I have a chance to put that
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
together um but I think that it's
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
important to think about those two
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
components of the um requirements
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
reducing the requirements
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
for professional development will have a
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the quality of care
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
that is offered to children and I
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate I I can't remember the name
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the um the individual who was
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
speaking about comparing the amount of
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
hours required for
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
police I I am an early childhood
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
educator I've been in the field for 20
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
years I'm currently uh a director and a
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
teacher I'm actually at my school right
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
now I just stepped out so I could attend
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
and give testimony but I looked Instead
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
at nurses and and teachers um you know
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
Public School teachers and the required
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
hours for a a nurse is 400 over four
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
years and actually let me verify that
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
yep 400 in four years and for uh a
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
teacher I have a
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire state certification
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
Nursery through grade three and I'm
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
required to have 75 hours over three
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
years um and I think it's important to
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
consider the idea
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
that um I'm sorry I just lost my notes
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:27.150 align:start position:0%
that um I'm sorry I just lost my notes
Here

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
Here
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
that child care is truly the
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of our child care is a
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
critical part of our state's
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um and this has been
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
illuminated especially by the current
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic um because when when people
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't go to work
 
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
um our our economy couldn't function and
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
Care is not just keeping children safe
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
and out of Harm's Way Learning Happens
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
the moment of child is born and it's
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
important to ensure that the people who
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
are caring for the children have a depth
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
in knowledge of what is required to
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
support healthy development I also um am
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
putting together a written testimony
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
that I can share as well but part things
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at in that are the
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
um expulsion and suspension rates in
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
early childhood programs um throughout
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
the United States and and in our state
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking
 
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.470 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking
about

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh something that was illuminated
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
recently um with regard to New Hampshire
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
schools um I found an article that was
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
speaking to 8% of Elementary AED
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
children were suspended or expelled at
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
the Christal moli School in
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
2018 and knowing that brain development
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
is exponential
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
Fast and Furious during the first eight
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
years of
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
life making choices that are impacting
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
the quality of care at that young age is
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to have a terrible impact on
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
children going forward and then it will
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
drain the schools the other I have one
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
last thing to to point out and then I
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
will um be finished but I just wanted to
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
say I was looking at the salaries of
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
teachers so every teacher at at my
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
program has a master's degree and we all
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
choose to work with the youngest
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
children my salary is about $37,000 a
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
year and I am a director with 20 years
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
experience and I teach in the classroom
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
the teachers um Public School teachers
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
currently it's almost double so the
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
state average salary for a teacher um in
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
6178876367

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
6178876367
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
um and that you know they're also
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
benefits and so forth so my major point
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
is that these two elements should be
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
taken out of this bill and need to be
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
looked at with a lens of how we can
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
develop and sustain
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh Workforce where teachers are
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
compensated it is Affordable and we can
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
provide high quality thank you thank you
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
questions from the
committee

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
hi good morning and uh thank you for
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
testifying um and thank you for uh
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me the moment to uh to question
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh the witness on you've made a number
 
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:41.079 align:start position:0%
of definitive statements um on the
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
effects of some of these changes and I'm
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
not going to uh go through each one but
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
I will point out one as an example and
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
ask you to please elaborate a little bit
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
for instance on what basis are you
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
concluding other than opinion
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
on what basis are you concluding that a
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
decrease in hours would uh necessarily
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
care thank you for that question so part
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
of this is based on um the understanding
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
of what is required for professional
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
development currently the state requires
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing requires six hours
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
in health and safety training so if we
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
go that that's part of the 18 hours so
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
if we go from 18 hours to six then all
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is required is health and safety
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
and if I um look
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
from Child Care aware of New Hampshire
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
in thinking about choosing child care
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
and what what quality looks like um it
 
00:47:56.359 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
and what what quality looks like um it
speaks

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
speaks
 
00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:01.990 align:start position:0%
speaks
to

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
oh you know here it states associate
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
teachers must have a high degree um must
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
have a high school diploma and nine
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
credits in early childhood education and
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
it states here that um New Hampshire
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
requires 18 hours per year of ongoing
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
training in all I mean in early
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
childhood education for all center staff
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
with the idea being that if if you're
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at health and safety it's
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
kind of it like puts me in the police
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
perspective being someone who is in the
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
classroom every day if I am only
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
learning about health and safety I'm
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
just keeping children safe there is so
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
much more that goes into Child
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
quality I mean if you think about the
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
learning that is happening these are
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
some of the the indicators of quality so
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
if you're providing high quality care
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
for children you're helping infants form
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
and prolong secure attachments so it's
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
important to understand what that looks
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
like um you are
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
also helping infants with positive
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
identity formation you are including
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
families in child rearing practices as
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
part of care you're treating babies
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
differently at different points along
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
their developmental
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
trajectory thank you you're
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
welcome no other
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
baldini good morning can you hear me yes
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning my name is
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
Samantha baldini I'm the owner of two
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
licensed Child Care Centers the Godard
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
schools in Nashua and dar New Hampshire
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the community for
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
allowing me time to speak today on the
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
importance of House Bill 230 section 4
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
regarding retaliation by the New
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire childcare licensing
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
unit as a victim of retaliation I feel
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
that it is important that I speak out on
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
the importance of improved oversight of
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
the cclu there are many child care
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
providers in the state who are afraid to
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
do so and I hope that my experience will
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
give them a voice as well section four
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
is critical to support the child care
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
industry providers currently have no way
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves against retaliatory
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
behavior from childcare licensers who
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
have unchecked power over them my
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
experience with a retaliatory visit from
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire childcare licensing
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
occurred on November 20th
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
2019 documentation on this visit in the
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
form of video and letters from my
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
teachers were emailed to the committee
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
this morning on this date two licensers
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire childcare licensing
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
arrived at one of my centers for a
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
monitoring and visit it's important to
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
note a few things first a monitoring
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
visit is scheduled by cclu to check on a
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
Center it is not due to any complaint or
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
investigation second two experienced
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
licensers are never together on a
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring visit cclu is tightly staffed
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
and this activity is regularly completed
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
by one
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
licenser thirdly I had previously filed
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
a complaint against one of these
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
licensers for insulting a child in my
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
Center in front of her mother the other
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
licenser had previously had her findings
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
of our Center overturned when she was
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
new to the job as she had grossly
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
miscalculated ratios incorrectly and
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
failed to ask for a copy of the staff
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
schedule to determine her
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
findings our visit on November 20th 2019
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
began with the two licensers sneaking
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
into my building through clearly marked
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
security barriers they failed to check
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
in with any management and entered
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
straight into our infant classroom my
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
husband saw them and asked them to come
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
out and meet with him to introduce
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
themselves they did not want to leave
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
the room to talk to him and he had to
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
demand that they do so in this
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
interaction one licenser actually said
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
to him quote we can do whatever we want
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
want we are
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
licensing they also lied about how they
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
got into the building as we were later
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
able to prove with video footage which
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
has been provided to this
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
committee we let them continue their
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring visit in our classrooms and
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
we called the head of childcare
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
licensing to express our concerns the
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
head of cclu did nothing to check their
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
behavior and their visit continued in a
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
manner that was abusive to my teachers
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
the licensers were regularly sarcastic
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
and multiple times they singled out
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
teachers in a classroom using their
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
bodies to Corner them away from the
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
children they were they were supervising
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
and bad badgering them the day was a
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
nightmare for my entire team as I have
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
emailed the letters from my teachers to
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
this committee I will just provide a few
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
highlights of what they said about the
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
visit um I'd also like to note that um
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
when you read this testimony please
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
remember that these are preschool
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
teachers infant teachers toddler
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
teachers they watch children all day
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
they are not accustomed to conflict
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're not politicians they're not
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
business owners they're not lawyers um
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
the things that were put in front of
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
them were actually very scary and some
 
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
of them thought they were going to be
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
asked to leave or that they were going
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
to lose their jobs one teacher said
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
quote it seemed like an
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
inquisition another teacher said quote I
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
observed the licensers asking the same
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
teacher questions simultaneously
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
interrupting the teacher from
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
supervising of the supervision of the
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
children another teacher said I felt
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
targeted I was questioned repeatedly on
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
the same topic they took my attention
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
away from my students they interfered
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
with a lesson and they completely
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
disregarded that children were asking
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
for my help and continued antagonizing
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
me another said they made me feel
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable by asking me a lot of
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
questions in a corner and by doing so
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
took my eyes away from the children and
 
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.990 align:start position:0%
took my eyes away from the children and
my

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
co-teacher another said they multiple
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
times asked me if I had any concerns
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
regarding the way the center was being
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
run child care providers should not be
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
in fear of licensers sneaking onto their
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
property abusing their teachers being
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
dishonest or either implicitly or
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly declaring that they can quote
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want I ask you to
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
strongly consider passage of HB 230
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
section 4 to begin to make progress on
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
making child care licensing accountable
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
for its actions Against Child Care
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%

rer saying that yeah um good morning to

the committee and thank you for having
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
letting me have the opportunity to speak
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
today um over the last several years
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
starting in
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
17 there were um a number of issues that
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
child care providers tried to uh provide
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
input for the licensing rules which were
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
revised in 2017 and unfortunately I
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
think a lot of those concerns were not
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
heard and they um certainly were not
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
addressed and they have further
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
compounded the crisis that child care
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
programs are in um current day and even
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
further compounded by covid-19 so I'd
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
like to speak today actually in support
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
of all of the um articles of this bill
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
but a few of them I want to speak on
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
specifically so um the number one thing
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
is that we are experiencing a critical
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage especially during
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
covid as other participants have
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
testified that um child care providers
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
and centers are having a difficult time
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining staff that
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
leads is because a number of issues um
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
so one is the
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
qualifications the minimum of nine
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
college credits to be left alone with
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
children um we can't find staff I
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
personally have had an adout since
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
October and I have had one candidate and
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
after offering that person $17 an hour
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
um she said said that she was going to
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
decline because she did not want to have
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
to commit to all of the various pieces
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
of paperwork and requirements such as
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
the eligib the eligibility card the
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
professional development and um you know
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
this person happened to have the
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
education credits but I think it's
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
indicative of the issue that we're
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
facing seven years ago when I opened my
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
program I didn't hire anybody with less
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
than an Associates um but often times my
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
staff had bachelor's and master's
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
degrees unfortunately that Workforce
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist um and is oftentimes not
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
willing to work for the wages that child
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
care programs can provide the average
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
median wage according to the workforce
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
study in 2017 was
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
1079 for a um child care worker and um I
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
would agree that anecdotally the average
 
00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
wages are probably between $9 and
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
$15 but the lack of Workforce is driving
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
up wages and creating a competitive
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
market where essentially um workers can
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
cherry pick and also use it to negotiate
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
and drive up prices so they're saying
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
well this Center offered me $15 what can
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
you do and because programs are show so
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
short staffed they end up having to
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
offer a higher wage in order to fill
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
that opening rather than say I can't
 
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
afford that because we are also required
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
by licensing to have children in a
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
certain number of ratio with those
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
providers and so we are in a critical
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
situation where um I was on a call last
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
week with Early Learning New Hampshire
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
and um I've been on other meetings with
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
providers and we are hearing a
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
resounding cry from Child Care Centers
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
saying they have families that need care
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
but they cannot admit the children to
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
their programs because they do not have
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
the staff to actually work in the center
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
um so I think that you know the
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
qualifications piece of the nine college
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
credits oftentimes when we look at that
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing that um a lot of the
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
espec you know a lot of folks they don't
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
want to have to take the college cours
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
workk they may not be able to um balance
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
that with their schedule they may not
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
have the funds and although Melissa
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
clemant spoke about the um the ECE
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
courses that are able to be paid for
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
100% by the community college system in
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
my experience we have had um applicants
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
for that child care workers and the
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
spots are limited they fill up quickly
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
um often times there's only about 50 to
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
75 spots for them to get that tuition
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
free and so you know that doesn't really
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
create that big of an opportunity
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
for employees to be able to get those
 
01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.309 align:start position:0%
for employees to be able to get those
college

01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
credits also looking at professional
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
development um I have been a huge
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
supporter of reducing the professional
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
development hours not because I don't
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
think that early childhood Educators
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
should um have continuing education or
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't be uh working on
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
their own professional and personal
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
growth but I do feel that often times
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
while many there are many trainings that
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
are free and online staff are already
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
overworked their spread thin especially
 
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
overworked their spread thin especially
during

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
covid they work on average 40 to 50
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
hours they're often times single parents
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
who have uh Child Care issues themselves
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they may not be be able to complete
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
that professional development we also
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
have whether people may or may not want
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge this but it is I do see
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
it as a gender-based issue most of the
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
child care Workforce is women dominated
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
and we're finding that a lot of these
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
employees are in what we call the
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
sandwich generation so not only are they
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
trying to care for their children but
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
also for aging parents and so time is a
 
01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:25.270 align:start position:0%
also for aging parents and so time is a
commodity

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
commodity
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
for them and um they lack that resource
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
in their personal time to be able to
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
work those 450 Plus hours a week and
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
then still have the time um to do the
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
professional development um one of the
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
speakers was talking about nurses and I
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify if you go on to the
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Nursing it's
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
actually um she was speaking of a APRN
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
in active practice and so for for nurses
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea continuing
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
education for an RN is 30 contact hours
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
in 2 years and an LNA is 24 hours in two
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
years I would also ask you to consider
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
the salary and the benefits that these
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
individuals enjoy um and also the
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
schooling that's required for an RN and
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
for public school teachers oftentimes
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
they work nine months out of the year
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
they get full benefits they have
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded salaries and as it was
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out by the speaker often times
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
their salar is double
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
61,7 188 as she quoted oftentimes our
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
employees who are working in child care
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
programs are making 20 to maybe
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
$440,000 a year and that's even at
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
director level so I do think we need to
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
look at when it comes to professional
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
development as representative MC
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
Williams stated that we really need to
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
to take into account um the difference
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
of what they're being asked to do what
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
Their college experience and how much
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to make for a salary um
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
and speaking to the trilemma issue that
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker had brought up in
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
order to have quality providers you have
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
to actually have a Workforce and we do
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
not have that um it has become a huge
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
issue for PRS we sounded the alarm in
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
2017 when we asked uh licensing not to
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
increase hours when we ask them to
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of the eligibility card
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
which is a plastic card that costs $50
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
to show that someone has been
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted all of these things create
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate for the child care
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
programs and there is an administrative
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
cost to us um to try to get people
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
through the door and the fact is is that
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
they can go to places like Target and
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
Walmart as previously mentioned and
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
start at $15 an hour without any of
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
those requirements or barriers um and I
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
do think that that has a significant
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
impact on us so um those are some of the
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
points about those issues and then I
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
also wanted to support Samantha
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
Baldini's testimony um anodally we have
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
heard over and over again that child
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
care programs feel like they've been
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
retal against um as one of the
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislators in a previous hearing had
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
said to um DHHS staff who said that they
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
hadn't heard about retaliation well it
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
stands to reason if your agency is the
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
one that they feel fearful of why would
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
they go to you when um nothing seems to
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
get done I will tell you in my own P
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
personal experience I had a licenser she
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
was not my regular licenser at the time
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
she showed up and um she came in with um
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
the position of when I asked her who she
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
was she pretty much said that she was
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
not new to the program that she was sent
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
to investigate and close programs down
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the first 30 seconds of our
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
conversation so I think you can probably
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
imagine how that set the tone for the
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
rest of the visit so I also support um
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
the looking at um article number four
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
and certainly AR arle number five uh it
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
with terms of creating an independent
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
review board process and I am concerned
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
that while
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS is looking at what unfunded
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
mandates or what the fiscal costs would
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
be for their program um to develop new
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
around um creating the independent
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
hearing review process or looking at the
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
retaliation that they are not looking at
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
the other side which is that often times
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
programs that go forward for the
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process are
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
going in front of from what I understand
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
um they're going in front of the the
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
licensing Chief DHHS legal staff the
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
licenser who gave them the violation and
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
also the um the licenser supervisor now
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
how you can contest a a violation with
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
the very agency
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
um that has given you the violation you
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
know there's not a lot of opportunity
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
for neutrality there and many
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
individuals need to hire attorneys and
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
so it does come at a financial cost to
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
the programs and I think that's been
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
lost um in the licensing rules from 2017
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
to current day is that the state is not
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the financial impact that it
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
has on programs and as a reminder child
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
care is needed for the workforce to be
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
able to have a healthy economy and from
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
2020 from 2019 to 2020 according to our
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fact sheet from Child Care
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
aware we have had approximately a
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
decrease of 10,000 Child Care spaces in
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
our state um and I think that that's
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
indicative of having programs close or
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
not be able to accept children because
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have the workforce and I think
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're really headed for a collapse
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to be an alarmist but I
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a reality and it may be
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
well and great that Vermont and Maine
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts which I don't think is
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
comparable um Massachusetts is not
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
comparable to New Hampshire because of
 
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.829 align:start position:0%
comparable to New Hampshire because of
their

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
salaries but um I do think that New
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to do what's right for
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
our child care providers um so that we
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a Workforce in which uh
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
working class families can send their
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
kids in um and and we're businesses that
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
that is a bottom line and we contribute
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
to the health of the economy as well so
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for taking so long and thank
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak
 
01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
today thank you are there any
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions apparently not very
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for the
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this committee I
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it so my interest in
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
this bill relates to my professional
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
ownership of a soon Tobe opening Child
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
Care Center up in Conway New Hampshire I
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
currently own a gymnastics facility
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
there but also as a Granite State mother
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
of five including twin little girls who
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
are just entering their preschool year
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
so I relate to the sponsor of this bill
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
in that aspect um from both perspectives
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
Ives I have concerns about the
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences this bill could
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
have on the quality of Early Childhood
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
Educators responsible for the care and
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
education of young children in our state
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
as someone currently interviewing
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
candidates for employment I'm
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
experiencing the shortage of qualified
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
applicants many have spoken about today
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
and probably many of your constituents
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
have informed you about in my view the
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
responsible remedy to that problem is
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
offering more resources to potential
 
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
Educators so they can enter the FI field
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
well qualified for the weight of the
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
respon responsibilities they will take
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
on of course there's also the wage issue
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
to address we can't afford to pay
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
quality Educators enough money the
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
remedy is not putting less qualified
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
candidates with this precious and
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
potentially vulnerable population as the
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
sun is just Rising on their educational
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
journey to back up slightly when I
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
decided this Summer that my gymnastics
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
center would add a licensed preschool I
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
was a little stunned to learn all the
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
requirements for each level of
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
professional in this field initially I
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
thought to myself do you mean I can
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
teach a 10-year-old how to do a double
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
backflip which is pretty dangerous and
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
complicated but I can't supervise and
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
help teach toddlers painting playing
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
learning shapes
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
Etc so much of my professional life has
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
been dedicated to providing a safe
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
quality enriching environment to
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
Children through my
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
business still to meet requirements I
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled full-time last semester at nhg
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
to begin earning early childhood
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
education credit so that I can meet the
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
licensing what I learned was that I did
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
have holes in my knowledge despite
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
having worked with since I was 14 years
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
old I read a lot I study a lot I pay a
 
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
lot of attention but I needed those
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
courses even though I didn't know I
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
needed them before I took them I
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
expected it to all be common knowledge
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
but it was not it was essential that I
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
took those courses and had that formal
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
education it will make me a much
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
different director and educator because
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
of the coursework I've taken I would
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee maners to read
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the naeyc Professional
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
Standards and competencies for early
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
childhood education S I think there's a
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
disparity in what we think childhood you
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
know education should look like and what
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
daycare centers sometimes do look like
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire many of
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
these standards are best met with formal
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
coursework I do endorse the existing
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
stepped option where the state allows
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
applicants with three credit hours to
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
enter into a written agreement to
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
complete the remaining six over the
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
course of the year one consideration
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
might be to allow all nine of those cour
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
hours to be completed in the first year
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
if they enroll at first opportunity this
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be far less of a dramatic change
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
to the requirements but give Child Care
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
Centers the larger pool of applicants
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
seeking I do acknowledge that there are
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
a variety of non-public schools and
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
licensed childcare environments that
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
give folks relevant
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
experience this should be considered by
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
licensing where I disagree with the
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
language of this bill is that it cannot
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
substitute for formal cours work in
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
early childhood education they're not
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the same I think it should be used as a
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
means for granting a waiver of
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
experience that then allows the
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
applicant to accumulate the required
 
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
experience hours over the course of
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
their first year of credential
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
employment again that expands the
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
potential Workforce it is been my
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
experience that the department already
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
currently operates with very reasonable
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
clear expectations and a willingness to
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
find a pathway to credentialing
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
applicants that should be in classrooms
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
with children based on their experience
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and education there is no need to lower
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
these standards by
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
Statue finally as a mother of twin
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
little girls with very different needs I
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
have to say even with our current
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
standards in place there are not enough
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
quality preschool environments in our
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
communities I have a child with profound
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
neurological issues and special needs
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
she deserves to be in a preschool
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
environment with Educators who have
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
minimally taken formal coursework
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
related to children with
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
exceptionalities all children deserve
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
for their Educators to have taken
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
coursework related to Preparing an ideal
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
environment and delivering effective
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum they also deserve for their
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
Educators to be truly upto dat with
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
continuing education six hours is
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
insufficient I say that as the person
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
who will be paying my staff to complete
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
their continuing education hours so I
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't take it lightly all children and
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
families deserve quality standards from
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
our state for their and from the centers
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
that take our preschool and child care
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
dollars with a promise to take good care
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
of their children's safety and
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:22.350 align:start position:0%

01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
yes I think the committee uh froze I
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
that in exchange for the preschool and
childcare

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
childcare
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
dollars we should be promising to take
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
good care of children's safy and their
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
educational needs please don't lower the
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
standards for this field we should work
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
together to find other remedies for the
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and wage issues that
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
do acknowledge exist thank you so much

01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
back hello everyone if you can hear me
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
our committee system is suddenly went
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
down so if everyone could just stand by
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
well we try to get it um back up again
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
apparently the the whole complex is
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
having some connection issues yes we
 
01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
figured that out yeah the staff internet
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
connection went out but the guest
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
Internet connection appears to be okay
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I signed off I was booted out up here
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure representative Maguire
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
can be heard perhaps representative Roy
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
could um recognize the next
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
person we have H technical assistance
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
here let's see if if that doesn't work
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can do going forward
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I can take over for my
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%

committee thanks for allowing me to

testify today I'm Jessica Carver I'm a
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
resident of Nottingham New Hampshire I
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
work in a licensed and nationally
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
accredited Early Childhood Program that
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
serves as a lab school for our state and
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
today I am speaking as a professional in
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the field and also as a parent as a I am
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
a consumer of Early Childhood Services
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
my four-year-old daughter is in her last
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
year of programming at the UNH child
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
study and Development Center we've been
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
very fortunate to have her placed in
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
that program since she was about 14
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
weeks old as we both work full-time in
 
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
weeks old as we both work full-time in
my

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
family I do want to briefly bring
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
attention to the comparison of law enfor
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
for ment PD requirements so in July 2020
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire Commission
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement accountability
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
community and transparency recommended
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
to actually increase the mandatory
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
training hours for La officials to 24
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hours by 2020 and that report's actually
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
available on the governor's website I
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
bring it up right now just because it
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
was spoken it was talked about before um
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that that highlights the
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
forward progress that other community
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
public servants are um making with
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
respect to drinking so a little over a
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
year ago I did testify on a similar bill
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
that aimed at reducing professional
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
development requirements for
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the field my stance
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
Still Remains the Same I'm in direct
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of this particular Bill
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the two sections that speak
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
um to the 18 hours per year being
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
reduced to six hours per year and then
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
the associate teacher
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications the last time I testified
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh one State Rep suggested that I was
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
seeking a Utopia that essentially didn't
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
exist and today I still stand here and
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
still believe in that Utopia for young
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
children in our state I I won't waver in
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
my support for actually increasing the
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
standards for educators Early Childhood
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
is far too important of a time period
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
And as a parent I want the best for my
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
child I also believe that every child in
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
this state deserves High highly
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
qualified Educators that understand and
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
know how to support the rapid growth and
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
development that occurs in those first 5
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
years of life um sadly we don't have
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
enough time today to really break down
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
and discuss all the complexities of the
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
current state of Early Childhood in this
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
short um but yet long hearing there are
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
so many issues related to equity and low
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
pay for educators lack of access to
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
Quality Care for families lack of
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
professional requirements and these
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
issues have been around for decades I
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
started working in the field at 18 I'm
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
about to turn 4 next year and sadly we
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
are still talking about the same issues
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
with with very little progress so I do
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
understand the implications of covid but
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and and the impact of that on centers
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
but we're we're still kind of going in
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
circles around the same issue children
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
are our future they are the future of
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
our economy and society and reducing the
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
staff qualifications related to
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
education and PD is only going to
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
further exacerbate the issues that I
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
just mentioned above there's a severe
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
lack of public investment in early
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
childhood compared to public school
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
which has already been spoken about on
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
this call we really need to focus on
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
advocating for investment in the field
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
not reducing qualifications for an
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
already underqualified field I'd really
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
encourage individuals proposing bills
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
such as this to really channel the
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
collective energy to find solutions to
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have above and engage
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
with experts in the field experts that
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
understand and know Child Development
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
and we should really start talking about
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
career Pathways for people in the field
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
Financial incentives to support
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
Professionals in programs that are
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
already struggling to make ends meet I'm
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to close with a quote from JFK
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
quote children are the world's most
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
valuable resource and its best hope for
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
the future end quote I respectfully urge
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
everyone to really stop undervaluing the
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
care and education of young children we
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
can't ignore this our children deserve
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
more and um I really appreciate that you
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
all listen to My Testimony today thank
 
01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:54.070 align:start position:0%

are there any questions from the
 
01:24:59.109 --> 01:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
committee I just wanted
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
Cowell

01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
call thank you how do you do nice to
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
meet you all I'm uh Jackie Cowell from
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
Early Learning New Hampshire I'll be
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
very brief our organization um signed up
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
as neutral we are a Statewide um
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
organization uh where we have an we're
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
an association many childcare uh and
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
Head Start programs are our members and
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know folks are on both sides of this
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of you know um making it
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
realistic and having the right number of
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
hours so that you can actually hire
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
staff and then also not bringing it down
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
because of what you've heard testimony
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
around that really you know having a
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
qualified staff is important and a
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
stable staff so you know I think we are
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
definitely um in support of number five
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
of of having that study committee look
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
at an an appeals process that might have
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
like a peer reviewed like other
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
Industries um in ter we think that's a
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
terrific thing but just really
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
quickly it really in those first five
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
years where a lot of children there's
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
over um about three quarters of children
 
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
are in some kind of a Child Care Program
 
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
right now as they're because their
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
parents are working so it's it's doing
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
two things it's supporting the parents
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
ability to work but it's also shaping
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
the workforce of tomorrow uh you may not
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
realize that if you do the math a child
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
can actually spend more hours in child
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
care before they enter public school
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
then they will their whole public school
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
from kindergarten to 12th grade
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
including lunch and recess because again
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
moms and dads are working they'll drop
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
off the child they'll commute they'll
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
work they'll commute back those hours
 
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
add up and that's the time of really
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
important Child Development so Child
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
Care is really important and having
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
great teachers is really important at
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
the same time talking about Vermont and
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine they have a lot
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
of different Investments not just a
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
different minimum wage they really
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
invest in helping those programs meet
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
those standards so I iterate what others
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
have said that qualified and stable
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
staff is critical to running good child
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
care programs but it takes dollars
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
because right now it's the parents who
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
are are paying for this mostly it's most
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the one of the reasons you have low
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
salaries is because it's the parents who
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
pay for it and they're just starting off
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
in their careers too it can often cost
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
as much as sending your child to um to
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
college to you know Public public
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
colleges and they're just starting off
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
in their career they're not 20 years
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
into their career when they're paying
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
for this so there's a saying teachers
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
can't afford to stay parents can't
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
afford to pay they there's got to be a
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
better way so I really thank you for
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
turning your focus on this I'm I like
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
Jessica and others have been doing this
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
for for me it's been 31 years here in
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm sorry that we're not
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
better off in terms of having a child
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
care system that allows you to hire
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
great people and keep great people and
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
have parents be able to afford it but
 
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sorry we're still talking about
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
it I am glad we're still talking about
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
it and I thank you for this thank you
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.590 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the

director at Mirch daycare service and
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
blueberry Express Daycare in Pittsfield
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
in conquered um I wanted to speak out in
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I understand my
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues and their concerns about
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
quality of staff and um I wanted to just
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of background of how
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
we got into this mess to begin with um
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
in several years ago the New Hampshire
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
defunded um The Early Childhood programs
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
in high school technical schools and the
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
effect the ripple effect that's had on
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
the career path of Early Childhood
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
Educators in New Hampshire is astounding
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
so when that was defunded although they
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
did overturn that decision by the time
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
they overturned it the damage had been
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
done and a lot of these programs had
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
been dismantled at marac Valley daycare
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
service I have 30% of my staff who
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
started in the early childhood programs
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
in Tech schools and high schools and
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
that formed a career path where you
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
would have these two years programs you
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
would go on to your community college
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
and receive some college credits and you
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
were really well set up for a career in
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
early childhood education and that path
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't really exist anymore and
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately now when someone comes to
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
me saying you know I'm interested in
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
early childhood education I'd like to
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
start out I like working with kids what
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
I have to tell them is okay you can work
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
here you can't ever be you can't be
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
alone with kids until you get college
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
credits I'm going to pay you $12 an hour
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
and in your free time you're going to
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
have to go to school or they can go to
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
Target and make $15 an hour and do
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they'd like in their free time
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we are losing out on
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
that I would like nothing better than to
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
hire people who have college credits I
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
would it would fill my heart with joy
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
but they are not out there to hire and
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
my hands are tied I don't see any
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
benefit to Early Childhood programs not
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
existing anymore because we just don't
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
have a Workforce something really has to
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
it looks like we' Roy we've lost the
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee room again yes we've lost the
 
01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.270 align:start position:0%

committee

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
room oh can they hear us miss
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%

hear us because he's on his device but I
 
01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
don't representative Roy can you hear
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%

tell if we just tell Miss bartard or H
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
to just wait for a moment until I do
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
have a question for her yeah I have
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
contacted it um okay let's sit tight
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
right let's sit tight and um I know that
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's again it's systemwide so
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard for them to be everywhere at
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
once they're outages in the L in every
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%

01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like we have um the committee
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
room back in
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%

right representative Shu if you can hear
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
me ask your question yes yes thank you
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to ask um Miss barter
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
she had
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I believe the year that the
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
high school and technical school
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
programs were defunded and I didn't
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
catch the year
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative I don't have
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
that year I um I could certainly get it
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
for you but I believe it was eight years
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
ago and um there was a lot of activism
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
in the field to reinstate those programs
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
they are an important part of our career
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
path but by the time it was re by the
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
time it was reversed it was too late
 
01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.430 align:start position:0%
time it was reversed it was too late
thank

01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%

much

01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:51.800 align:start position:0%

um chair um Maguire I did have a
 
01:37:04.199 --> 01:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
um chair um Maguire I did have a
question

01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
of yes
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
Miss please ask your question thank you
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
U Miss barter with the reinstatement of
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
these programs these early childhood
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
education in technical schools well
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
first of all are they back in operation
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
and have they
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
helped um they're not most of them are
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
not back in operation so it created this
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
sort of funny ripple effect where the
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education chose to defund
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
these programs um and and they were
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
dismantled relatively quickly and it
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually it happened at Kind of a Funny
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
time um we found out in April of the
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
school year they would not be returning
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the fall and so there was kind of a
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
Mad scramble
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
to um change the funding and kind of
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
work out what would be funded instead
 
01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
and they ended up funding teacher
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
preparation programs which were really
 
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
for K through 12 and so unfortunately
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
even though the Department of Education
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
did reverse and say yes you can in fact
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
have early education programs that will
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
be funded through the Department of
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
Education through Perkins funding um all
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
by that point most high schools had
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
already dismantled their um lab schools
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
their I mean it was just too late gotten
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
rid of their
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
staff thank you certainly representative
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh thank you chair um and thank
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh you did
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
talk about uh closing of some of the uh
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh high schools and stuff like that but
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
how does your industry feel about a
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
student that continued with their
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
education uh perhaps uh at the Technical
 
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
College not really getting a degree but
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
taking a certificate program in such a
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
on this subject uh would they be uh you
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
know would that make them more
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
attractive for
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
higher yes certainly they would but
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately part of the ripple effect
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
of the high school programs is that many
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
schools no long many higher education
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
institutions no longer have Early
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
Childhood programs either I believe
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
Plymouth has gotten rid of theirs Rivier
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
has gotten rid of theirs it is just not
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
an attractive career for young people
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
right now unfortunately um I would like
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
to State though that the state of New
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our colleagues at Childcare
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
licensing and at DHHS have several
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives that they have proposed to
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
help fix this problem um apprenticeships
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
the teach program um and they're great
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
programs I think we're really excited
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
about them they're going to take a long
 
01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
time to implement and so really what we
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
need is a bridge until we get to the
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
point where some of these programs can
 
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
be implemented I I don't know if the if
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the legislators would consider a if they
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
really can't support this 100% maybe
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
sunsetting this giving us five or six
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
years for a little bit of recovery
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
before these programs could um come back
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
strong would be a huge
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Miss barter
 
01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.830 align:start position:0%

learning programs while well intentioned
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
we believe sections of hp230 are a
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
threat to the high quality of care our
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
children deserve which is why I'm
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this Bill
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood educators are
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for the care and education
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
of our youngest citizens uh while they
 
01:41:23.070 --> 01:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
provide an essential service to Working
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
Families and help shape the leaders of
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they are routinely undervalued
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
hp230 seeks to answer this shameful
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
undervaluing of teachers by lowering the
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
bar for continuing education hours
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
required of childcare employees by 23s
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
from 18 hours annually to six hours
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
annually Early Childhood Educators that
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
I've worked closely with in my role
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
understand that their jobs have not
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
gotten easier but more difficult as our
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
state copes with multiple crises
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
impacting children including the opioid
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
epidemic and the covid-19
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic more children are coming into
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
their care with adverse childhood
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
experiences or Aces associated with the
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
aforementioned crisis I believe that
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
that means we should um child care
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
providers should be supported by the
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
state with more resources and training
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
to help them provide highquality care
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
answering these crises by diminishing
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
standards of care would be a grave
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
mistake that would negatively impact
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
generations of granite Staters even
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
setting Public Health crisis aside the
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
quality of care of our children is a
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
direct reflection of the competence of
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
the Early Childhood educator and we
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
should not consider compromising the
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our children under
 
01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.189 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our children under
any

01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances additionally hp230 aims to
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
loosen child safety regulation by
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
allowing Child Care programs that have
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
been found by the state to pose a threat
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the health or safety of the children
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
in their care to continue operating
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
during the pendency of any proceeding
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
for the review of of the decision of the
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
department unless explicitly ordered to
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
close as a representative of an
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
organization that prioritizes children's
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
health and safety above all else I
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
oppose any law which would allow our
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
children to remain in an environment
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is potentially unsafe um so in
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion I urge members of this
 
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
legislate on hp230 as it's written thank
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
mine and others testimony today I have

01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%

none good
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%

Ranos thank you can you hear me okay yes
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you wonderful thank you so much
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
for taking time to hear my testimony
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
this morning in opposition to section
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
two and three on HB 230 my name is Lisa
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
rampus I am a resident of Allenstown and
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
I have been in the field of Early
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
Childhood for over 25 years as a teacher
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
and administrator a trainer and mentor
 
01:44:03.629 --> 01:44:03.639 align:start position:0%
and as a college faculty member in all
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
of my years in the field one trend has
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
remained consistent and that is that
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
teachers in the field face face an
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
uphill battle from day one they are not
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
viewed as teachers unless they teach in
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
K to2 schools they are inadequately paid
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
and they are ill equipped for their role
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
in many ways not only are their minimal
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
standards required to become a teacher
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
unlike the professions that are being
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
compared to Early Childhood in this bill
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
but programs themselves are not set up
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
in a way to provide the needed supports
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
to their teachers directors often have
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
to spend time themselves in classrooms
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
covering for staff shortages or breaks
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the day and they too often
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
are not fully prepared for their role as
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
many programs seek someone with
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
education to meet the minimal
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
requirements but rarely are able to seek
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
someone whose leadership or
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
Administration experience in the field
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
this lack of experience impacts our
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
teachers efficacy with young children
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
while this might seem as a long-winded
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps disconnected testimony the
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to make is that
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
individuals need more training not less
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
they need coaching and opportunities to
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
engage in Knowledge and Skills that
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
align with an action plan they can
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
Implement with the support of their
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
leadership who can assist with resources
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
and modeling as needed as Educators we
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
teach children to be lifelong Learners
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
and it's critical that we are learning
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
right along with them as new science
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
comes out regularly about the impact
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
that adults have on young children 's
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
brain development social emotional
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
health and their ability to be
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
successful in later
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
years this bill could increase the
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
negative effects on children by allowing
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
even less trained and experienced people
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for young children the
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
children of New Hampshire deserve to be
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
in high quality programs with educated
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
and experienced teachers there's a
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
plethora of research that cannot be
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
ignored that that proves this yet there
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
is continued effort to decrease these
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
requirements it takes a significant
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
investment from our state to bring this
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
to fruition
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
I would be remiss if I did not also
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that all of this is true
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
without the added strain of the pandemic
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
which has placed incredible pressures on
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
programs and many if not all have
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
struggled with staffing issues related
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
to illness quarantine and their own
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
family commitments such as supporting
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
remote learning for school age children
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
many people are trying to keep their
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
doors open and this impacts their
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
livelihood while this has been a
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
Monumental challenge decreasing the
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for a person to be able to
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
work with young children is unacceptable
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
I urge you to consider the long-term
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
impact that these changes would have and
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
I believe as an expert in my field would
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to Children it takes a
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
seasoned teacher to understand and
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
implement the best strategies when faced
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
with challenging behaviors that may be
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
exhibited from children as they try to
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
make sense of things that cannot be
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
easily explained like the pandemic we
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
need to provide more support to these
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
programs consider Workforce Pathways and
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the many successful
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
strategies that are already in use
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
across our state and make them available
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
to all so that the children of New
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can Thrive and be successful

01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the authority of the
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshall to Grant an
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
exemption from fire code requirements to
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
recovery houses this fall I chaed the
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee to study State and Municipal
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
Authority governing recovery housing I
 
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
see representative Pearson is here as
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
well he was part of that committee this
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee recommended that legislation
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
be submitted to mirror the amended
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
version of HB 311 from the previous
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
session that easily passed the house but
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
died as part of a large omnus bill at
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
the end of last session the committee
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
also recommended that the legislation
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
include a clear definition for Recovery
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
housing that is what HB 377 does a
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
recovery house or Sober Sober Living
 
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
home as they're sometimes call offers
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
those in recovery from substance abuse a
 
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
bridge between impatient rehab and
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
living on their own in New Hampshire
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
there are some great facilities working
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
to Aid those in recovery providing rules
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
structure requiring ongoing therapy and
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
have a drug-free environment they are
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
crucial in the road to recovery New
 
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs recovery homes to
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
continue to operate in our communities
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
and to help people to succeed in
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
recovery this legislation is no way
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
designed to reduce or eliminate true
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
recovery or Sober Living homes which are
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
valuable and necessary to our
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
communities in Manchester and other
 
01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities however we have found
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
that there are others who are simply
 
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of those in recovery
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
there are those who are using the
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%

doing so for greater profits
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters responding to overdoses at

01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
designation to circumvent Life Safety
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%

are not being protected this bill does
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
not interfere with that act as it is a

permissive piece of legislation allowing
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
true recovery homes to operate under
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
less stringent regulations than boarding
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
and rooming houses this is necessary as
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
there is a shortage of true recovery
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire and we need to
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
help these facilities find a path to
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
safely operate I am aware that great
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
work is being done on voluntary
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
certifications but it is not going to
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
stop others from using the name to solve
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
life safety issues this Bill defines
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
recovery housing so that those using the
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
title of recovery house or sober living
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
home in order to circumvent those safety
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
codes and making a profit at the expense
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the health and safety of others can
 
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
easily be detected and determined to not
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
be a recovery home ask that you vote
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill to help
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
protect those in recovery and give them
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
a true chance at recovery as well as to
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%

themselves in dangerous situations due
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%

paresi it's my privilege to serve as
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
your State Fire Marshall and uh House
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 377 as you know would create a
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
statute that allows our office to Grant
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
recovery residences an exemption to
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
certain requirements of the state fire
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
code this exemption may be granted under
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
the following conditions that they are
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the voluntary
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
registry or they are certified by New
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire core and in addition they
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
would have to meet a list of safety
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and fire the fire
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
department would have access for
 
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.629 align:start position:0%
department would have access for
inspection

01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
annually as uh as many of you are aware
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've been working together with local
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
fire departments in particular the
 
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire department as well as
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
numerous stakeholders in the recovery
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
community and DHHS for a number of years
 
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
now um trying to find a solution to the
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
issues that surround balancing Fire and
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Life Safety with reasonable inexpensive
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
access to recovery residences it is not
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
lost on us uh those of us that are in
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
fire service that the number of Overdose
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
deaths in New Hampshire far exceed the
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
number of deaths that occur in
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
residential structures here in our state
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
while we anxious to help in reducing the
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
number of Overdose deaths we certainly
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to tip the scales the other
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
way therefore we urge caution to those
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
involved in this issue to ensure safety
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
in all aspects the New Hampshire State
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshals office supports this bill
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons one it
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
standardizes the way our state handles
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
recovery residences from a fire safety
 
01:56:44.069 --> 01:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
perspective two it may reduce the number
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
of not in my backyard issues that arise
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
because the law will be clear number
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
three it it strikes a reasonable balance
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
between life safety and access to
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
recovery residences four it leverages
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure such as New
 
01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:00.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire core and the variance process
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
outlined in safe c6000 and finally it
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
shines a bright light and it is
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
transparent relative to the extent of
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
compromise that we are willing to give
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
and it allows the general court an
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide if it's
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the State Fire Marshall
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
to be issuing an exception under these
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
broad conditions appreciate the
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and I would add
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%

01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%

side by side with this issue and
 
01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:35.719 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire core and even
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
though we may differ on the particulars
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
of this of this bill uh I do believe
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
that uh everyone in this issue has the
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
the safety and well-being of those in
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
recovery and substance use disc disorder
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%

questions thank you are there questions
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee yes I have a
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
question yes representative O'Brien was
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
first no
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem uh thank you uh to the chair and

thank you Chief good to see you again
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill on the first page uh line 20
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
which is say basement's Living Spaces
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
shall have an exit uh directly the uh
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
grade and then it says uh at least one
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh the next J farther down one Escape
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
window in each sleeping area and in your
 
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:35.709 align:start position:0%
window in each sleeping area and in your
familiar

01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
arity to uh basements some of the
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
windows aren't small so uh are small and
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
not really can uh be used for means of
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh agress does this go
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
with the existing fire cold La as far as
 
01:58:59.229 --> 01:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.149 --> 01:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
basement thank you for the question
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien and uh and yes it
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
it does and you know what we want to
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
avoid is having someone in a basement uh
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
sleeping area essentially behind a
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
closed door having a fire outside of
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
that uh room and then not having any way
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
to escape so um we need to they need to
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
have a second means of erress so the the
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
window out of the sleeping area sleeping
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
room is is uh is important to us and it
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
does correspond with uh with the
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
existing uh code okay thank
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so uh Fire
 
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
Marshall good very good uh to see you
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
this morning or not to see you but to
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
hear you um and I'm wondering with
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
regard to the annual inspection uh uh
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph of your letter uh I read your
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of your letter and agree with
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
it but uh to me it doesn't strike me
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that it should say at least
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
annually I I'm I'm fearful that we may
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
get in a situation if we say annually
 
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that that will be insufficient
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh would you be amendable to uh
 
02:00:21.159 --> 02:00:24.350 align:start position:0%
uh would you be amendable to uh
rewarding

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and certainly you
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
know at least annually is fine with us
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
um we just we were cautious to make sure
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not uh creating a 28a issue
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and saying the fire departments must
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
inspect but if uh as long as access is
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh permitted you know at least annually
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine with us followup follow up
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you um so Marshall uh the
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
the thing is that you know uh that the
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
people who are who are trying to comply
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
will do everything they can to keep
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
complying uh but the degree that we say
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
annually uh the people who may be
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
inclined to slip shot stuff I I know
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're not going to permit anybody who's
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
clearly trying to skirt the law and and
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
and abuse the the the provision s for
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
their own Advantage without regard for
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
the recovery aspect uh they're bad
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
actors and you're going to shut them
 
02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
down but I just think that uh that
 
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
neglectful have question representative
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
leus um thank you and thank you for
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking the question we've Gott a letter
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
from NH core and there's uh one sentence
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
in there that I'm concerned about uh it
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
said many of the requirements appear to
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
exceed the applicable standards of
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
existing state law for dwellings um
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
please I'd be happy to representative
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I I I I
 
02:02:06.069 --> 02:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for um for the
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
executive director Kim Bach but um but I
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
think what what they are referring to
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is that in existing one and two
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
family dwellings in our state right now
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
um sprinkler sprinklers are not required
 
02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
and uh and in in fact some of these
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
other uh things that we list out here
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
are not required either uh there is no
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh requirement for fire drills there's
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
no requirement for uh you know a
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
properly maintained cooking appliance uh
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
no smoking you know obviously we don't
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
regulate those things in one two family
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
dwelling so I believe that's what she is
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
um you know likely or the the NH core is
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
referring to um um but we don't
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily view these uh you know of
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
course depending on the occupancy we
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily view these as as
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
single family dwellings we in some cases
 
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
view them as apartment buildings we may
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
view them as congregate living we may
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
view them as lodging and rooming you
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
know depending on the construction of
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
the building the number of folks that
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
are living there um in almost all cases
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
um either beds or rooms are being uh
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
rented out um and money is being
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
exchanged so um you know I think that's
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
probably why she is saying that and I I
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with the statement that
 
02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
certainly there are things here that are
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh over and above that but please don't
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
interpret what she says she'll be
 
02:03:39.199 --> 02:03:40.310 align:start position:0%
interpret what she says she'll be
speaking

02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
next just quick followup follow and and
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know does the uh do you
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
basically see a need for every one of
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
these requirements for this to be
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
you uh well if we are going to this is
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
only if we are going to make an
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
exemption from the fire code so there
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
may be times when there isn't an
 
02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
exemption that's necessary in which case
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't apply but if
 
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant is is coming to us looking
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
for a reasonable
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
accommodation um or a an exemption uh
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
from uh a sprinkler system for instance
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
then it's our job
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
to um look at what equivalencies could
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
be put in place to um not to to allow
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
them to operate without a sprinkler
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
system and so that's why we've put in a
 
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
number of things that we feel is if if
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
if these particular things are in place
 
02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and we're able to verify
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
them on a at least an annual basis then
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
yes we we believe that um this this is
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
these are necessary okay thank
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
you okay other
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%

02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
of the committee um thank you for your
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
your time to speak about this issue I'm
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
Kim boach and I'm the executive director
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Coalition of
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
recovery residences and I'll refer to
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
that as NH core to make it easier for me
 
02:05:37.390 --> 02:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak in opposition of
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 377 on behalf of people who
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
live in recovery residences in New
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we appreciate the work that
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
has been done on this and the and the
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
work of the sponsors F Marshall PRI and
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
town fire department as as Fire Marshall
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
pzy said we're all concerned about the
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
safety of people who live in recovery
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
homes however NH core opposes HB 377
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
because one the Fire Marshall already
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
has the power to Grant
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions under current state laws and
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
two because on its face HP 377 is
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so let me give you a
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about NH core
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're a very young organization that has
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
been certifying recovery residences meet
 
02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:26.189 align:start position:0%
been certifying recovery residences meet
a

02:06:26.189 --> 02:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
national um minimum nationally
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
recognized standard of operation and
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
Care we've been operating that for about
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
18 months when this legislation began
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
under previous House Bill 311 NH core
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
was a Grassroots organization that was
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
just coming together we've now grown
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
grown into a full nonprofit corporation
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
and have certified 18 houses in New New
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire Corp was
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
appointed by the commissioner of DHHS as
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
the organization to certify recovery
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
residences according to those nationally
 
02:06:58.910 --> 02:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
accepted best practice standards
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
established by the National Association
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
of recovery residences also known as
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
Nar certification is a really rigorous
 
02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
process that starts with a review of all
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
the corporate documents and all house
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures the national
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
standards set best practice guidelines
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the person in
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
recovery all obligations and
 
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for both the operator
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the resident must be clearly laid
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%

that they were impressed and reassured

by our list of of

02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 377 the bill is unnecessary
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
because the State Firearm Marshal
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
already has the ability to Grant the
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions provided for in this bill and
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the bill separates out a subset of a
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%

it it's your organization is one of the
 
02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.559 align:start position:0%
options not the only way to be
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
house I'm sorry could you repeat
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
that you said that this discriminates
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
against Discovery houses certified by
 
02:10:34.559 --> 02:10:35.510 align:start position:0%

your
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
organization however it discriminates
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
against people in
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
recovery it sections out as a a subset
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
of people in recovery housing and that
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
subset is people people that are either
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
on the registry with the state or they
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%

yes Christin Wellington yes
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
yourself good morning Madam chair and uh
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
members of this committee um I think
 
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
Kim's covered our basic concerns really
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
well I I just wanted to um expound a
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
little bit on the protections that the
 
02:11:53.069 --> 02:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
Ada and the federal fair housing act um
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
provide the Fair Housing Act I'm going
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
to focus in on um
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
protects uh members of of uh classes um
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
by requiring neutral laws applied
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
neutrally but the proposed legislation
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
specifically targets housing for members
 
02:12:15.149 --> 02:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
of a protected class group as as Kim has
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
said and that is racially discriminatory
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
and it it it's impermissible under the
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
law um in 1988 the US Congress added
 
02:12:28.589 --> 02:12:28.599 align:start position:0%
disability as a protected class to the
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
federal fair housing act and in its
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
discussions and in its legislative
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
intent it was particularly concerned
 
02:12:39.149 --> 02:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
about protections applied to congregate
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
housing it was already in 1988 um a
 
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
potential worry for them and so that
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's specific language in their um
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
in their deliberations about protecting
 
02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
people that were living in in congregate
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
housing um in 2016 um the US Department
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
of Justice and um Housing and Urban
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
Development issued guidance um for uh
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
land use uh and they specifically talked
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
about um group homes and that I think at
 
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
the time they were calling them sober
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
homes and we differentiate ourselves a
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
bit from being a sober home
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
but that that they were uh indeed
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
included in the the land use protections
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
so um there's this idea that many times
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh well-intentioned
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um laws and ordinances and regulations
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
um Target protected class groups based
 
02:13:40.239 --> 02:13:41.629 align:start position:0%
um Target protected class groups based
on

02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
stereotypes um we do feel that the body
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
of laws in New Hampshire both state and
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
in local um are sufficient to address
 
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
the legitimate concerns of our
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
governmental structures for Bad actors
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
in in the field people that are taking
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
advantage people that are not um
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
complying with basic uh uh health and
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
safety laws um that there's there's
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
also um the fact that recovery homes um
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
span is is uh Fire Marshall paresi me
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned different kinds of residenti
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
residences so um this isn't a one um
 
02:14:30.669 --> 02:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
size fits all each each U particular
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
home um may be subject to different
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
requirements but many should be
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
considered as single family dwellings
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
and that's clear in the case law and
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we oppose this this statute
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
it targets a protected class group and
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's you know just facially
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:49.790 align:start position:0%
it's you know just facially
discriminatory

02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%

02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.470 align:start position:0%
 
years

02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you chair um I'm going to
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
give you the example you mentioned
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination and it kind of tweaked me
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
a bit so I'm going to give you the
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
example if I lived in an unattached
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
single family home uh by the fire code I
 
02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
can choose not to have any type of uh
 
02:15:46.549 --> 02:15:46.559 align:start position:0%
smoke detector or sprinkler system in my
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
dwelling although I would possibly
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from my homeowners insurance
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
however if I was Liv living in an
 
02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.069 align:start position:0%
however if I was Liv living in an
attached

02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
attached
 
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
duplex uh I am required to have at least
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
smoke detectors in my dwelling and the
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
reason is the actions of one of the
 
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
neighbor next door to me could have
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on myself and my family
 
02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
so by having this how do you really say
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
that it's discriminatory because where
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
you have unrelated type of people living
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
in a in a communal type of uh
 
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
environment uh and something should go
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
wrong uh to me this really enhances
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
their own personal safety going back to
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh like in the duplex situation can you
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh tell us tell me how you feel about
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
that yes it the the thing that we're
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
focusing in on is neutral laws U applied
 
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
neutrally are not discriminatory but
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
when you select out a group of people
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
who are protected by anti-discrimination
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
laws and say and for you you're going to
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
get special um uh laws and rules uh that
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
that require you to do different things
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
um Fire Marshall paresi did mention that
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um in this proposed legislation in
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
exchange for uh an exemption from in
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
installing a sprinkler system um the
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
operator would have to agree to several
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
conditions that are not required under
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
existing state law that wouldn't be
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
required for another non-recovery home
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
situation that was that was similarly
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
situated except for the fact that they
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
weren't recovery homes so singling out
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
recovery homes for for more uh
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement more regulations is the
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%

at my first meeting I was elected
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and last Friday I was
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%

organizations I charged my commission
 
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
with identifying various deaf and heart
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
of hearing needs that could either
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
become proposed legislation or
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions to departments for changes
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
02:26:20.269 --> 02:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
one item identified was the need for
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
various changes to be made to the laws
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
governing American Sign Language
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%

professional association for these folks
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
was consulted so that our language could
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
be brought into Conformity with their
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
language and the language of various
 
02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.309 align:start position:0%

State
 
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
associations a bill was presented to the
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislature last year the house passed
 
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
it but as we know with many other good
 
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
bills it didn't make it through the
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
Senate process that bill with minor
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
changes is the one before you
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
today many of the changes are minor we
 
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
have added the term de blind
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrating our recognition of this
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
subgroup within the deaf and heart of

hearing Community names of various deaf
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%

02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
organizations that are no longer in ex
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
existance are to be removed from the
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
law As We examined the State sign
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
language interpretation in New Hampshire
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
were two things we wanted to do to
 
02:27:33.309 --> 02:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
strike a balance on the one hand we
 
02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to toughen up the response to
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
licensed interpreters who violate the
 
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
code of professional conduct there is
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
already suspension or loss of license we
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
wish to ask add an
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
administrative fee or penalty but on the
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
other hand we wanted to provide a
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
process for those who make many many
 
02:27:59.550 --> 02:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
mistakes but not the kind of mistakes
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
which rise to the level of a violation
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the code of professional conduct the
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
language I wrote in the bill would allow
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
for remedial action and not punitive
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
action in these cases
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
finally we recommend that certif IED
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
credential interpreters be used when
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
possible but we know that in some cases
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
available in those cases we certainly
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
make allowance that individuals who are
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
not yet certified or credentials could
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
be used in such situations where they're
 
02:28:38.269 --> 02:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
needed provided they do not present
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
themselves as being credentialed and
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
certainly that volunteer signing the
 
02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
1115 mass for Deaf parishioners would
 
02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
not have to have a license so that's my
 
02:28:53.710 --> 02:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
bill and I would be happy to take any
 
02:29:00.750 --> 02:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.309 align:start position:0%

overview um if a student is in school

and does have uh a license uh uh
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
interpreter well somebody that can do
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
sign language but in the situation of
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
the teacher or and or the parah who
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
complements what the student is learning
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
this does not affect them am I correct

02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for allowing
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
me to speak today my name is jod lefor
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I was part of the committee that
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Mark Pearson
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
that is to draft this proposal I did
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
submit some written testimony so I will
 
02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
try to keep my oral um testimony brief
 
02:30:23.389 --> 02:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of this
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill as repres representative Pearson
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
had mentioned we did have a proposal on
 
02:30:30.030 --> 02:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
the table last year that passed through
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee but with all the craziness
 
02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
that happened last year it did not pass
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
through the full legislature this may
 
02:30:37.469 --> 02:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
have been a good thing since I believe
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
that we have created a better proposal
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
than we had last year some of the
 
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
changes are simple corrections as he
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that need to be made While
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
others are more systemic that we believe
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
will strengthen the license law allowing
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
the system to better meet the needs of
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
all those involved some of those
 
02:30:54.429 --> 02:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
highlights are the critical shortage
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
exemption proposed in 326
 
02:31:00.190 --> 02:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
i7 for qualified individuals that are
 
02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
not licensed perhaps from outside of New
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but could meet the need the
 
02:31:07.269 --> 02:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
pool of licensed interpreters cannot
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
providing a chance for people to get the
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
most appropriate match without needing
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
to go through the waiver
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
process speaking of the waiver also in
 
02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
326 i7 bringing interpreters working
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
under a waiver under the jurisdiction of
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
the license board gives the recipient of
 
02:31:23.269 --> 02:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
services a safety net in case an
 
02:31:25.469 --> 02:31:25.479 align:start position:0%
egregious error is made by the waved
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
interpreter the grievance procedure
 
02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
proposed change in 326
 
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
I15 is what re in regards to an when
 
02:31:35.790 --> 02:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
there's an issue between the deaf deaf
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
blind person and The
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
Interpreter and often the grievance
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
procedure is too difficult to navigate
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
that person may choose not to use that
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
interpreter again resulting in left
 
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
serve is available and The Interpreter
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
may go on with a behavior without
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
knowing it was an issue and not knowing
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be corrected even though
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
mediation has always been an option in
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
the rules our hope is that allowing this
 
02:31:59.550 --> 02:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
to happen without the burden of a formal
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
hearing will make the system more
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
accessible and more
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
effective I also would like to pass
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%

excellent um good morning members of the
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%

um my name is Jules good I am a late
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
deaf person living in New Hampshire and
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm also here on behalf of my employer
 
02:32:52.269 --> 02:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
Northeast Sten heart of hearing
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
services um I am absolutely in support
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
of this bill I think it's great to be
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
honing in on um the you know the
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
processes for lure and everything having
 
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
to do with that for the interpreters in
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
our state I think holding them to a high
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
standard is really great because um I've
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
seen my fair share of not so great
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
interpreters um and so it's great to be
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
um holding everybody to a standard that
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
is really going to result in the best um
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
and most accurate communication for deaf
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
people like me um one thing that I
 
02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to um start my video I can do
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
that hi one thing that I wanted to um
 
02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:38.359 align:start position:0%

02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of organizations

02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
muchi you uh don't absolutely need to
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
ask every person a question but you're
 
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
recognized for
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
one well thank you madam chair so um I I
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
have a question as a former uh
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
professional interpreter and and uh and
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
and uh translator I know that mistakes
 
02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
can be made I've seen examples of work
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
done by people who are not competent uh
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
and they're pretty disastrous uh so I'm
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how do you deal with this
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
situation because unless you have
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
somebody listening to the sign language
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
interpreter uh and observing and seeing
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
mistakes being made how are you going to
 
02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
know unless there's certain obvious
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
situations but how are you going to know
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the person is not competent
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
about are you asking me yes oh okay
 
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I was not sure um yeah that's a
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
great question um so as a deaf person um
 
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
I guess it depends on the situation that
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'm in um so sometimes what will happen
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
is I can see I mean I tend to voice for
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
myself so I don't deal with this a lot
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
um but if I am signing and I see that
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
The Interpreter has said misrepresented
 
02:36:24.510 --> 02:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
something um that I was signing to them
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
and I catch it in the captions I'll call
 
02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
them out on it um and ask them to
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
correct me um but I think um in
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
general it it can be hard um
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
to um to identify like every single
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
error if you're the only person in the
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
room who knows sign language and you
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
can't hear what's going on so you have
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to compare it to I do think in
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
my experience what tends to happen is um
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're only really concerned
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
when there's a pattern of behavior and
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
mistakes um from interpreters and that
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
news gets around quickly in the deaf
 
02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
Community um you know we know which
 
02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
interpreters we want and which ones we
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
will take as a last resort um to put it
 
02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
in a respectful way um and so it is kind
 
02:37:16.349 --> 02:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
of a matter of
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
um of seeing a repeated pattern of
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
mistakes um rather than you know trying
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
to catch somebody making one small
 
02:37:28.590 --> 02:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
mistake if that makes
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%

when you're far back but it's still a
 
03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
when you're far back but it's still a
problem

03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%

somebody the other day input volume was
 
03:28:30.910 --> 03:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
too high and it came up they cut the
 
03:28:32.429 --> 03:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
input volume then they were they were
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
could be understood that's another issue
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
too that can be there you know go to
 
03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:37.710 align:start position:0%

settings yeah I finally got one of these
 
03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
it good to see a lot of familiar
 
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%

House Bill 345 for the record I'm
 
03:29:21.670 --> 03:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jerry kerk I represent
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
Carol County District 3 this bill is a
 
03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
product of the 2019 mushroom foraging
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
commission which was charged to study
 
03:29:31.630 --> 03:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
developing a system for licensing
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who forage for wild
 
03:29:35.950 --> 03:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
mushrooms with the intent to sell them
 
03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
to restaurant suppliers or at farmers
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
markets now the issue is that without
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill restaurants grocery
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
stores farmers markets and farm stands
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
will not be allowed to sell or serve
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms in New Hampshire the
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that according to the
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
2017 us food code in order for a food
 
03:29:58.150 --> 03:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
service establishment to serve or sell
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
while de harvested mushrooms in the US
 
03:30:03.309 --> 03:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
they must be approved to do so by a
 
03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority with jurisdiction
 
03:30:08.070 --> 03:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
over the food establishment and that
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
approval requires the appropriate
 
03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
identification of the Wild mushrooms
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
being sold or served in New Hampshire we
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
do not have a program for certification
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
or registration to ensure proper
 
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
identification making the sale of wild
 
03:30:23.710 --> 03:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
harvested mushrooms therefore not
 
03:30:26.110 --> 03:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
allowed now food establishments include
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
restaurants grocery stores suppliers
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
Farm stands farmers markets this bill
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
does not interfere at all with somebody
 
03:30:37.870 --> 03:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
wishes to H uh to harvest wild mushrooms
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
for their own personal use and likewise
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
I if they just share it with friendss
 
03:30:45.389 --> 03:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
that would not be harvested be
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited either with this now the
 
03:30:49.229 --> 03:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
difficulty with misidentified mushrooms
 
03:30:50.830 --> 03:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
can range from Simply a mushroom that's
 
03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
not edible to one that's toxic and the
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
toxic reactions can be things like minor
 
03:30:57.389 --> 03:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
gastrointestinal distress but it can
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
range up to kidney and liver failure and
 
03:31:01.790 --> 03:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
death so it's really important to assure
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the mushroom being sold is actually
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the mushroom being represented and is
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
safe to eat a restaurant which serves a
 
03:31:09.790 --> 03:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
dinner of inedible mushrooms or is the
 
03:31:11.229 --> 03:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
source of an outbreak of mushroom
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
poisoning would really sustain quite a
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
bit of damage to their reputation and an
 
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
outbreak of a mushroom poisoning would
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
give wild mushrooms a bad reputation
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
harming harming the competent foragers
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
so the foraging commission recommended
 
03:31:25.950 --> 03:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
that in order to meet the US Food Code
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire should
 
03:31:29.189 --> 03:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
Institute a program for certification
 
03:31:31.189 --> 03:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
and registration of individuals who
 
03:31:34.349 --> 03:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
either Harvest identify or distribute
 
03:31:36.670 --> 03:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms with the intent to sell
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
them to food establishments or to
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
private individuals as food the this
 
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced as hb1 1692 in 2020
 
03:31:45.870 --> 03:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
it passed through environment and
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture in the house then went to
 
03:31:51.429 --> 03:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
Edna passed out of Edna 15 to4 last year
 
03:31:53.229 --> 03:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
as an ought to pass with an amendment
 
03:31:54.750 --> 03:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
but then it died a covid death as the
 
03:31:57.630 --> 03:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
session ended now I had a lot of details
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the testimony that I
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
provided to you in advance including
 
03:32:04.910 --> 03:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
also the the bill the amendment which is
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
a very minor Amendment we'll talk about
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
in a moment and also the the report of
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the mushroom foraging committee Mission
 
03:32:12.510 --> 03:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into all those
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
details I put it there so you could just
 
03:32:15.870 --> 03:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
follow it but the bottom line is that
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
under this bill DHHS would be
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for approving an educational
 
03:32:22.030 --> 03:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
course for individuals who wish to
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
harvest identify and distribute wild
 
03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and that educational program
 
03:32:27.189 --> 03:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
will cover identification harvesting
 
03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
handling storage New Hampshire RS and
 
03:32:31.710 --> 03:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
the ethics of harvesting we have two
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
different certification levels tier one
 
03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
which is mushrooms that are easy to
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
identify there's no toxic GLC allyes and
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're not likely to cause in illness
 
03:32:41.950 --> 03:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
in humans the idea is that's for the
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
person who's more of a casual person who
 
03:32:45.790 --> 03:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
might only do a small amount then a tier
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
two list that includes a lot of other
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
mushrooms which can be more difficult to
 
03:32:53.229 --> 03:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
identify may have toxic gcco lies or may
 
03:32:56.110 --> 03:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
make a small percentage of humans ill
 
03:32:57.790 --> 03:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
when a food establishment or a private
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
purchaser purchase they have to purchase
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
from a certified Harvester or from a
 
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
distributor that is consistent with the
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
level of certification for that
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
mushroom now the registration program
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
would also be in the Department of
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and there'll
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
be an online database updated as new
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
individual certify a certification card
 
03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
given to each certified Harvester and
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
identifier and distributor as well
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
likewise public notification would be
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
given to the uh restaurant suppliers
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
grocery stores Farm stands farmers
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
markets so that they know that only
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
certified wild mushroom Harvesters Andor
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
Distributors would be allowed to sell
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
wild H harvested mushrooms as food the
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
point is the way that the wording goes
 
03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
in the food code is that any other
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
source would not be considered an
 
03:33:46.030 --> 03:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
approved source and therefore would not
 
03:33:48.990 --> 03:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to be used they would also be
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
informed as to what mushrooms are in the
 
03:33:52.150 --> 03:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
list by just having descriptions and
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
photographs if they wish to look at that
 
03:33:55.630 --> 03:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have the safety because
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
the certified uh um licensed forager
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
would know what they're doing but if
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
they want to check it they can take a
 
03:34:04.990 --> 03:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
look at that information too and then
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS would have the responsibility for
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
inspecting wild harvested mushrooms and
 
03:34:11.150 --> 03:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
Grocery Stores um they are already have
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
that capability and are the ones who
 
03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
would uh already be pulling the license
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
or cease and assist orders with people
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
who were selling them currently because
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
again it cannot be done currently and
 
03:34:22.830 --> 03:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
they'd have the authority to Levy fines
 
03:34:22.840 --> 03:34:23.670 align:start position:0%
they'd have the authority to Levy fines
for

03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
non-compliance um in order to be able to
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
track the mushrooms in case there is a
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
problem the Harvester or distributor uh
 
03:34:31.950 --> 03:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
generates a labeling tag that goes on
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
the mushrooms allows tracking now it's
 
03:34:35.189 --> 03:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
important to realize that most of the
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
work on this program has already been
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
done in the mushroom foraging commission
 
03:34:41.309 --> 03:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
we had two mycologists on the team we
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
had we went over the uh the tier one and
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
tier two lists and compiled those uh Dr
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
Rick vapo who's going to be testifying a
 
03:34:52.510 --> 03:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
little later on uh has already has a
 
03:34:54.429 --> 03:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
framework for a course that's completed
 
03:34:56.670 --> 03:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
there's a course at UNH uh some of the
 
03:34:58.550 --> 03:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
states just actually use courses by
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
their micology organizations in the
 
03:35:02.830 --> 03:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
state so the point is that the idea is
 
03:35:04.269 --> 03:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
that the state doesn't have to generate
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
a course they just approve it now with
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the amendment just last week
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
representative fellows who was one of
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
the co sponsors was contacted by a
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
person who questioned whether this bill
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
would apply to the harvesting of chaga
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
mushrooms now chaga mushrooms are not
 
03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
what we normally think of as a mushroom
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
because a mushroom is the fruiting body
 
03:35:25.630 --> 03:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
of a fungus the chaga is not the
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
fruiting body it is the Mycelia of the
 
03:35:30.269 --> 03:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
fungus that is harvested dried and
 
03:35:32.429 --> 03:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
ground to make tea purported to be
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
medicinal we don't normally think of
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
chaga is a an edible mushroom but to
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
clarify this uh we went ahead to put in
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would Define the uh a
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
mushroom as the fruiting body of a
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
fungus that would therefore exempt chaga
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
I would look forward to um the Dr Vandal
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
to comment whether he thinks we really
 
03:35:57.950 --> 03:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
need this amendment and likewise we do
 
03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
have uh lined up to testify um Eric
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
Milligan who owns the New Hampshire
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
mushroom company that grows mushrooms
 
03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
and he also uh is a collector of wild
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and would like to be able to
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
and also uh Colleen Smith from the food
 
03:36:17.469 --> 03:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
protection of DHHS is here to talk to us
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
today too um so that's basically the
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of it and I'm open for
 
03:36:28.110 --> 03:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
any representative Roy H thank you for
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is this Federal
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
Regulation how how long has this been an
 
03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
effect and um
 
03:36:43.870 --> 03:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
are there currently any wild harvested
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
mushrooms being sold right now in the
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
hampire in answer to the first question
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
it is the 2017 US Food Code although
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
that that is the date that is used I
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly when it was adopted
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh Cony Smith will be
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
able to answer that because that is her
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
field um as far as whether some of them
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
are sold now um I'm sure that some may
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
be sold but that that would be at this
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
point illegal uh it's not an approved
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
food source um and
 
03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
actually ER Eric Milligan who will be
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
discussing things later helped me a
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
little bit with this bill back when it
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
first came up uh way back before we
 
03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
developed the commission because he's
 
03:37:24.990 --> 03:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
had experience of people coming in
 
03:37:27.710 --> 03:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
trying to sell him mushrooms where three
 
03:37:28.950 --> 03:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
out of three were not what they were
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
claiming they were and so it certainly
 
03:37:33.630 --> 03:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
is something that does go on and is can
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
you okay
other

03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I haven't received
 
03:37:52.189 --> 03:37:52.199 align:start position:0%

345 that establishment establishes a
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
licensing program for mus mushroom
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
Harvesters um as representative kerk
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned the wild mushroom foraging
 
03:38:24.870 --> 03:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
study commission I previously served on
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
that commission work closely with
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative kerk and members of that
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
commission to um Forge a pathway forward
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
for the legal sale of wild mushrooms at
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
our licensed food establishments um as
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative kerk mentioned we have a
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
adopted the 2017 US Food and Drug
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
Administration food code into our
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that adoption
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
happened um in two thou 2019 in August
 
03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
2019 So within the food code it allows
 
03:38:59.309 --> 03:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh state to develop a the its own
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
program for the saf Harvest and and sale
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
to food
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
establishments uh we would be also happy
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
if asked to provide a fiscal note as
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
language within the legislation for the
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
Department to collect a a fee and to
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
administer fines for non-compliance with
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
u with the
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
regulation and I'd be happy to answer
 
03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have with
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh the Department's role
 
03:39:32.429 --> 03:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
in this Bill yes I have a question about
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the license fees
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
what what did you estimate to be the
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
approximate type of p and do you have an
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
idea of how many people will be
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
interested so uh the statute sets a
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
$75 would set a $75 registration fee
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
which would be for a fiveyear
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
registration at this time we we don't
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
have um a clear estimate of how many
 
03:40:06.030 --> 03:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
Harvesters we would have in um in the
 
03:40:08.349 --> 03:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
year I think we had thought potentially
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 um in our in our work with the
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
commission thank
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing none thank you
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%

03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
I am in support of this bill as I've
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
indicated uh online and have worked
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
closely with representative kerk and
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith representative fellows and
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
other members of the mushroom foraging
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
Commission in
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
2018 um we addressed quite a few
 
03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
different parameters relative to this
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
licensing uh requirement that we're
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
proposing and I believe we work through
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
most most of the uh
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
issues that seem to be at the table it
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
took quite a bit of time but I encourage
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
you to read the minutes of these
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
meetings if you have specific questions
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
and have concerns about various
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this process um I myself
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
am a myologist I have a graduate degree
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
in myology I've taught myology at The
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
Graduate and undergraduate level uh both
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%

and I currently serve as the president
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%

03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
Federation um I have been involved with
 
03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
mushroom collecting harvesting selling
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
trading uh since
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
1977 and uh I look forward to having
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
something on the books that replicates
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
what we have for other licensed
 
03:41:58.990 --> 03:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
professions I'm a certified Wetland
 
03:42:01.149 --> 03:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
scientist I served on the New Hampshire
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
joint board for 10 years as the
 
03:42:06.990 --> 03:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
chairperson I wrote the exam for wetland
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
science field the field portion uh and
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
assisted in the written test for wetland
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
scientists I also helped write the exam
 
03:42:18.349 --> 03:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
for the soil scientist so I'm familiar
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
with how to write certification exams
 
03:42:23.790 --> 03:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
that provide some shity for the public
 
03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
that a person is qualified to do the job
 
03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
they're tasked to do and uh I also on
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
the commission related a couple of other
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
stories uh relative to the problems we
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
currently face uh relative to selling
 
03:42:42.990 --> 03:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
Wild harvested mushrooms uh for sale in
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
unlicensed organizations and food food
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
clubs and I have several times come
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
across uh what I would consider toxic
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
mushrooms ones that weren't necessarily
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
fatally poisonous but ones that could
 
03:42:58.590 --> 03:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
certainly cause
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalization for sale on the shelves
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
at um farmers markets and actually in
 
03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
grocery stores um I've every time I
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
found that I've pulled these mushrooms
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
off the shelf and talk to the produce
 
03:43:14.830 --> 03:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
manager um it hasn't happened often and
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
I must uh state that over the past say
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
decade things have gotten better the
 
03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
Harvesters are more Savvy they're more
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
trained but there are still issues that
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with relative to the
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
possible ill effects of toxic mushrooms
 
03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
being sold in restaurants and to U other
 
03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
food Outlets so I encourage the
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee to consider this bill uh uh
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
seriously to to pass it and to also
 
03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
allow those of us that have been trained
 
03:43:49.469 --> 03:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
in this field to uh do our jobs in
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
providing both Public Safety and an
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
excellent food source for the public and
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank
 
03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:01.550 align:start position:0%

yes are there any other questions from
the

03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%

chair uh Rick it's good to see you
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
again and the question I have is uh many
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
people are quite aware of the fact that
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
mushrooms are delicious commercial
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
mushrooms uh and some mushrooms are
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
famous French are famous for their
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
Truffles and so forth um but people are
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
generally are quite often know that you
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to get the B the worst a bad
 
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
mushroom or a poisonous mushroom
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere near you how much would the
 
03:44:54.750 --> 03:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
would the uh Market expand if we had uh
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
rigorous collection and and distribution
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
Network that would enable people to be
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure that that that some exotic mushroom
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh that they had heard about was
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually the real thing and um and
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
they'd like to try it how much do you
 
03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
think the market would expand if we had
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of rigorous uh uh licensing or
 
03:45:24.149 --> 03:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
operation that this bill sets up in
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
place thanks very much for the question
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
Peter good to see you too um I have only
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotal reports of the increases and
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
sales for volumes of of wild harvested
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
mushrooms for states that have certified
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
Harvesters um Indiana is is a lead state
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island is another one North
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
Carolina we have several states that are
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
considering it or have accomplished it
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
but I unfortunately don't have any hard
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
data in terms of uh how that you know
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
affects the actual flow of mushrooms I
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
would state that since selling wild
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
Harvesters mushro harvested mushrooms at
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
this point in time in New Hampshire is
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
illegal that I can only imagine that
 
03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
with a certification process and the
 
03:46:13.309 --> 03:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
legality being taken care of that that
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
volume would increase um I would
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
encourage you perhaps to ask that same
 
03:46:19.870 --> 03:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
question to Eric Milligan who I believe
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
will be testifying as well since he owns
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire mushroom company
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
and yeah up in Tamworth exactly and he
 
03:46:32.910 --> 03:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
he um will U have certainly some numbers
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
relative to how much uh his sales of
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
wild harvested mushrooms may be affected
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the future by this bill terrific
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
looking forward to it I enjoyed him the
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
last time he was
 
03:46:48.269 --> 03:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
here I did want to just mention one
 
03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
other thing if you if I could add
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative Maguire that is um I
 
03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
believe representative kerk asked about
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh sentiments relative to chaga since
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
that's a highly valuable mushroom that's
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
been um sold now for many many years and
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
is um uh
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
certainly at at issue here because it is
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
not on the list and I have I believe
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
that that's probably a good thing uh
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
likely simply because it's U not a
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
mushroom itself it is in fact uh as
 
03:47:29.710 --> 03:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative kerk said in a melium but
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
more specifically it's a canker and it
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
being a canker part of the purported
 
03:47:39.990 --> 03:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
medicinal value of that canker lies in
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
the betulinic acid that comes from the
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
birch tree and since it is almost always
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
on a birch tree I would state that
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
harvesting it has a very different
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
ecological effect than harvesting a wild
 
03:47:56.149 --> 03:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
mushroom is most of you probably know
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
you pick a mushroom out of the ground
 
03:47:59.550 --> 03:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
it's like picking an apple off the tree
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
mushrooms are fruits they're meant to be
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
consumed and spread around that's why
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
they are attractive tasty fleshy and
 
03:48:09.670 --> 03:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
provide food value for wildlife but but
 
03:48:11.710 --> 03:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
caners are something different and they
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have food value per se
 
03:48:16.510 --> 03:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
but they have medicinal value and
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
therefore we believed at least many of
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
us on the commission that this was a
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
different organism that wasn't um you
 
03:48:26.830 --> 03:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
know appropriately included in the tier
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
one or tier two list so I thought I just
 
03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
i' mention those uh bits of fact and and
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
I again I'd be happy to answer further
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes thank
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows you cannot
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
ask questions you're co-sponsor of this
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm afraid you must remain
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
silent um I just want to clarify I
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
thought the rule was that if I testified
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
that I could not ask a question you are
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor that correct that is not
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
correct rule is that if you are a for
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the bill you cannot act as a member of
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
the committee for the purposes of the
 
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:10.110 align:start position:0%
the committee for the purposes of the
area

03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
migan was I muted that whole time yes
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
you were sorry I'll start again my
 
03:49:40.590 --> 03:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
name's is Eric Milligan I'm the primary
 
03:49:42.670 --> 03:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
owner of New Hampshire mushroom company
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
in Tamworth New Hampshire uh we were
 
03:49:46.750 --> 03:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
established in
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
2012 um I speak in support of HB
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
345 um it is one of the thing it's what
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
I do um to answer the question
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
specifically about the increase uh I
 
03:50:04.149 --> 03:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
represent many foragers and uh
 
03:50:05.309 --> 03:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
individuals that I've purchased
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
mushrooms from in the past I want to be
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
able to be allowed to legally
 
03:50:14.229 --> 03:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
forage market and sell wild mushrooms
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
um because that in what this program is
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
doing is is putting the into place an
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
approved Source uh myself being one of
 
03:50:26.149 --> 03:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
those once I go through all of it um you
 
03:50:28.030 --> 03:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
know the
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
process in regards to financial to
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question of coming in
 
03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
um I've gotten reports from a couple of
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
foragers where you want to talk about
 
03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
specifics you know almost a yearly wage
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
and for us here at the farm about uh you
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
know again depending on mother nature
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
income I yield the rest of my
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
time unless anyone's got any questions I

03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:13.149 align:start position:0%
 
did

03:52:13.149 --> 03:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
hello yes ah thank you I uh was just
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
having a uh computer anxiety moment
 
03:52:24.429 --> 03:52:24.439 align:start position:0%
there um yes thank you my name is Doug
 
03:52:28.510 --> 03:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
ginsky I own White Mountain forager and
 
03:52:30.630 --> 03:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm neutral on this bill I'm kind of in
 
03:52:32.670 --> 03:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
favor of the concept but I don't really
 
03:52:34.349 --> 03:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
want to put myself out there is
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
endorsing every concept of this bill I
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
think the best thing to do is to tell
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of how my business came
 
03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
to be um in 2013 I retired from a career
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
in fishing game as a conservation
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
officer and I served the last nine plus
 
03:52:54.910 --> 03:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
years as the district Chief in Coos
 
03:52:58.630 --> 03:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
County when I retired I had I'm blessed
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
to have a pension and I was looking for
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
something that would fill the Gap and
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
keep me
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
occupied at that time I was selling mush
 
03:53:10.269 --> 03:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
Chantell mushroom to the balsams
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant which had a Culinary Kitchen
 
03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
world class and I was selling several
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of mushrooms a year so
 
03:53:20.590 --> 03:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
when I retired I figured that would be a
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
great way to fill the Gap so I did my
 
03:53:26.830 --> 03:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
research being a law enforcement
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting my own cases things of that
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
nature I looked for applicable laws and
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
I found
 
03:53:35.710 --> 03:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
none in
 
03:53:40.269 --> 03:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
2013 and I interpreted that as the fact
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
that mushrooms were an unregulated
 
03:53:46.110 --> 03:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
industry because whether you acknowledge
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
it or not it is a very um active
 
03:53:53.469 --> 03:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire so unknowingly
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
I went ahead and filed an LLC White
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
Mountain forager um acknowledged wild
 
03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
mushrooms is my business I got product
 
03:54:06.269 --> 03:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
liability insurance and I went about my
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
business of um collecting and developing
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
markets for my mushrooms um I am was a
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
conservation officer I know landowner
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
ethics I comply with many of the
 
03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
provisions with regards to acquiring
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
landowner per permission from um people
 
03:54:29.309 --> 03:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
before I use their land and I go about
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
and I've been very successful and then I
 
03:54:33.550 --> 03:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
sold mushrooms to the littleon food
 
03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:34.710 align:start position:0%
sold mushrooms to the littleon food
co-op

03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
chantells and one of your HHS food
 
03:54:42.670 --> 03:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
inspectors lives in that area and we
 
03:54:44.790 --> 03:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
graciously acknowledge that I couldn't
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
do that and it needed to be addressed
 
03:54:48.990 --> 03:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
and needed to be fixed and I think
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today um my
 
03:54:54.710 --> 03:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
business has
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
been doing way better than I really wish
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
it would because I'm supposed to be
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
retired but what I guess what my point
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
is is that in seven years I now have a
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
half a dozen or so people that required
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
that I required w9s from for tax
 
03:55:16.149 --> 03:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
purposes at the end of the year I have a
 
03:55:19.950 --> 03:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
very active and growing business I find
 
03:55:24.670 --> 03:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
that Supply is not the issue um so much
 
03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
in that demand is so strong that I can
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
understand why there are food safety
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
requirements so I want this to be done
 
03:55:36.750 --> 03:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
but I at the same point don't want to
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
stifle uh what we have as um going again
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
I've been in business for close to eight
 
03:55:46.710 --> 03:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
years now um done quite a bit
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
of um business inside of New Hampshire
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
and outside and I have never had a claim
 
03:55:57.790 --> 03:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
on my um liability insurance so I don't
 
03:56:00.910 --> 03:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
I take offense to the term being used as
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's illegal because I believe at this
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
moment it's unregulated and I don't want
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
to get into uh into you know definitions
 
03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
of words however I went into this with
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
Noble intentions and I don't like being
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
tagged as a poacher because I'm doing
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
something that I did since I was knee
 
03:56:24.269 --> 03:56:24.279 align:start position:0%
high to my grandmother and I'll yield my
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much Mr brinsky are
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.229 --> 03:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
testify five representative fellows I
 
03:56:43.389 --> 03:56:43.399 align:start position:0%

the um mushroom commission and I just
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that um while the
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
commission um discussed which mushrooms
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
would go on tier one which are the ones
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
that are easiest to identify and um we
 
03:57:06.750 --> 03:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
did come up with a list that that was
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
just to kind of con ceptual activity and
 
03:57:15.149 --> 03:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
that the actual um responsibility for
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
developing that list will be under
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%

HB
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
219 um
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the repeal of the statute for
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
athlete agent RSA 332
 
03:58:52.319 --> 03:58:54.149 align:start position:0%
athlete agent RSA 332
J

03:58:54.149 --> 03:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
J
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
I uh looked at this uh statute
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
specifically BEC and and the and the
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
bills to follow specifically because
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
they um require no training
 
03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
and education
 
03:59:16.349 --> 03:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and in my
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
research um for this this statute it
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be that um in normal situations
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you have someone representing someone
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
else uh the person that
 
03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
they are representing is the person that
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
is actually held responsible for those
 
03:59:43.070 --> 03:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
actions um you know if you if you are a
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
normal business owner and you employ
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
someone and you get in a car accident
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
while you're on the job the
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility often goes to the if
 
03:59:59.469 --> 03:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
you're doing that action um like as a
 
04:00:01.870 --> 04:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative of that business or of
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
that person then you are the the actual
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
person that is um um that you are
 
04:00:11.550 --> 04:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
representing is held
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
responsible and uh the athlete agent
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
seems to be an unusual case and I
 
04:00:21.870 --> 04:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
believe it to
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
be um an unusual case because of
 
04:00:28.510 --> 04:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
Institutions like the
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
NCAA that
 
04:00:30.960 --> 04:00:33.229 align:start position:0%
NCAA that
um

04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
hold people
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
responsible or specifically colleges
 
04:00:43.790 --> 04:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for actions
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
that uh may be done by the by an
 
04:00:53.710 --> 04:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
agent while not technically under a
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
contract or anything with an agent with
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
a um a student such as buying them
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
dinner or giving them a gift etc etc if
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
the if
 
04:01:09.070 --> 04:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
the college student accepts the gift
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
they may be doing something which opens
 
04:01:13.870 --> 04:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
up colleges to
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
liability from the NCA um daa contract
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
that they have um the NCAA is private
 
04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
and not a government um agency and
 
04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that is a a contractual agreement
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
that those those colleges go into um
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
willingly and
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's I think that the um legislation is
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
actually trying to fix kind of uh an
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
issue that is uh created by some private
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
contracts and uh the NCA daa is is
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
changing their rules uh
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
regarding um who can and who cannot
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh essentially uh make money off of
 
04:02:09.990 --> 04:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
their likeness etc etc you may have
 
04:02:12.030 --> 04:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
heard of this um they were supposed to
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
come out with with uh some guidance um
 
04:02:20.670 --> 04:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
in January regarding this but it
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
has been kind of uh stalled a little bit
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
so we expect that this these new rules
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
will be coming out in the new near
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
future and
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh there and so I think that the the
 
04:02:37.720 --> 04:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
uh there and so I think that the the
committee

04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
um may want to uh hold off on deciding
 
04:02:47.710 --> 04:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:02:47.720 --> 04:02:49.309 align:start position:0%
this bill
until

04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
those actions come come out and so
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's why I sent uh an amendment to you
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
guys earlier today offering
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh to change the bill to a study
 
04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee to look into whether or not
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
first of all um whether or not athlete
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
agents are treated differently than
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
other representatives of
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
people um you know nowadays there
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
are options for people to be represented
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
um have contracts and become you know
 
04:03:30.510 --> 04:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
YouTube stars or whatever at younger and
 
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
younger ages you know twitch streamers
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
making contracts with uh
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
companies um to sponsor them or um and
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
also these options for NCAA may open up
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
the possibility for high school students
 
04:03:52.990 --> 04:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know um a wide range of people to be
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
represented in in a uh a lot of
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
different ways and so it's kind of
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
brings up the question on whether or not
 
04:04:04.510 --> 04:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
um athlete agents should have their own
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
designation or if it if really what the
 
04:04:12.910 --> 04:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
um the law is trying to do is to allow
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
some pass through some some um pass
 
04:04:21.070 --> 04:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
through from the um a third party that
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
has a contract or is essentially held
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the actions of a
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
person uh like the college have being
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
held responsible for the actions of a
 
04:04:36.670 --> 04:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
student or the student's
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
agent um
 
04:04:39.670 --> 04:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
whether that
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
be uh you know a brand manager or in
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
this case an athlete agent it's possible
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be completely
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
Rewritten and said you know allow for
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
that pass through or for
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
the um that we might decide that it's
 
04:05:03.309 --> 04:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for that pass through to
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
happen and that the per that those
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
people are acting um under the dis the
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
guidance of the athlete or and that
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
those the athlete should be held
 
04:05:18.510 --> 04:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
responsible and it's really a
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
contractual agreement between the
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
athlete and the school that needs to be
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
some there are some uh opportunities
 
04:05:38.590 --> 04:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
for waiting I I expect by um by the time
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the a study committee would would
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
form that the uh ncaaa will have drafted
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
in uh its new
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
rules and so it's possible that you
 
04:05:57.389 --> 04:05:57.399 align:start position:0%
would have more information about how
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
to uh address this or manipulate this uh
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
statute going
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
forward I'm happy I'm happy to answer
 
04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
any questions you have thanks we are not
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to form a study committee this
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
year so would you prefer that we voted
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
to kill this bill or that we and you
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
come in with a revised bill that
 
04:06:22.750 --> 04:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues you're concerned
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
with or do you want us to retain it to
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.189 --> 04:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
year I will say that the issues you're
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
bringing up of liability and
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
representation are not the normal issues
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
we deal with in DNA so we will probably
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
not be very
 
04:06:42.080 --> 04:06:43.630 align:start position:0%
not be very
helpful

04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:06:48.790 --> 04:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that it would be better to
 
04:06:52.590 --> 04:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
just so I so you want
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
to the options you're suggesting are
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:06.720 --> 04:07:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
itl

04:07:09.070 --> 04:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:07:09.080 --> 04:07:10.269 align:start position:0%
itl
I

04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
um I feel like that's up to the
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee I'm I'm willing to I'm willing
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
to work on the issue over the summer and
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
and come back to the committee okay with
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
with more information absolutely it's
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
not we will keep that in mind
 
04:07:27.520 --> 04:07:29.149 align:start position:0%
not we will keep that in mind
representative

04:07:29.149 --> 04:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
question um for exact okay fine there
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
yet other questions for representative
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
yet other questions for representative
Yuka

04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
Yuka
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
all right representative Horan you wish
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I yes I I'd love to speak to it
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
um I muted my so now I'm unmuted so my
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
name is Timothy Horan I represent
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
straford County District Six which is
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
the towns of uh Durham and Madbury and
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
Durham not in coincidentally is a
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
college town which has an extensive and
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
University of Hampshire has an extensive
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
of a division one Athletics program and
 
04:08:12.750 --> 04:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
I am a season ticket holder and a
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
supporter of those programs although I'm
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
just expressing my opinion so um I
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
haven't uh consulted with the uh you
 
04:08:21.189 --> 04:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
know the athletic department or the
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
other parties that are deal with it so I
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
think this
 
04:08:29.229 --> 04:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill um bills totally unnecessary um it
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
Ling is definitely the way to go with it
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
um when it gets to the floor I guess
 
04:08:35.790 --> 04:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
repent yella could try to Cable it in
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
which case then he'd be free to
 
04:08:39.109 --> 04:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
reintroduce it it next year but I I I
 
04:08:42.990 --> 04:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't see much value in that so the um
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
he's talk about private contracts and
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I agree I don't disagree with all
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
that in principle but the fact is that
 
04:08:54.750 --> 04:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh Sports both uh amateure Sports and
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
professional sports are very highly
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
regulated industry they're a uh um
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
mostly by so they have very uh very
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
elaborate rules for who's eligible and
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
who's not and so um one of the problems
 
04:09:11.070 --> 04:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
is if you sign a contract with an agent
 
04:09:12.269 --> 04:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
who then doesn't act your backed
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
interest you can lose your eligibility
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh and that happens that
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
happens to a student athletes all the
 
04:09:23.790 --> 04:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
time um so they they're they're very you
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
know there's very strict rules what a
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
student athlete can do and can't do and
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
you know maybe that's maybe that's not
 
04:09:31.790 --> 04:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
how it should be but that's the way it
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
is and um it's a positive experience I
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
know it's a positive experience for the
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the students at UNH and
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and the other schools that
 
04:09:43.229 --> 04:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
have programs so they consider very it's
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
a very positive it's considered very
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
positive by the vast majority of those
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
who participate in college athletics um
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
and also the other thing which I guess
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
Rend yella didn't bring up which I
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
thought he was going to is that uh you
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
might say well there aren't that many
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
professional athletes in New Hampshire
 
04:10:00.479 --> 04:10:01.630 align:start position:0%
professional athletes in New Hampshire
there's

04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
um there's probably more than more than
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
you think um we have a uh um because
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
there are uh you know there are usually
 
04:10:12.429 --> 04:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
un football team at Dartmouth
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
occasionally send a player to the pros
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
there's um nobody from UNH has ever
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
played professionally but there is a
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
player who grew up in Newcastle who's a
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
star in the NBA named Duncan Robinson so
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
this does affect some people and
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
also up also like before that um this
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
law also restricts this also um this Al
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
law also um deals with people who are uh
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
who are recruiters um often
 
04:10:39.790 --> 04:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
unauthorized by the colleges but there's
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
often boosters and others you get hold
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the families and um you know and you
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
know play on their you know play on
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
their hopes for their for their child's
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
future as a professional or college
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
athlete and so some of those um some of
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
those can act in ways which can end up
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know costing the families you
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
know a large amount of money wasting a
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
lot of their time and also some cases uh
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking away The Young Person's uh uh
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility of playing college and also
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't thing about professional sports is
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
um in most countries our system of
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
College athletics doesn't exist so
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
there's usually uh a network of amateur
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
and Semi-Pro professional clubs and so a
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
lot of those um I know especially in uh
 
04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
basketball which I'm the most personally
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with because um I've been
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
sitting in the stands for 15 years I've
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
gotten to know uh some of the people
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
affiliated with it especially a few
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
years ago it was a player whose father
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
was actually in the business of sports
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of these um so there are
 
04:11:40.030 --> 04:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
like a lot of uh there are a lot of
 
04:11:42.510 --> 04:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
Scouts who recruit players for uh you
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
know professional minor league
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
professional teams overseas especially
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
in basketball which has even though it's
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
invented here in the USA is just as
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
popular everywhere in the globe there's
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
probably thousands of professional teams
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
all of which have all of which like it
 
04:11:59.550 --> 04:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
possible to get a couple of uh us
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
players in there just to because you
 
04:12:01.680 --> 04:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
players in there just to because you
know

04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:12:05.229 --> 04:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
the players I think are better Coach
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
better coached in in many yeah so this
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
is yes anyway just the original Bill
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
anyway I'll get back to the original
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
bill passed um in 2006 it uh and um it
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed since and nobody's
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
asked to get rid of it till now it is
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
obviously a target for people just
 
04:12:24.990 --> 04:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
looking to you know eliminate quotequote
 
04:12:26.830 --> 04:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary regulation but I I don't
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
think this is I this regulations need
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's not onerous and also it's a
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
uniform bill so even in 2006 it was
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
existed in 40 other states and I think
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably more now I'm not aware of
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
any that have abolished it so this is a
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is a necessary bill it protects the
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
families and the student athletes and uh
 
04:12:47.550 --> 04:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
and the institutions so I I think we
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
should leave we should leave this uh RSA
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
330 TJ in place it's worked well since
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
2006 and it should stay in place um so
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's why I think you should
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
you should itl this bill if um I mean
 
04:13:03.630 --> 04:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for
 
04:13:03.640 --> 04:13:05.790 align:start position:0%

introducing

04:29:50.399 --> 04:29:52.149 align:start position:0%
208 right
regarding

uh the lightning rod dealer salesman
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
licensing and the repeal of that uh
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
lure statute um I looked up on
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire Department of
 
04:30:10.319 --> 04:30:12.030 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire Department of
Safety

04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
Administration uh website it doesn't
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
look like it's been updated
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
since maybe 2017
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
2018 um back then there were only four
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
dealers active in the state um once
 
04:30:31.080 --> 04:30:32.670 align:start position:0%
dealers active in the state um once
again

04:30:32.670 --> 04:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:30:37.590 --> 04:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's uh no
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh education or training requirements
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
obviously they would need
 
04:30:48.109 --> 04:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
to um you know anyone installing testing
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
modifying or repairing lightning
 
04:30:54.189 --> 04:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
products uh would need to
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
follow requirements
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:31:01.870 --> 04:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
NFPA um
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
780 standards and uh that's essentially
 
04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
all that one needs to do to to uh do
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
this job and so um I don't believe that
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
lure is required I believe
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
that um this could be repealed and if if
 
04:31:28.750 --> 04:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
the um committee believes that we we
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
could adopt you know uh something saying
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
that all persons have to follow this
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
um protection that's that seems fine but
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think it would be covered through the
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
process at local
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh at local uh planning and
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
zoning and so I don't believe this needs
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
to be a a state state license
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
so with that I will take any
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you did you read the
 
04:32:09.149 --> 04:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
letter from the Fire
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
Marshall I don't believe I received a
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
letter from the Fire Marshall oh well in
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
that case I'll paraphrase he says that
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's was created in
 
04:32:22.830 --> 04:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
1878 and the requirements for lightning
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
rods are included in the state fire code
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
and the state electrical code and this
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
is no longer needed he supports the
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
repeal okay well I agree with him then
 
04:32:37.950 --> 04:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.960 --> 04:32:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:32:47.429 --> 04:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%

um the license isn't needed um you know
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
this is all covered by existing state
 
04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
fire code electrical code and their
 
04:33:38.830 --> 04:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
existing standards so there's no need

record my name is representative Josh
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
Oella I
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
am representative for Fremont uh
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
introducing HB
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
218 uh relative to uh the repeal of this
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
for itinerant vendors to
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
be uh licensed in the state um
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
this is a statute that applies to PE to
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that come to our state and uh
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
to engage in a
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
temporary uh
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
business but they have an actual
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
business in uh other another
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
state and I believe that
 
04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
a lot this this uh requirement also
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
requires that they
 
04:44:44.360 --> 04:44:46.310 align:start position:0%
requires that they
have

04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:44:46.320 --> 04:44:48.868 align:start position:0%
have
uh

04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
bond with the state and I think that it
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
is not it is they they shall it says
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
that they shall make a special deposit
 
04:45:02.400 --> 04:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
that they shall make a special deposit
of

04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um in the F form of cash or
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
security bond with the secretary of
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
state and I think that this law is you
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
know uh a very old law and I think that
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
not um commensurate with the times of um
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh selling interstate is now happening
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
on the internet and I think it's
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
partially from uh rules like this that
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
limit people from from uh just coming in
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
for a short time you know the extra
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
hurdles of of putting this as an
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
impediment to to
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that the online option doesn't
 
04:46:00.270 --> 04:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't require you know whether it be
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh selling through through their website
 
04:46:03.280 --> 04:46:05.350 align:start position:0%
uh selling through through their website
or

04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
um other such means um you know putting
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
it through Amazon or whatever if they
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
want to sell their their products and so
 
04:46:17.788 --> 04:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
I think it actually is a detriment to
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
the state and I think we need to
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
consider uh a repeat of this the statute
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
when there are other options and it
 
04:46:28.830 --> 04:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be that we are um putting
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
people that want to actually come to the
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
state and uh do business here
 
04:46:37.708 --> 04:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
at uh disadvantage and encouraging them
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
to to make those sales online so I thank
 
04:46:45.628 --> 04:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
you and I'd uh welcome any
 
04:46:45.638 --> 04:46:47.150 align:start position:0%
you and I'd uh welcome any
questions

04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you reprid blus was
 
04:46:55.628 --> 04:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
first um okay is it my understanding
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
correct that this bill will leave in
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
place the existing RSA
 
04:47:04.350 --> 04:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
3112a which permits uh you know local
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
towns to regulate itinerant vendors so
 
04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
if they think they have a particular
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
locally yes it doesn't it does not
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
affect that okay thank you
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
chair so representative did you inquire
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State's office
 
04:47:27.390 --> 04:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
whether there's this bill is actually or
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
this statute is actually in in use you
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
cited modern technology and so forth I
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
think the the bill is intended to
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
protect the public from people who come
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
in and sell whatever that or service or
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
good product or whatever that maybe is
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
fraudulent and so forth so the the bond
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
is probably to protect the citizenry and
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
the towns not to facilitate the trade
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether you've checked
 
04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
with the SEC Secretary of State's office
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
since represent since David scanland is
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
here I'd like to find out if you haven't
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
talked with him what he has to say about
 
04:48:10.628 --> 04:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
age I think that that um so I just
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
looked on to the on the uh website
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
for I did not rec I did not uh talk to
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
them directly so I think he would be
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
best to answer that
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um having
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
served on Municipal and County
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
government many years ago we heard uh
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
about a similar bill and I believe that
 
04:48:48.510 --> 04:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
this statute covers
 
04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I say small rather independent say
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
magazine salesmen or people who sell
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
Goods going door Todo uh quite often the
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
towns that they are operating in are not
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
even aware of their presence uh if they
 
04:49:09.430 --> 04:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
do not go through the actual licensing
 
04:49:09.440 --> 04:49:10.430 align:start position:0%
do not go through the actual licensing
uh

04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
process and therefore unless they get a
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
complaint from one of their
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
citizens uh there's not going to be
 
04:49:20.350 --> 04:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
local consent
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
implied um unless there's a problem and
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
at that point I fear that it would be
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
too late uh unless there is some kind of
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing already put in place that they
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
could show a potential customer customer
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.040 --> 04:49:44.548 align:start position:0%
 
recourse

04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:48.190 --> 04:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
is representative Shu
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
that yes I I'm sorry I tried to say at
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
the end would you agree that that is the
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
type of person that's covered by
 
04:50:02.430 --> 04:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you so I think that um what
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're probably referring to is more
 
04:50:08.110 --> 04:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
covered by the um definition of Hawker
 
04:50:08.120 --> 04:50:08.868 align:start position:0%
covered by the um definition of Hawker
and

04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
peder um which is the bill that we're
 
04:50:15.070 --> 04:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing next but
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
um it depends where I guess the business
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
is located um if it's an out of-state
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
business that it would be an itinerant
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
vendor if it's like an instate business
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
then it would be a hawk or a
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
peder um but I think that uh in my
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
experience um people do people generally
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know with the first knock on the
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
door they are going on Facebook and
 
04:50:43.470 --> 04:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
asking who you know who this person is
 
04:50:46.510 --> 04:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone know them have have they
 
04:50:49.548 --> 04:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
bought um anything from them etc etc and
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
so at least in my experience the word
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
travels extremely fast and people know
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
exactly who it is and um there is a lot
 
04:51:01.548 --> 04:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
of commentary on whether or not you
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
should trust them or if you'd use their
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
service before and if they're reliable
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
etc etc um I definitely have experienced
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know within minutes of
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
people uh that do come door Todo but
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
none of them ever mentioned that they go
 
04:51:21.430 --> 04:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the state to find out that
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
information it's mostly um other people
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh discussing the service that is
 
04:51:27.520 --> 04:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh discussing the service that is
offered

04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
offered
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
um on and whether it's good or not they
 
04:51:33.788 --> 04:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
don't generally don't go to the state
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
information followup Madam chair
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um are you aware
 
04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative that a lot of older
 
04:51:45.400 --> 04:51:46.510 align:start position:0%
representative that a lot of older
senior

04:51:46.510 --> 04:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
senior
 
04:51:50.390 --> 04:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
citizens uh who how shall I say an
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous itinerant vendor might prey
 
04:51:56.670 --> 04:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
on uh do not have computers or do not
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
even think to go to Facebook or the
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
internet to look up um the identity of
 
04:52:08.548 --> 04:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.558 --> 04:52:10.350 align:start position:0%
 
door

04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
door
 
04:52:13.868 --> 04:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:52:13.878 --> 04:52:15.750 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
I

04:52:15.750 --> 04:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
do think that um I don't think that it's
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh specific
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
to um people of a certain age I believe
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that I was actually a victim
 
04:52:33.628 --> 04:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
of someone that uh came to my door
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
talked on it and was selling um you know
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
news uh supposedly selling um magazines
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
for that were going to be donated to
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
Veterans and um you know if I gave them
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
this check then uh some veterans would
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
be receiving uh
 
04:52:56.878 --> 04:52:58.990 align:start position:0%
be receiving uh
magazines

04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
magazines
 
04:53:03.150 --> 04:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
and um only later like after the person
 
04:53:03.160 --> 04:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
and um only later like after the person
left

04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I was suspicious the whole time
 
04:53:12.030 --> 04:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
but I I think that uh only later after I
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
left did I um do more research on them
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
and find out that I think that it was a
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
scam um because uh
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
but and uh I I don't know that there
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
was I didn't do anything about it I just
 
04:53:32.670 --> 04:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
I I decided whether or not I was going
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
to stop payment on the check and then
 
04:53:38.110 --> 04:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
that was the end of that uh situation um
 
04:53:38.120 --> 04:53:39.948 align:start position:0%
that was the end of that uh situation um
but

04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
um I I don't
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that the the risk is
 
04:53:50.270 --> 04:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
more from p a person knocking on the
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
door versus all of the scammers on the
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
internet trying to have you buy all
 
04:53:57.430 --> 04:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
04:54:01.990 --> 04:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I think actually being able to buy um
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I don't necessarily think
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
that that the risk is more in one place
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
versus another or one population versus
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
another I think um there are just
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
scammers out there and anyone can fall
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
prey so thank you for the
 
04:54:24.510 --> 04:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.390 --> 04:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you to the chair and thank
 
04:54:30.910 --> 04:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
you sir for taking my question uh is it
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
your interpretation of this bill would
 
04:54:35.948 --> 04:54:35.958 align:start position:0%
limit the governing board of any City
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
town or Village District to issue uh a
 
04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
vendor license Haus pedalist and all
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
that uh to Food Services
 
04:54:48.788 --> 04:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
providers and if that is the case they
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
have to get approval like in the example
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
in Nash through the Board of Health they
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
are open for inspection uh to make sure
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
that they are meeting the quality and
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
clean uh food standards that the uh the
 
04:55:04.110 --> 04:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
public would uh
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
would expect second too uh does this by
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
eliminating this bill eliminate the
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
chance for in the example a ntion or any
 
04:55:16.030 --> 04:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
other community on a farmer's market
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
limit uh gives them the chance to limit
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
the size of how bigger the farmer market
 
04:55:22.990 --> 04:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
that they want and just kind of opens up
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
the door to any type of vendor that may
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
want to come in and sell his particular
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
product without regulation thank
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:37.270 align:start position:0%
product without regulation thank
you

04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
sen Caleb yes I'm thank you for the
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
question um there seem to be a lot of
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
questions in that question but I don't
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
um I don't necessarily agree that this
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
will limit the powers of the
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
town this would be um whether or not
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
they had to go to the state first if
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
they if the
 
04:56:09.040 --> 04:56:11.310 align:start position:0%
they if the
local

04:56:11.310 --> 04:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
um municipality has regulations about
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
food vendors etc etc I think those would
 
04:56:16.958 --> 04:56:19.390 align:start position:0%
food vendors etc etc I think those would
still

04:56:19.390 --> 04:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
apply uh followup if I may follow uh
 
04:56:26.430 --> 04:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you well I'm having a hard time so
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for some clarity if you
 
04:56:31.470 --> 04:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
could please in my reading of this this
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation to to allow the
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
governing board of a city town a village
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
District in order to take that Authority
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this it would remove that
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
authority to the local
 
04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction excuse me representative
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
O'Brian yes mad chair RSA
 
04:56:56.350 --> 04:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
3112a already exists okay thank you
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the towns and cities have
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
that authority to license these vendors
 
04:57:06.510 --> 04:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
and simply as representative yila said
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
simply eliminates the requirement that
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
they go to the state first they the
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
authority to license them and they still
 
04:57:16.110 --> 04:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
have the same authority to require the
 
04:57:18.750 --> 04:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
same background checks or whatever it is
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
they they do do now and I thank the
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:37.948 align:start position:0%
 
fellows

04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
question when I looked at the um two
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
bills I they I got them confused in my
 
04:57:53.470 --> 04:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
mind but now that I look at the at the
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
um definition of itinerant vendors I see
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
it talks about somebody doing business
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
in a temporary place like a like a hotel
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
or a motel or vacant lot that that sort
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
of thing so so my question is how do you
 
04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
think this would impact um and it
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
requires State Licensing it's it's not
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
about um the local license how do you
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
think it would impact businesses like
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
like the um motorcycle week where lots
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
of people put up tents and and they have
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
um different businesses and and you
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
could also have some place that sets up
 
04:58:37.948 --> 04:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
a tent beside a motel and for most of
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
the summer sells some sort of goods but
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're not registered with the state
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
they you know you if if there's a
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
problem with the product you won't even
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
know who they were anymore so I
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
understand the other bill but this one
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.110 --> 04:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you for the question um
 
04:59:05.120 --> 04:59:06.750 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you for the question um
representative

04:59:06.750 --> 04:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
I don't have have those same concerns
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
the itiner vendor is is yes it could be
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
um could be could allow people from out
 
04:59:22.948 --> 04:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
of state to set up a a
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
temporary um situation where they are
 
04:59:29.948 --> 04:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
able to sell let's say like a um if a if
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
a business or or like your for example
 
04:59:36.430 --> 04:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
where you have like a bike week or
 
04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
something like that where businesses
 
04:59:42.750 --> 04:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
want to um you know rent out space or
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
something like that in their parking lot
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
and say okay these businesses can come
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
and you know for a short short amount of
 
04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
time say you know how great this new
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
bike is and they're an outof State
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
company and they just want to come in
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
for a short time to be able to display
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
their products on that um in front of
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
that business or motel or I mean
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
whichever business they want to you know
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would be at the
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
discretion of the owners of the property
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
of who they want to uh uh let on their
 
05:00:19.868 --> 05:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
property and also it would be part of
 
05:00:24.590 --> 05:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
the plan set out by the town and what um
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
is allowed in that specific area if if
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
other businesses are allowed you know if
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
if you have to get a a permit MIT um etc
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
etc so there would be still local
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding that and um I
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
think it's possible that the change
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
might be that there will be more
 
05:00:49.230 --> 05:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for outof State people to
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
events well thank you thank you repres
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
valro thank you for taking my question
 
05:01:01.868 --> 05:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
most but not all of the discussion and
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
concern seems to be centered around um
 
05:01:06.910 --> 05:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario the
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
scammers um but I wonder how um
 
05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
important that is in considering this
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
bill uh I so I I'll ask the question
 
05:01:18.270 --> 05:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
would we expect
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
scammers uh to apply for lure with the
 
05:01:23.788 --> 05:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
state so it still originates
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
complaint thank you for the question I I
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily believe that that all
 
05:01:37.230 --> 05:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
of the um I definitely don't think that
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
the scammers especially the one that
 
05:01:40.830 --> 05:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
came to my door was registered with the
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
state um it would have been pretty much
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
impossible to track him down because it
 
05:01:50.110 --> 05:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
was just some random person um but and
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is just a hurdle
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
definitely for uh law abiding people to
 
05:02:00.990 --> 05:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
um you know have to put up uh a bond and
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh fees and stuff like that and out
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
forms at the state level and then
 
05:02:07.628 --> 05:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
potentially at the local level as well
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
Shan thank you madam chair um more
 
05:02:17.788 --> 05:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
questions have entered my mind going to
 
05:02:20.670 --> 05:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
the question of local
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
control um first question if um as
 
05:02:29.310 --> 05:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien suggested some of
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
these folks and I I don't think we're
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
terribly concerned about large
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
corporations who uh bring their business
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
say to bike week I think they're
 
05:02:41.708 --> 05:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
responsible but we're talking about the
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
smaller scale uh people who sell food
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
from a tent uh people who sell leather
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
goods just from a a tent that kind of
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
thing um and would it not be requiring
 
05:03:00.910 --> 05:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
each town that they go to um report have
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
their business in
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
uh temporarily wouldn't it require that
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
town to have someone knowledgeable about
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
each of those different fields which
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.350 --> 05:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
question um so I think that there
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
are all types of businesses that may
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
come into a town and the
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
regulations for those are
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
relatively generic as to not
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise one versus another and I
 
05:03:42.670 --> 05:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
think that there may be
 
05:03:42.680 --> 05:03:44.190 align:start position:0%
think that there may be
concerns

05:03:44.190 --> 05:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are normal in the in the process
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
of allowing a use of some property but I
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
definitely don't think that we want to
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise the small
 
05:04:00.310 --> 05:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
businesses um
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
and and by by having this because it's
 
05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
definitely going to be much harder for
 
05:04:11.788 --> 05:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
small businesses to make dep deposits or
 
05:04:15.430 --> 05:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
security bonds um available to the to
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the state whereas obviously large
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
corporations would have no issue doing
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
that so I think that this is definitely
 
05:04:25.948 --> 05:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
um has has more effect on the small
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
business uh aspect and definitely ones
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
that have um or are benefited by
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
physical presences instead of uh remote
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
presences like being
 
05:04:42.910 --> 05:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
online further
 
05:04:42.920 --> 05:04:44.708 align:start position:0%
online further
question

05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um my my other
 
05:04:51.990 --> 05:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
thought is that most of these uh folks
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
who come and do business like this in
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
small towns tend to go through several
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
towns within a few days that would
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
require them to go to each individual
 
05:05:07.830 --> 05:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
town to get a license rather than
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
getting one ticket so to speak from the
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
state uh you don't see that as an
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
additional hardship on the uh small
 
05:05:19.548 --> 05:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
businesses that you're claiming this is
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
benefiting actually representative Shu
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're required to
 
05:05:26.350 --> 05:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
to right now they are required to go to
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
every town that requires such a license
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
if that they do business in that's
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
current law this bill would not affect
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:43.270 --> 05:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I just want
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
to follow up uh I guess in the line of
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
Representative shu's questions because
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
as I look at the
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
definition um and it was stated earlier
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
principal place of businesses not in the
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
state who engaged in temporary or
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
transient business in the state either
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
in one locality or traveling from place
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
to place selling good wears
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
merchandise and then it goes on to uh
 
05:06:15.030 --> 05:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
State also uh temporary place of
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
business means any public or quasi
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
public place including but not limited
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
to a hotel motel rooming house store
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
room building part of a building tent
 
05:06:28.510 --> 05:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
vacant lot railroad car or
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
trailer um that's pretty mobile
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
and as it you further go out the state
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative yella uh I just and I'm
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
getting to my
 
05:06:39.280 --> 05:06:40.830 align:start position:0%
getting to my
question

05:06:40.830 --> 05:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:06:45.548 --> 05:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
Association provisions of this chapter
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
by reason of associating himself
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
temporar temporarily with any local
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
dealer Trader or Merchant or by
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
conducting such temporary transient
 
05:06:56.750 --> 05:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
business in connection with or as part
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the business or in the name of any
 
05:07:02.110 --> 05:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
local dealer Trader or Merchant that the
 
05:07:02.120 --> 05:07:03.628 align:start position:0%
local dealer Trader or Merchant that the
uh

05:07:03.628 --> 05:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
vendor may this he may not associate
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
with I'm sorry on that one so my
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
question goes to you uh following up on
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative shuart don't you believe
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
it would be better for the state to keep
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
track of these vendors coming in and out
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
of the state having them on record so
 
05:07:23.070 --> 05:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
cities and towns can look it up and make
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure they are a uh pertinent dealer and
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh have been vest vetted because if
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're Transit they're going to be
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
busing from town to town to town to town
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
and uh it's going to be up to localities
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
to review this individual uh upon
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
applying for the license versus being
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
able to just go to One location the
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
state for that vendor do you believe uh
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
it would be easier uh to keep this law
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
reason thank you for the question I
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think it would be
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
easier to keep the law in place I mean
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's definitely easy to keep the law in
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
place we wouldn't have to do anything
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
but I think that um there so this what
 
05:08:13.708 --> 05:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
you were just reading was um it says um
 
05:08:15.390 --> 05:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
the local Association it says no
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendor shall be exempt from
 
05:08:17.440 --> 05:08:18.670 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendor shall be exempt from
these

05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions just by reason of associating
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
themselves with any local dealer so if a
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
car dealership wants to host the company
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
that manufactures the the cars that they
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
produce and says hey these this is the
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer they have this special um
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
deal going on with these cars or this
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that we don't normally have
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
at our dealership you know they are
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
selling their their wees here they would
 
05:08:52.948 --> 05:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
need to go to the
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
state and file that uh information with
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
the state and the question of whether or
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
not the
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
local uh the the local municipality
 
05:09:13.390 --> 05:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
wants to also
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
control that information uh or that
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
license is up to the local town if they
 
05:09:23.070 --> 05:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
want to do that or not I don't think
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
that it's necessarily um helps them uh
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
to have an additional layer of
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:34.548 align:start position:0%
to have an additional layer of
Regulation

05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
chair so in reading the definition and
 
05:09:44.830 --> 05:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
being a transient
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
group don't you would you agree that it
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
would be harder to keep track of these
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
individuals as they moved from town to
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
town if they were doing bad business in
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
the town and were kicked out or license
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
revoked um and moved on to the next town
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
by the time the next town was able to
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
research them before they gave out a
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
license versus just going to the state's
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
database um that it be easier for these
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
radar thank you for the for the followup
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
the that
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
it that the damages any damages or
 
05:10:32.910 --> 05:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
um can still be um
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
addressed by the company that where it
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
com is uh permanently based so this
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
would just be essentially like you know
 
05:10:43.200 --> 05:10:44.070 align:start position:0%
would just be essentially like you know
a

05:10:44.070 --> 05:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:10:48.788 --> 05:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
popup uh let's say a popup McDonald's or
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
something like that for you know a few
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
days in this specific spot and or you
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
know it's May maybe McDonald's is not a
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
good example because they're in all 50
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
states but a a a business a restaurant
 
05:11:06.510 --> 05:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't normally is not normally in
 
05:11:08.910 --> 05:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire comes to New Hampshire for
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
a popup restaurant gets their you know
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
food license stuff like that and then
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
um doesn't perform in in a way that that
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
is uh commensurate with that license I
 
05:11:25.110 --> 05:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
do think that you know if there was
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
anyone harmed or anything like that I
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
think there still would be the the
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
company at its base location that could
 
05:11:34.230 --> 05:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
be gone after after by the the people
 
05:11:36.548 --> 05:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
that were affected I don't necessarily
 
05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
think that the the fact that they
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
traveled necessarily would make it um
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
impossible for for that to be followed
 
05:11:46.760 --> 05:11:48.430 align:start position:0%
impossible for for that to be followed
up

05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.670 --> 05:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
BR thank you madam chair representative
 
05:12:02.590 --> 05:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
yaka yella sorry if um
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
the let's say that this bill
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
passes and then it it up to the
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
um municipality
 
05:12:20.270 --> 05:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
to monitor this and something
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
happens whose responsibility is it
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
within the municipality to notify other
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities let's say it's summer and
 
05:12:31.628 --> 05:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
you know in our town on the coast
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
there's many
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
people so somebody starts in Hampton and
 
05:12:38.030 --> 05:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
makes their way up to Portsmouth whose
 
05:12:40.590 --> 05:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility is it in the
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
town to notify other towns and what's
 
05:12:52.350 --> 05:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
05:12:55.320 --> 05:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
um

05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
my response is that I don't believe that
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
it is required that a town notify other
 
05:13:09.310 --> 05:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
towns or States just like it's you know
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
not required that New Hampshire
 
05:13:12.160 --> 05:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
not required that New Hampshire
notify

05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
notify
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
Florida if someone has an
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
issue uh in New Hampshire it would be
 
05:13:24.190 --> 05:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
exactly the same situation you
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be required to notify other
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities States uh you would
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh the person that would be harmed could
 
05:13:36.240 --> 05:13:37.948 align:start position:0%
uh the person that would be harmed could
go

05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
to directly to that that company however
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
the municipality doesn't have
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily will have even jurisdiction
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
over over the actual fine depending on
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh they have jurisdiction with with the
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
company as a
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:02.868 align:start position:0%
company as a
whole

05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
whole
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.240 --> 05:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
chair

05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
follow so that's what you think and what
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
basis is that thought what's the basis
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
of that thought that no one's
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.788 --> 05:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
damaged relevant
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
question he says he doesn't know and
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:40.510 --> 05:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
scanland thank you madam chair and
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm David
 
05:14:45.150 --> 05:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state and I
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide the committee
 
05:14:47.708 --> 05:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
with some
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
information uh the Secretary of State's
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
office is charged with the
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
administration of the statutes related
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
to itinerate vendors uh and Hawkers and
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
pedlers and what I can tell you uh with
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
that statute is that in terms of
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
itinerate vendors we probably receive uh
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh about 100 applications a year and
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
issu permits to those uh uh applicants
 
05:15:17.030 --> 05:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh the number of Hawkers and pedlers
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we deal with are probably triple
 
05:15:22.548 --> 05:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
that amount in the course of a year we
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
probably collect $220,000 in fees uh
 
05:15:29.070 --> 05:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
that are paid by both itinerant vendors
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
and Hawkers and
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
peders and once the permit is issued
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is usually the last time we see
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
that individual until it's time to renew
 
05:15:42.190 --> 05:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
the permit we received very few
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
complaints at the state level related to
 
05:15:44.760 --> 05:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
complaints at the state level related to
these

05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
individuals I can't recall ever having
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
to tap into the $5,000 shity bond that
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know that they uh put out there
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
when they apply and
 
05:16:02.110 --> 05:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
um uh you know from from our perspective
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's pretty smooth sailing
 
05:16:07.548 --> 05:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
with them now municipalities as as was
 
05:16:10.590 --> 05:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh can issue their own permits
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I think most of the larger
 
05:16:15.310 --> 05:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
communities do do that uh they may have
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
more uh interaction with these
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and it's possible that uh
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know they may do some some
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh at that level that that
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
we just don't
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
see the secretary of state is authorized
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
to revoke a license uh after a hearing
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um I can't recall that uh ever having
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
taken place uh in recent memory either
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
um So based on that I mean we we don't
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
have strong feelings on this piece of
 
05:16:51.150 --> 05:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
legislation one way or the other um if
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
it makes our you know our State
 
05:16:55.750 --> 05:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
Community feel better because these
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
individuals have to register uh we're
 
05:17:01.230 --> 05:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to continue to do that
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh but our experience has been that
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
there are very few issues with these
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
individuals at least at the state level
 
05:17:13.150 --> 05:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Roy thank you
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr um can you
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
tell us what is involved in the process
 
05:17:23.230 --> 05:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
of Licensing these folks do you do like
 
05:17:25.788 --> 05:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
a criminal background check on them or
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
what what is involved in that it's a
 
05:17:31.230 --> 05:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
very simple process the applicant comes
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
in in they fill out an
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
application uh one of the one of the
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions asked about any type of a
 
05:17:43.868 --> 05:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
criminal record um and they answer the
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
question but there is no background
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
check beyond that uh even if they say
 
05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
they have a a criminal record uh the
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
permit is still issued to them the fee
 
05:17:53.920 --> 05:17:54.548 align:start position:0%
permit is still issued to them the fee
is

05:17:54.548 --> 05:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
$50 follow up followup so just for
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
clarification the sole role of of the
 
05:18:05.948 --> 05:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
office is to collect the fee and the
 
05:18:08.830 --> 05:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
bond to ensure the bond and issue the
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
permit so there's there's really no um
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily benefit to the communities
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
other than knowing that that bond has
 
05:18:19.548 --> 05:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
been isue is that a fair
 
05:18:21.788 --> 05:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
statement that's fair I mean our our
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
role is
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
ministerial uh we keep a record of all
 
05:18:28.110 --> 05:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
of those that receive a permit and as I
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is a provision that
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
allows the Secretary of State to revoke
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
a permit uh after a hearing but uh I
 
05:18:38.230 --> 05:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
can't ever recall that being that part
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:45.868 --> 05:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
you other
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um my
 
05:18:54.670 --> 05:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
question um is just if the if Mr
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
scanland recalls any cases of people
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted because they were
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
license I can't recall that happening
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
either um I I would uh like to check
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
with the staff in our office just to see
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
if they're aware of anything like that
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to do that and get
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%

05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
that you issue uh as the sponsor
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
suggests are issued through companies
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
that are doing business out of the state
 
05:19:48.030 --> 05:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
and are just here temporarily or are
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%

individual represent Shu I don't have a
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
an answer to that question off the top
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
of my head without researching that a
 
05:20:01.350 --> 05:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
little bit and I'll be happy to do that
 
05:20:01.360 --> 05:20:03.830 align:start position:0%

welcome and thank you for taking the
 
05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
question isn't this somewhat of a
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
deterrent to Bad actors looking to come
 
05:20:22.150 --> 05:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
into the state um and it also gives some
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
accountability for cities and towns to
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
look back and see that they've uh put
 
05:20:28.990 --> 05:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
the bond up and
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh have filled out the proper pap
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork as to their um legal
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
background whether they've been in
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
trouble or not and $50 is a small price
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
to pay to have
 
05:20:41.380 --> 05:20:41.390 align:start position:0%
that um information
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:42.548 align:start position:0%
that um information
[Music]

05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
available it it may be represent goalie
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
um it's it's one of those things where
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
from our perspective we just don't see a
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
history of um abuse of the permit but
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that just the fact
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
that we issue them isn't a deterrent to
 
05:21:00.878 --> 05:21:02.510 align:start position:0%
that we issue them isn't a deterrent to
uh

05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
misbehavior and if it gives Comfort to
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
the uh citizens of the State of New
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then you know that may be
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
justification to maintain the law as it
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr

scandin thank you don't go away because
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have similar ones on the
 
05:21:26.360 --> 05:21:27.390 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have similar ones on the
next

05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
F does anyone else wish to testify on
 
05:21:33.868 --> 05:21:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:37.390 --> 05:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
218 all right seeing none I will close
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing open the hearing on House
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
yila thank you madam chairman and uh
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is Josh uh representative
 
05:21:54.320 --> 05:21:55.310 align:start position:0%
record my name is Josh uh representative
Josh

05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
Josh
 
05:21:57.548 --> 05:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
yella uh from
 
05:22:02.750 --> 05:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
Fremont introducing uh HB
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
2117 uh repealing RSA 320 regarding
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hawkers and
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
pedlers uh much
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
of uh my comments on this would be
 
05:22:20.190 --> 05:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as the the previous
 
05:22:20.200 --> 05:22:22.430 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as the the previous
Bill

05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh other than uh the fact that that
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
these are more likely to be
 
05:22:34.670 --> 05:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
um people
 
05:22:36.750 --> 05:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
that instead of
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
being uh serviced by potentially uh
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
Amazon or whatever uh would be much more
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
likely to be serviced by you know
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
Craigslist or or still eBay but also
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're comp we're competing with that and
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that it still allows for
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
these to be
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh regulated at the local level and so I
 
05:23:08.310 --> 05:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
additional requirement for the state
 
05:23:11.400 --> 05:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
additional requirement for the state
level

05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh license is not necessary and I would
 
05:23:20.430 --> 05:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
consider consider that uh or I would
 
05:23:23.548 --> 05:23:23.558 align:start position:0%
like the committee to consider uh
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
repealing this and supporting HB 217
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh I'll take any questions
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question I looked at
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
2117 and
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
218 and it appears that if we passed
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
both of them the effect would depend on
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
which one was last because they do not
 
05:23:45.628 --> 05:23:45.638 align:start position:0%
appear to be
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.150 --> 05:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you for the question
 
05:23:53.160 --> 05:23:54.948 align:start position:0%
please thank you for the question
um

05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:54.958 --> 05:23:56.510 align:start position:0%
um
that

05:23:56.510 --> 05:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
is not my
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
intent and
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
uh I am not aware of that issue but I'm
 
05:24:09.788 --> 05:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
happy to look into it and get back to
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
you well if you just look at the bottom
 
05:24:15.390 --> 05:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
line uh line
 
05:24:19.230 --> 05:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
14 House Bill 217 repeals deletes the
 
05:24:21.548 --> 05:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
comment about RSA
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
320 and leaves
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
321 28 deletes 321 and leaves
 
05:24:28.160 --> 05:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
321 28 deletes 321 and leaves
320

05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
320
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
320
so

05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated right does anyone else have
 
05:24:54.600 --> 05:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
coordinated right does anyone else have
a

05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
none no one else has spoke has signed up
 
05:25:14.320 --> 05:25:15.788 align:start position:0%
none no one else has spoke has signed up
to

05:25:15.788 --> 05:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:18.430 --> 05:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
speak does anyone wish to testify on
 
05:25:29.310 --> 05:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
217 okay then
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.788 --> 05:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
hearing and we we will resume the public
 
05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.638 --> 05:25:52.948 align:start position:0%
 
build

05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
377 377
 
05:26:00.270 --> 05:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
377 A Fire Marshall and um Recovery
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
you so ah yes Miss
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.600 --> 05:26:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
Vach

05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.788 --> 05:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
I raised my hand because I thought we
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you do you have a
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions is this on House Bill this is
 
05:26:53.070 --> 05:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
on the on the U recovery houses
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
correct black has a question I'm uh it
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
might have been the lady was just
 
05:27:03.510 --> 05:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
speaking um um it was stated that uh the
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
fire State Fire Marshal Fire Marshals
 
05:27:07.548 --> 05:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
can already Grant
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions for Recovery houses so this
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill isn't needed my question is are
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
they actually being granted are there
 
05:27:17.230 --> 05:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
places trying to get exceptions where
 
05:27:22.750 --> 05:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.350 --> 05:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
um my understanding from um fire marshal
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
perzi was that he granted an exception
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
just a week or so ago but I see that
 
05:27:33.510 --> 05:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
he's come on so maybe he's better to
 
05:27:38.190 --> 05:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
represented mam chair I'm sorry did was
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
the question are we um granting
 
05:27:52.350 --> 05:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
variances now is that what the question
 
05:27:52.360 --> 05:27:53.868 align:start position:0%
variances now is that what the question
was

05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:27:56.310 --> 05:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question uh the
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
answer is yes we have
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:01.230 align:start position:0%
answer is yes we have
granted

05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
granted
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh two or three
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
variances recently we've also
 
05:28:10.990 --> 05:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
denied uh several but the denials to the
 
05:28:13.548 --> 05:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
best of my recollection the denials
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
were at least a couple of years
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
ago thank you followup so given that you
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
can do that um you know what benefit do
 
05:28:26.590 --> 05:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
you see if this law were
 
05:28:28.670 --> 05:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
pass thank you for the question I think
 
05:28:31.868 --> 05:28:31.878 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's something
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
that it's a fundamental uh policy
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
question that I think um Kim is
 
05:28:40.830 --> 05:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely right Miss Bach is absolutely
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
right currently um we can issue a
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
variance to the state fire code under um
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
under the statute under under 153 and
 
05:28:53.548 --> 05:28:53.558 align:start position:0%
under uh safe C
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
6000 however I I guess I look at this
 
05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
more of a kind of a blanket policy
 
05:29:01.230 --> 05:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
decision kind of like when the
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
legislature decided that we didn't want
 
05:29:05.948 --> 05:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
to have uh sprinkle systems in one and
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
two family dwellings so rather than the
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshals office take on the
 
05:29:17.230 --> 05:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
full um responsibility of deciding
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're in a in a kind of
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
a global way whether uh recovery
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
residences ought to be exempt from
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
sprinklers um if they are if they were
 
05:29:32.590 --> 05:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
to follow some other certain rules um we

recovery houses that do not that are not
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry we
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
can't we we certify and our our
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
delegated to ser certify voluntarily
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
certify recovery houses across the state
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
of New
 
05:31:08.350 --> 05:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's up to the recovery house
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
to come to us to request
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
certification and um we have certified
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
so far 48 houses and we're working on
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
another seven or eight right now we know
 
05:31:22.628 --> 05:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
of another about 30 that we're ready to
 
05:31:24.990 --> 05:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
make contact with to see if they're
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
interested um but no there's no reason
 
05:31:30.150 --> 05:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
for a recovery residents to become s
 
05:31:32.910 --> 05:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
certified or to go on the state
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:42.110 --> 05:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
required and followup
 
05:31:45.948 --> 05:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
please um you mentioned that maybe a
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
Miss did you but you mentioned
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
that you were under tighter regulations
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
than other groups is that correct and
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
why if these exemptions
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
exist if I understand the question
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
correctly um if House Bill
 
05:32:05.440 --> 05:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
correctly um if House Bill
377

05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
377
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
passes New Hampshire cert core certified
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
houses or houses on the New Hampshire
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
state Registry of recovery
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
houses would be under stricter
 
05:32:22.990 --> 05:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
regulations than those that receive an
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
exemption um they would be required to
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
have a walkth through from the um an
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
inspection from the fire department on
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
at least an annual basis um and there
 
05:32:37.868 --> 05:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
were other pieces of that
 
05:32:42.390 --> 05:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill that wouldn't be applied to
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
other congregate living situations in
 
05:32:47.590 --> 05:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:32:49.470 --> 05:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods who were granted an
 
05:32:51.868 --> 05:32:51.878 align:start position:0%
exemption there's a that laundry list of
 
05:32:54.830 --> 05:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
items is all additional
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
things this is my last question I
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
promise thank you why can't
 
05:33:12.110 --> 05:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I believe the short answer is they
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
can but they haven't yet okay thank
 
05:33:26.070 --> 05:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
question yes I do Madam
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
chair so uh Miss uh Bach my question
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
goes to a statement you made earlier
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
before we recessed the hearing um it
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
seems to me like you're doing extremely
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
meticulous and solid laudable work I
 
05:33:46.628 --> 05:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
don't have any issue with the issue
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're raising the question I have is
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
the the reports that that I've been
 
05:33:53.708 --> 05:33:53.718 align:start position:0%
hearing that there are outfits out there
 
05:33:58.270 --> 05:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
that that are not Kosher not legit
 
05:34:01.868 --> 05:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
whatever uh that are pretending to be
 
05:34:04.270 --> 05:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
recovery houses but are not or at least
 
05:34:07.230 --> 05:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
are very shotly run or
 
05:34:09.708 --> 05:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
whatever and and the fire marshal is not
 
05:34:11.110 --> 05:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to approve those people they're
 
05:34:12.990 --> 05:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to shut them down or make them
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
clean up their act and so forth and so
 
05:34:18.190 --> 05:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
on so can you speak to that contingent
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
people who are probably not contacting
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have anything to do
 
05:34:23.070 --> 05:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
with you because they're kind of running
 
05:34:25.548 --> 05:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
a scam based on what I'm hearing can you
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
talk to that for that question so there
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
are there are definitely houses out
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
there that are running questionable
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
operations um and we know across the
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
country that we have to be concerned
 
05:34:40.628 --> 05:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
about human trafficking we have to be
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about drug dealing we know
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
that in any industry there will be
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
people who will take advantage of a
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
situation if they can do that and this
 
05:34:51.548 --> 05:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
is every housing is a place where they
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
can take advantage however there are
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
also very reputable houses out there
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
that have their own um
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
their own source of financing they have
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
their own means to get recovery
 
05:35:08.750 --> 05:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
residents within their recovery house
 
05:35:10.510 --> 05:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
and they have no need for the
 
05:35:13.230 --> 05:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
connections that NH core can provide or
 
05:35:15.868 --> 05:35:15.878 align:start position:0%
that the state registry system can
 
05:35:19.628 --> 05:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
provide um they have out ofate funding
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
sources they may have out ofate
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
clientele sources there's no reason at
 
05:35:25.868 --> 05:35:25.878 align:start position:0%
all for them to come forward and get
 
05:35:28.910 --> 05:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
certified and they may run excellent
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
houses as well
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
they should be treated the
 
05:35:35.230 --> 05:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
same they we all should be treated the
 
05:35:37.548 --> 05:35:37.558 align:start position:0%
same and we should be treated the same
 
05:35:40.948 --> 05:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
as any other similar type of housing so
 
05:35:43.230 --> 05:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
another type of housing would be some of
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
those um houses that are turned into
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
apartments for un andh
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:55.830 --> 05:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
same okay it just seems to me like the
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
fire marshall is going to be what I'm
 
05:35:59.910 --> 05:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the Fire Marshall
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
going after the places that are unsafe
 
05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
and unscrupulous and so forth I don't
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
think he's coming after you guys I don't
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
see it as a situation where they're
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to be discriminating but but
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
you're the expert so I'll defer to you
 
05:36:14.638 --> 05:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
you're the expert so I'll defer to you
representative

05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair who who
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%

05:36:35.470 --> 05:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
requirements are established by the
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
National Alliance of recovery
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%

recognized by the by Congress it's often
 
05:36:47.948 --> 05:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
cited in federal reg regulations as
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%

House those regulations are how we
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
certify again it's a voluntary
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
certification so they do not apply to
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
Oxford Oxford houses and there aren't
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
Oxford houses in
 
05:37:07.310 --> 05:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester they don't apply to anyone
 
05:37:08.590 --> 05:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't come forward to be
 
05:37:08.600 --> 05:37:10.948 align:start position:0%
that doesn't come forward to be
voluntarily

05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%

legislation that um would affect
recovery

05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:47.070 --> 05:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
no okay representative laus um thank you
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so you said it's
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in that there's other
 
05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
types of housing that are similar like
 
05:37:58.150 --> 05:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh the apartments that are you know for
 
05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
students and my question
 
05:38:04.910 --> 05:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
is um you give me an example of a place
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
that a type of
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
housing that would not need um some kind
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
of exception from the fire
 
05:38:17.470 --> 05:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
marshal to operate you know maybe I can
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
word this better so you're looking for
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of exceptions for the
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
recovery houses I one I know of as
 
05:38:24.670 --> 05:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
sprinklers there may be others but is
 
05:38:26.430 --> 05:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
there some other kind of
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
housing that um you know would want to
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
operate or would operate without
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
sprinklers or those other
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
requirements that wouldn't end up with
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
the same kind of
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh requirements that are in this bill
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for you know is there really
 
05:38:47.468 --> 05:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
a case clearly of
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination could I defer that
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
question to Chris Wellington as she is
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:59.150 --> 05:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
law do you what I'm looking for is an
 
05:39:02.788 --> 05:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
example Le not an exposition on the law
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:05.638 --> 05:39:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
better

05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:39:13.468 --> 05:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
Chris this is Christine Wellington um
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm a board member of New Hampshire
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
Corp um we could use representative
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
O'Brien's example of the um duplex home
 
05:39:29.390 --> 05:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
and according to uh repres
 
05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien um because
 
05:39:34.390 --> 05:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're single family homes but
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
because they're duplexes there the fire
 
05:39:38.990 --> 05:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
code requires smoke detectors if that
 
05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
duplex was a recovery home um our
 
05:39:45.390 --> 05:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
position would be that yes the home
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
requires smoke detectors because that's
 
05:39:50.110 --> 05:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
the fire code but it would not require a
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
sprinkler because the residents would be
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
this the same situation as um two
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
separate families living in the duplex
 
05:40:04.350 --> 05:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
so that there shouldn't be any extra um
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
regulations placed upon a dwelling
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
merely because the occupants are people
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
in recovery um and are protected under
 
05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
the federal fair housing act and by the
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
way the state law against
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination thank you representative
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
Alro um I think this question is
 
05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
probably better for Mr pesi answer um
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
but anybody could chime in um I assume
 
05:40:32.030 --> 05:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
differences uh in the requirements of
 
05:40:36.750 --> 05:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
different structures and institutions
 
05:40:40.350 --> 05:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
for instance hotels versus U multiple
 
05:40:45.070 --> 05:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
dwellings and that sort of thing um and
 
05:40:49.548 --> 05:40:49.558 align:start position:0%
uh so the type of structure and many
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
other factors play in to the discretion
 
05:40:54.990 --> 05:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's used by the fire marshall
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
discretion or as uh might be worded
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh used by the file
 
05:41:02.430 --> 05:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
because discrimination is not a bad word
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
implicitly uh that discrimination so my
 
05:41:08.430 --> 05:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
question for Mr pricey or for yourself
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
is is that U
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
discretion not well warranted in the
 
05:41:16.030 --> 05:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
fire Marshall's decisions
 
05:41:18.910 --> 05:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
to um make different have different
 
05:41:21.150 --> 05:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for different structures
 
05:41:23.548 --> 05:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
and institutions
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
establishments Mr
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
pery thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:41:31.150 --> 05:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
the question sir um
 
05:41:33.430 --> 05:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is yes absolutely
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
there are different requirements
 
05:41:36.868 --> 05:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of people that
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
are in the building the type of
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
structure the number of floors the
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
number of exits all of that plays into
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
what the requirements are going to be I
 
05:41:47.110 --> 05:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
think one of the really important parts
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
about this this entire issue is
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we we came to this we got to this
 
05:41:56.590 --> 05:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
point at least I think we got to this
 
05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
point because the the folks that are in
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
recovery housing are disabled and
 
05:42:06.990 --> 05:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
therefore deserve it of an a reasonable
 
05:42:09.270 --> 05:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation and if they're deserv it
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
of a reasonable com so so ordinarily the
 
05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
way our posture is that because of the
 
05:42:19.390 --> 05:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
type of housing the type of structure
 
05:42:21.548 --> 05:42:21.558 align:start position:0%
the number of people in the house or
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
building uh the number of floors exits
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
and so forth often times fire sprinklers
 
05:42:26.958 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
and so forth often times fire sprinklers
are

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
required what we were tried to do or
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with this
 
05:42:35.548 --> 05:42:35.558 align:start position:0%
legislation is simply say we recognize
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
that a reasonable accommodation should
 
05:42:41.230 --> 05:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
be granted to these people so therefore
 
05:42:44.430 --> 05:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
we figured if we can mitigate some of
 
05:42:48.468 --> 05:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
the risk of a fire we can
 
05:42:51.468 --> 05:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
therefore grant them the reasonable
 
05:42:54.468 --> 05:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
accommodation from the sprinkler system
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
and still put a head on the pillow at
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
night knowing that they're going to be
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
relatively safe I I think that's it in a
 
05:43:01.868 --> 05:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
nutshell I hope that answers your
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
question if not I'll certainly be happy
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
to follow up thank
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
you other
 
05:43:11.948 --> 05:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
questions Roy and then represento I have
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
a question for fire M pery can you speak
 
05:43:18.030 --> 05:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
to this this allegation for lack of a
 
05:43:19.390 --> 05:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
better term that this is somehow a
 
05:43:19.400 --> 05:43:22.350 align:start position:0%
better term that this is somehow a
discriminatory

05:43:22.350 --> 05:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
policy thank you for the question
 
05:43:24.120 --> 05:43:26.230 align:start position:0%
policy thank you for the question
representative

05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:30.270 --> 05:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
I I am I can't and I can't because what
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is lessen the
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
restrictions not increase the
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions I I know it's it seems like
 
05:43:39.390 --> 05:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's getting turned around but we're
 
05:43:41.430 --> 05:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
simply I know it's a laundry list of
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
things but the important part to
 
05:43:45.868 --> 05:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
remember is that that laundry list of
 
05:43:48.310 --> 05:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
things only needs to be done if the if
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
the if the occupancy is requesting
 
05:43:54.070 --> 05:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
relief from an automatic fire sprinkler
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
system if they're not requesting that
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
this none of this comes into play
 
05:44:03.628 --> 05:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
now uh director box list comes into play
 
05:44:05.390 --> 05:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
because if they're going to be certified
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
certainly they need to follow that stuff
 
05:44:09.628 --> 05:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
but other than that we don't really get
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
involved if they're not requesting an
 
05:44:14.190 --> 05:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
exemption or or reasonable
 
05:44:17.830 --> 05:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation follow up um
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
so they've said that similarly situated
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
buildings that may house for example
 
05:44:27.390 --> 05:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
students or or what have you are not
 
05:44:29.868 --> 05:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
subjected to these requirements
 
05:44:32.670 --> 05:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
so are they subjected to the to the um
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
fire sprinkler
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
requirement yes sir they would be and
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
and and to just to add on to
 
05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
that I don't use this in a in a flip way
 
05:44:48.430 --> 05:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
but if an outlaw motorcycle gang came to
 
05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
us and said hey we want to you know not
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
put sprinkles in our in our clubhouse
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
but we're going to have 12 or 15 people
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
sleeping there we would like not
 
05:45:01.590 --> 05:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
entertain them because they're not
 
05:45:03.468 --> 05:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
disabled they they don't they don't they
 
05:45:05.230 --> 05:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
not deserve it of a reasonable
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
accommodation folks that are Sub in you
 
05:45:09.628 --> 05:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
know have suffer from substance use
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
disorder and in recovery they are
 
05:45:13.948 --> 05:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
deserving of that accommodation so
 
05:45:15.868 --> 05:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
therefore we're trying to Grant relief
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
not create more of a burden thank you
 
05:45:23.948 --> 05:45:23.958 align:start position:0%

committee represent Gro did you still
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:45:27.878 --> 05:45:29.788 align:start position:0%
have a
question

05:45:29.788 --> 05:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:45:32.190 --> 05:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative Roy
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%

fine thank
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
Pearson as did you hear anything I just
 
05:45:50.160 --> 05:45:51.788 align:start position:0%
Pearson as did you hear anything I just
said

05:45:51.788 --> 05:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
no uh looking at the attendance list
 
05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
here we have the fire chief of the city
 
05:45:58.990 --> 05:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
of Manchester on uh the attendees list
 
05:46:00.548 --> 05:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be for the
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee to hear what's going on
 
05:46:04.230 --> 05:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in his City in reference to
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
this issue well I was about to ask for
 
05:46:09.788 --> 05:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
for if anyone wish to testify but your
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.798 --> 05:46:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
goonan

05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
Chief you have to unmute yourself here
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
we go I'm I'm back I'm back I just I
 
05:46:40.110 --> 05:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
lost it for a second here um yeah uh I'm
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
sorry I came on a little bit late we've
 
05:46:43.708 --> 05:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
had some a couple issues here in town
 
05:46:45.468 --> 05:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't get to the uh the
 
05:46:47.590 --> 05:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
meeting in time but I appreciate you
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
letting me let me speak um yes uh I I
 
05:46:53.868 --> 05:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
fully support this bill uh we've been
 
05:46:57.910 --> 05:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
working on um this type of legislation
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
um for a long
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
time uh every time I speak in front of
 
05:47:06.270 --> 05:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
um a hearing or a committee um it it
 
05:47:08.430 --> 05:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
boggles my mind
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
to think how far we came away from the
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
traditional requirements of the fire
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
code to get to this point we're truly
 
05:47:20.910 --> 05:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make this easier uh to get
 
05:47:24.510 --> 05:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
some of these um buildings in and um
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
like the fire marshal said we still want
 
05:47:29.310 --> 05:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
to sleep at night we just want a a place
 
05:47:33.270 --> 05:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's reasonably safe uh for uh
 
05:47:35.070 --> 05:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
people you know I always say even a
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
protective protecting class deserves to
 
05:47:41.110 --> 05:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
sleep safely at night and uh you know
 
05:47:43.468 --> 05:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
some of the places that we see certainly
 
05:47:46.350 --> 05:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
are not safe um that's what keeps us up
 
05:47:52.350 --> 05:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
at night uh so um to to say that we're
 
05:47:55.150 --> 05:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
we're purposely trying to discriminate
 
05:47:57.070 --> 05:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate discriminate from a a
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
protected class just blow my mind we we
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't discriminate we treat all these
 
05:48:05.590 --> 05:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
buildings the same whether it's um uh
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's a rooming house or whether
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh uh folks from SS snhu uh
 
05:48:15.310 --> 05:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
occupying a single family home um you
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
know it it's I totally understand uh
 
05:48:22.590 --> 05:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
sober living I totally understand what
 
05:48:24.910 --> 05:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the opioid crisis and
 
05:48:26.708 --> 05:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
the drug crisis and the methamphetamine
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
crisis and the alcohol crisis and the
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
everything above crisis I get it I'm
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
150% in the middle of this thing you
 
05:48:35.910 --> 05:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
know I serve on some national committees
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
the National Institute on drug abuse uh
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
we speak about this all the time I am
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
100% in I just want people in my city um
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
in in the of course in the state to to
 
05:48:48.548 --> 05:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
just have a a safe place to go they
 
05:48:51.468 --> 05:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
deserve a safe place to go um when
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
they're in recovery that's that's what
 
05:48:56.830 --> 05:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
the the basics of this whole thing and
 
05:48:58.830 --> 05:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh with the help of the fire marshal
 
05:49:02.110 --> 05:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
we've come a long way uh to meeting
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're well past meeting halfway um
 
05:49:07.230 --> 05:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you know we've always
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is just a quick check sheet
 
05:49:11.030 --> 05:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
here you go you come in you just
 
05:49:13.150 --> 05:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
identify yourself as hey look I'm I've
 
05:49:16.190 --> 05:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
I've got this uh um a home it's going to
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
be a silver living home um we're on you
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
know one two3 debuk street and uh and
 
05:49:24.910 --> 05:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
and we would respond by saying here's
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
your check
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
sheet that's it you know we're not
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
asking for a whole lot more than what we
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
ask for your typical uh person with a
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
with a three family um we've seen a lot
 
05:49:41.150 --> 05:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
of Bad actors I understand that uh that
 
05:49:43.510 --> 05:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
n and New Hampshire core um you know are
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
working hard but you know you know
 
05:49:48.270 --> 05:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that everybody's
 
05:49:50.110 --> 05:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
going to play by the rules alls we want
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
to do is have a a basic set of safety
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
rules um that we can help people in help
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
people that want to run these agencies
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
in these uh these homes um help them
 
05:50:07.230 --> 05:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
open up uh not prevent them from opening
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
up uh you know that's that's basically
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
what we're coming you know what we're
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
where we're coming at this and and every
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
time I come up here I I just can't
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
believe it comes back down to always the
 
05:50:20.350 --> 05:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
same thing if unless you play by our
 
05:50:23.390 --> 05:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
rules 100% well there's going to be a
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit you know that's that's really
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
what it comes down
 
05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
to Chief I have a question if if I
 
05:50:34.110 --> 05:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly you're saying
 
05:50:36.030 --> 05:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
that you
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
support the requirements of this bill as
 
05:50:45.788 --> 05:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
a absolute bare minimum accommodations
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
required for safety for living in an old
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
building that doesn't have a spring
 
05:50:54.030 --> 05:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes um you know in I think
 
05:51:00.110 --> 05:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're even we're going above and beyond
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
you know accommodations for I we're
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
um trying to cut a piece of the fire
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
coat out just for these these folks that
 
05:51:11.430 --> 05:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
are um you know are are suffering from
 
05:51:13.868 --> 05:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
you know substitute disorder um but we
 
05:51:16.030 --> 05:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
really treat all the places the same I I
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
think this is this is a good set of
 
05:51:21.310 --> 05:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
minimum standards instead of dealing
 
05:51:23.948 --> 05:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
with recovery houses specifically we
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
should put into the fire code that you
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
know this is not recommended but it is
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
the absolute bare minimum if you want to
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
live in an old house with a without a
 
05:51:36.670 --> 05:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.548 --> 05:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
system because that's what you're trying
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
to do if I understand correctly
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yes living in an old house without
 
05:51:46.830 --> 05:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
a sprinkler system you're asking me if
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
this this would be uh kind of a minimum
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
standard I would agree with that okay
 
05:51:54.788 --> 05:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I wanted to
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
clarify that in my own mind other
 
05:51:58.868 --> 05:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative scitech
 
05:52:02.670 --> 05:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh your approval list Chief goonan
 
05:52:05.390 --> 05:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
does it insist or does it say that they
 
05:52:05.400 --> 05:52:06.270 align:start position:0%
does it insist or does it say that they
can't

05:52:06.270 --> 05:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:52:12.910 --> 05:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
sorry well I think that's that's one of
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
the things that do keep us up at night
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I think you you you'll find
 
05:52:22.030 --> 05:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
it statist statistically there's a lot
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
of folks smoking in some of these
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
buildings and we have an awful lot of uh
 
05:52:29.230 --> 05:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
tragic fires Rel reled to that I can
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
tell you I rolled in on a few of them
 
05:52:35.390 --> 05:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
myself alone uh this spring so yeah it's
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's um it's something that we deal with
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the larger cities yes
 
05:52:42.510 --> 05:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions one more
 
05:52:45.150 --> 05:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
follow Chief G I'm not sure this is for
 
05:52:49.468 --> 05:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
you it's maybe for uh Fire Marshall
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
paresi but I want to summarize or try to
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
summarize as the chair did just a moment
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
ago if there are any discriminatory
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
aspects in this it is because you are
 
05:53:05.910 --> 05:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make reasonable accommodations
 
05:53:08.310 --> 05:53:08.320 align:start position:0%

statement I if you're asking me I think
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%

representative
 
05:53:33.628 --> 05:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair um my question
 
05:53:36.868 --> 05:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
is for chief goonan um I think what
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson was hoping for
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
would be an example of what you are
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
seeing particularly in your city uh as a
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.270 --> 05:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
needed well I think in my city um we do
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
have a a quite a few in fact um this
 
05:54:04.590 --> 05:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
week seemed like a a big week of um
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
local residents identifying uh possible
 
05:54:10.750 --> 05:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
um buildings that are sober living
 
05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
buildings but yes we see kind of all the
 
05:54:15.150 --> 05:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
above uh we have some really good folks
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
that are um are in here in they'll for
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
instance we have we work with a few
 
05:54:23.430 --> 05:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
groups who will come to us first and say
 
05:54:26.190 --> 05:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
Chief uh in in Fire Marshall paresi it's
 
05:54:28.510 --> 05:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
the same group that that he sees a lot
 
05:54:32.910 --> 05:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
help us help us um open up help tell me
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
what you need for minimum standards so
 
05:54:37.230 --> 05:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of folks coming in here
 
05:54:39.990 --> 05:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
Meeting those minimum standards but
 
05:54:43.468 --> 05:54:43.478 align:start position:0%
because you don't have any any uh
 
05:54:47.868 --> 05:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
definitions or or any uh let's say
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
regulations besides having identifying
 
05:54:53.590 --> 05:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
people as rooming houses you know we
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
come go in there and say unfortunately
 
05:54:58.190 --> 05:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
you did a fantastic job with this
 
05:55:00.750 --> 05:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
building but because we have nothing
 
05:55:03.948 --> 05:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
else you're a rooming house you need a
 
05:55:06.628 --> 05:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
sprinkler or I have nothing else to do
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
but take action you know what I mean it
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's we're looking for some guidance in
 
05:55:16.270 --> 05:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
some um kind of relief because we don't
 
05:55:18.990 --> 05:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
want to do that to folks that are that
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
are um you know operating these these
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
buildings that are um that we think are
 
05:55:26.350 --> 05:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
you know relatively safe and they're
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
upfront and honest with us you know and
 
05:55:32.030 --> 05:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
and following uh New Hampshire um core
 
05:55:34.270 --> 05:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
and Nar and those folks because those
 
05:55:38.430 --> 05:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
are those are good um but uh we also
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
have people we you know I'll be notified
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
by my uh my officers as they go into
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
places hey chief do you realize you know
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
we have you know 30 people living in a
 
05:55:50.910 --> 05:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
three family you know and we're like we
 
05:55:52.670 --> 05:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
don't know and then we'll have to try to
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
start taking some action and and uh you
 
05:55:56.830 --> 05:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
know that's what keeps us up at night
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
because we just don't have any we don't
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
have any clue where these places are and
 
05:56:02.190 --> 05:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for a lot we're not
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for you to come in and
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
and and pay a fee we're not asking you
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
to come in and say you know you're got
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
to buy a$ th000 licensing fee so we're

up we'll we'll touch Bas with you the
 
05:56:17.270 --> 05:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
next year or we'll you know I'll send a
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
a fire company over just to do a quick
 
05:56:20.670 --> 05:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
check sheet make sure everything is
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%

05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
chief in Manchester you know can sleep a
 
05:56:28.830 --> 05:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
little bit better at night that's simple
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
than thank
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
Alro no I didn't have a question oh okay
 
05:56:37.628 --> 05:56:37.638 align:start position:0%
good repres
 
05:56:39.628 --> 05:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:56:41.948 --> 05:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
you Chief goon for uh for coming before
 
05:56:44.030 --> 05:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
the committee today and testifying your
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
your leadership in this has has been uh
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
has been very helpful you just touched
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
upon an interesting uh concept of of
 
05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
knowing simply knowing where these
 
05:56:53.638 --> 05:56:55.948 align:start position:0%
knowing simply knowing where these
locations

05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
locations
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
are that becomes
 
05:57:01.590 --> 05:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
Paramount or do you think it becomes
 
05:57:03.868 --> 05:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
Paramount even in the smaller rural
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
communities and not just in the city of
 
05:57:08.548 --> 05:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester where we have uh
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
substantially more fire
 
05:57:13.390 --> 05:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
resources I I do because what a lot of
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
stuff we do is is is pre-planning and
 
05:57:17.788 --> 05:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
and we we want to know our neighborhoods
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
our our our officers and our
 
05:57:21.390 --> 05:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh want to know what
 
05:57:24.430 --> 05:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
they're um what they're uh arriving to
 
05:57:26.350 --> 05:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of times when you if you
 
05:57:28.830 --> 05:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
arrive to a place that you think think
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know may have uh you know three
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
people in or a building that's uh on
 
05:57:37.150 --> 05:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
fire and you expect your normal you know
 
05:57:39.548 --> 05:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
three family with three four people in
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
or even a family with five people or
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
something like that and then all you you
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
show up and you got 10 people per floor
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
that's a problem for us and that'd be a
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
problem for any place in the in the
 
05:57:53.990 --> 05:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you are there other
 
05:58:00.750 --> 05:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:03.230 --> 05:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank everyone who came back
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%

representative
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I don't
 
05:58:14.430 --> 05:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question I was a
 
05:58:16.468 --> 05:58:16.478 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor so as a co-sponsor I just
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
like to speak briefly at the end
 
05:58:21.990 --> 05:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
here if I
 
05:58:24.430 --> 05:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
may um I just want to talk about a few
 
05:58:28.390 --> 05:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
points we heard earlier um about
 
05:58:30.468 --> 05:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Corp um it's an
 
05:58:32.788 --> 05:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
organization these
 
05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
recovery uh places are not required to
 
05:58:37.230 --> 05:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
register with them um they're an
 
05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
organization that goes around certifying
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that they certify but it is not
 
05:58:43.868 --> 05:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
a requirement to be a recovery house
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
05:58:45.120 --> 05:58:46.708 align:start position:0%
here in New
Hampshire

05:58:46.708 --> 05:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:58:49.510 --> 05:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
um also want to note that it was noted
 
05:58:52.868 --> 05:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
about UNH housing not needing sprinklers
 
05:58:55.590 --> 05:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's not true they would need
 
05:58:58.830 --> 05:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
Sprinklers and
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
this bill gives an exemption to recovery
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
houses from Sprinklers and so I'm not
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
sure how they think they are being
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
treated at a higher level when it's
 
05:59:14.350 --> 05:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
actually giving exemptions for um the
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
law and you know this this eliminates
 
05:59:19.150 --> 05:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
the need for for
 
05:59:22.910 --> 05:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
sprinklers um working in Manchester you
 
05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
know we I did see a number of places you
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
go on to call for a smoke detector
 
05:59:27.040 --> 05:59:28.190 align:start position:0%
go on to call for a smoke detector
activation

05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
activation
 
05:59:30.150 --> 05:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
you show up to a three family expecting
 
05:59:32.948 --> 05:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
six or seven people in that building and
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
you get 10 or 12 coming out piling out
 
05:59:36.600 --> 05:59:37.830 align:start position:0%
you get 10 or 12 coming out piling out
of

05:59:37.830 --> 05:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
rooms to be reported to our fire
 
05:59:41.390 --> 05:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
prevention when they go and find out and
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
they say they're a recovery
 
05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
house um I think it's important
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
that these added safety
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
measures are adopted and required if
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
these are going
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
to um work as it be a recovery house um
 
06:00:02.830 --> 06:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
the the other thing I did want to say is
 
06:00:04.670 --> 06:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
in speaking with
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh Fire Marshall
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:14.670 --> 06:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions but the issue is that goes
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
back on him when something
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
happens and someone gets injured or
 
06:00:22.030 --> 06:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
killed because he gave an
 
06:00:25.230 --> 06:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
exception whereas if we as legislators
 
06:00:27.628 --> 06:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
put it in statute gives him a little
 
06:00:29.628 --> 06:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
breathing room at night not knowing that
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
it wasn't on him it was in the statute
 
06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it's how we felt these places should
 
06:00:34.160 --> 06:00:35.150 align:start position:0%
and it's how we felt these places should
be

06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:00:37.788 --> 06:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
treated um and and I agree with him on
 
06:00:41.948 --> 06:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
that I I I truly agree that if he wanted
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
to or if it was someone else in his
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
position they could go around and say
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're not giving the exceptions and
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
could say you know fully go by the fire
 
06:00:51.390 --> 06:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
cat and put everything in so I hope the
 
06:00:54.670 --> 06:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee will uh vote this all to pass
 
06:00:56.628 --> 06:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say thank you
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
Jake Barry had asked to testify and he's
 
06:01:07.708 --> 06:01:07.718 align:start position:0%

name is Jake Barry I'm the vice
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
president of policy of new Futures as
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
many of you know new Futures is a non
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy and
 
06:01:24.590 --> 06:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization we've been working
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 years to address
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug issues in the
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
state I'll be brief I know you've
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussed this at length today uh new
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
future is not taking a formal position
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I do want to emphasize
 
06:01:36.510 --> 06:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
the sensitive and important nature of
 
06:01:38.670 --> 06:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
the issues around recovery housing I
 
06:01:40.270 --> 06:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
don't I know I don't need to tell you
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
that access to stable housing is one of
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
the most critical factors contributing
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
to long-term recovery from substance use
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
disorder and a lack of housing
 
06:01:48.750 --> 06:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
facilities is one of the biggest
 
06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
obstacles we face as a state in our
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
battle to overcome the ongoing addiction
 
06:01:55.110 --> 06:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
epidemic I certainly recognize that this
 
06:01:56.830 --> 06:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to help ensure the
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
safety and security of our recovery
 
06:02:00.670 --> 06:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
housing facilities and and certainly the
 
06:02:02.510 --> 06:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security of these houses and
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
their inhabitants is Paramount uh that
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
said the risk of fire or other
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies is not the only concern
 
06:02:10.830 --> 06:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
facing the individuals uh in these homes
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
as they seek to achieve long-term
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
recovery uh so I really want to thank
 
06:02:16.590 --> 06:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
the committee for the work you've done
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
today and and I hope you'll continue to
 
06:02:20.270 --> 06:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
ask tough questions and and dig deep to
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that there are not any unintended
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
consequences of this legislation that
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
could lead to the overregulation
 
06:02:28.830 --> 06:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
financial strain or unnecessary closure
 
06:02:31.310 --> 06:02:31.320 align:start position:0%

Pittsfield marac District 29 house bille
 
06:04:06.110 --> 06:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
369 was a request of the
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
oplc and in fact after
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
the occupational therapist board
 
06:04:14.830 --> 06:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed it they came up with an
 
06:04:19.150 --> 06:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
amendment number 2021
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
0185 which you should have
 
06:04:24.990 --> 06:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
already which replaces the entire
 
06:04:29.708 --> 06:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
bill and I defer all questions to the
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
oplc I believe miss Tom brck is their
 
06:04:50.030 --> 06:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:53.310 --> 06:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon I recognize Mr broadrick to
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:56.080 --> 06:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
bill

06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:04.670 --> 06:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
we have a copy of the amendment some it
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
number Mr chair could I just ask a
 
06:05:21.718 --> 06:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
number Mr chair could I just ask a
clarification

06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
06:05:27.430 --> 06:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure um the amendment that we got at the
 
06:05:31.350 --> 06:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
bottom says the bill is a request of the
 
06:05:34.430 --> 06:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure but I
 
06:05:37.150 --> 06:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
believe I just heard the sponsor say
 
06:05:39.868 --> 06:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
that the amendment was actually put
 
06:05:44.350 --> 06:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
forward by the individual board is that
 
06:05:47.788 --> 06:05:47.798 align:start position:0%
correct yes the board recommended it and
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's put forward by the oplc the board
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
is part of the oplc I realized that I
 
06:05:55.350 --> 06:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be sure the source of the
 
06:06:01.150 --> 06:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:05.548 --> 06:06:05.558 align:start position:0%
youc okay okay Mr brck you
 
06:06:07.468 --> 06:06:07.478 align:start position:0%
recognized good morning members of the
 
06:06:09.030 --> 06:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee or good afternoon I'm sorry I
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
was supposed to speak with you in the
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
morning um so I'm Tom broadrick legal
 
06:06:14.670 --> 06:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
council at the office of professional
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
liur and certification or oplc um just
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
for the record the oplc provides
 
06:06:22.150 --> 06:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
administrative and clerical Support
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping Services in business
 
06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
processing for the approximately 54
 
06:06:28.868 --> 06:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
licensing boards commissions and
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
councils under our umbrella so this bill
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
affects both oplc and one of the boards
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
we administer um the occupational
 
06:06:39.150 --> 06:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
therapy governing board uh I want to
 
06:06:41.230 --> 06:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
make clear right now I'm speaking on
 
06:06:43.948 --> 06:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
behalf of the oplc the agency only I'm
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
not speaking on behalf of the board um I
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
believe there's someone here from the
 
06:06:50.590 --> 06:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
board who's going to be testifying today
 
06:06:52.390 --> 06:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure though with a change in
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
time if they're still able to do so um
 
06:06:58.910 --> 06:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
So currently without this bill if
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists or OTS or
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist assistants or
 
06:07:07.270 --> 06:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
OTAs wish to perform what are called
 
06:07:10.468 --> 06:07:10.478 align:start position:0%
physical agent modalities or pams you'll
 
06:07:13.070 --> 06:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
probably hear these terms thrown around
 
06:07:14.948 --> 06:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
they must first obtain a cert
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
certification from the board before
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
doing so a Pam certification so this
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill will remove their requirement for
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
OTS and OTAs to obtain that
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
certification before they can perform
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
the pan
 
06:07:29.750 --> 06:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing here is really we're
 
06:07:33.510 --> 06:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
removing a level an additional level of
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
certification uh the bill was introduced
 
06:07:38.030 --> 06:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
last legislative session uh it was
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
sidelined due to the pandemic it was a
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
Senate bill it passed through the Senate
 
06:07:43.708 --> 06:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
but I believe it was tabled in the house
 
06:07:47.070 --> 06:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic um the OT board had
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
requested of oplc that we put forward
 
06:07:53.948 --> 06:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
this bill again um and and so that's why
 
06:07:56.190 --> 06:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
we did the oplc is in support of this
 
06:07:58.910 --> 06:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
the the bill in our view it'll save
 
06:08:01.070 --> 06:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
staff resources while also adequately
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the public so the bill will
 
06:08:05.468 --> 06:08:05.478 align:start position:0%
save staff resources because there's
 
06:08:06.868 --> 06:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's just one going to be one less
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
type of certificate to issue um less
 
06:08:12.510 --> 06:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
applications etc for the agency to track
 
06:08:15.070 --> 06:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
in the board to Grant or deny um we
 
06:08:16.750 --> 06:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
believe it still adequately protects the
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
public I think there's likely some otes
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
here who can testify more as to the
 
06:08:23.548 --> 06:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
actual practice of physical agent
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
modalities better than I could but I'll
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
note that the board still retains some
 
06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
rulle making authority over the practice
 
06:08:29.200 --> 06:08:30.310 align:start position:0%
rulle making authority over the practice
of

06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
pams with regards to the amendment um so
 
06:08:36.390 --> 06:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
oplc are our agency we're not taking a
 
06:08:39.390 --> 06:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
position for or against the amendment um
 
06:08:41.070 --> 06:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment would further clarify the
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
board's rulemaking Authority regarding
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
pams which I'd be in support of in my
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
role at the oplc but the other two
 
06:08:48.910 --> 06:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
changes have more to do with the
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
practice of Occupational Therapy rather
 
06:08:54.030 --> 06:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
than lure requirements or
 
06:08:55.948 --> 06:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
Administration um and for that reason
 
06:08:58.110 --> 06:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
oplc isn't taking a
 
06:09:01.230 --> 06:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
position um that's all for of my
 
06:09:02.788 --> 06:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
prepared comments but I'm happy to take
 
06:09:02.798 --> 06:09:05.510 align:start position:0%
prepared comments but I'm happy to take
any

06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.390 --> 06:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from s
 
06:09:12.750 --> 06:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
BR I do I'm not sure if he's the best
 
06:09:15.788 --> 06:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
person but um I'd like to get at least
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
some idea of the sorts of things which
 
06:09:21.788 --> 06:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
are um whatever the term is the the
 
06:09:23.708 --> 06:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
modalities I mean I was aware of
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and the electrical but you
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
know what other things are there yeah I
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
I am hoping that there are some
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists on to testify as
 
06:09:37.628 --> 06:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
to more specifics I as I said I know a
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
board member was planning on being there
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding um as an attorney you
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
know and I have 54 boards I work with so
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know everything about all the
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
professions um is that these are um an
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
OT or otaa can perform these um some of
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
the modalities that a physical
 
06:09:59.190 --> 06:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
therapists would normally perform so
 
06:10:01.948 --> 06:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
long as it's uh in the course of them
 
06:10:06.070 --> 06:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
providing their OT treatment um so I
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly um what those are but

previously received written testimony
 
06:13:39.030 --> 06:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
from Olivia R Freeman chairman of the
 
06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy board I am an
 
06:13:44.430 --> 06:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy member as well as a
 
06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
board member with 14 years of experience
 
06:13:49.750 --> 06:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill will allow OT
 
06:13:51.628 --> 06:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
professionals to practice to the full
 
06:13:55.190 --> 06:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
extent of our licenses and our education
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
the need for an additional certification
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
as it stands does a great disservice to
 
06:14:01.990 --> 06:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
our profession the patients the clients
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
and all populations which we seek to
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
serve OT is a holistic discipline which
 
06:14:10.110 --> 06:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
attracts many people to this profession
 
06:14:12.070 --> 06:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
the treatment of skilled occupational
 
06:14:14.230 --> 06:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
therapy with the use of physical agent
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
modalities also known as pams can
 
06:14:19.390 --> 06:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
promote greater quality of life improve
 
06:14:22.590 --> 06:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
patient outcomes and in many situations
 
06:14:25.750 --> 06:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
decrease pain there are only currently
 
06:14:28.350 --> 06:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
approxim imely a dozen other states that
 
06:14:31.310 --> 06:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
require additional pams certifications
 
06:14:33.310 --> 06:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire being one of
 
06:14:35.788 --> 06:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
them the elimination of the additional
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
certification would allow for
 
06:14:39.548 --> 06:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
streamlined licensing requirements to
 
06:14:41.788 --> 06:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
protect public health and Public Safety
 
06:14:45.190 --> 06:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
and interest and may uh and may provide
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
indeterminate cost savings associated
 
06:14:49.548 --> 06:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of staff and board
 
06:14:51.190 --> 06:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
time to process the request for
 
06:14:51.200 --> 06:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
