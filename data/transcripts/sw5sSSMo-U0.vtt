and the chair recognizes the prime
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%

coming
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Cindy Rosenwald I
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over that period will receive
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
more than 300 million dollars to
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
mitigate the harms of the opioid
 
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
mitigate the harms of the opioid
epidemic

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:01.579 align:start position:0%
when we receive a check from one of the
 
00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:06.019 align:start position:0%
companies that we're in litigation with
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
15 percent of that money goes out
 
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.100 align:start position:0%
immediately to 23 litigating
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
subdivisions as counties and its cities
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
and towns the balance goes into the fund
 
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
none of the money goes to the state the
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
opioid and payment advisory commission
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility and authority to
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
Grant these monies for a variety of
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
purposes that are laid out in statute
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
there are 22 members on the commission
 
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:42.260 align:start position:0%
and they represent subject matter
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
experts HHS Corrections the Department
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
of Justice County attorneys the
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs Physicians Specialists and
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
County and Municipal governments
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
we held our first round of Grant
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
applications last fall for 6.7 6.6
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
million dollars and at the beginning of
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
this month 14 contracts were awarded by
 
00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:17.899 align:start position:0%
the executive Council for six 6.5
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars there's one outstanding
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
contract that's not quite finished
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
since that first round more money has
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
come into the fund and we're just about
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
to close an RGA for at least five
 
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Grants to reimburse
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
the cost of medications
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
to treat substance use disorder
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
to reimburse those question can I
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
interrupt it so what's an RGA I'm sorry
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
a request for Grant application
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
um the so this bill comes out of our
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
experience in soliciting and awarding
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
grants over the past year does several
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
things first it establishes a
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that we give out grants of
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
at least five million dollars at least
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
so as long as there is at least five
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the fund we have to
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
give out grants at least once a year and
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
we have to collaborate with HHS on the
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
number of times that we will do this in
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
a year if we go beyond two or three it's
 
00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:38.779 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
really overwhelming for the Department
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
and I should note that it's very likely
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's going to be at least five
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars in this fund every year
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
for the next 18 years because of the way
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
the settlements are structured
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
but currently there's no statutory
 
00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
language about this it's dealt with in
 
00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.530 align:start position:0%
language about this it's dealt with in
rules

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
second the bill clarifies and makes a
 
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
couple of additions to eligibility
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
categories for Grants
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
these are recommendations from the
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts it expands the
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for medications for a
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment to
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
recognize that naloxone is not the only
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
FDA approved substance
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
and finally it updates language to
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
reflect best practices in the field and
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
fixes a couple of typos in the
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
underlying statute so I'd be happy to
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
attorney buffetti who has negotiated all
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
these settlements at Justice is also
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
here and he's he's really the subject
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
matter expert but I'm happy to answer
 
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.670 align:start position:0%
matter expert but I'm happy to answer
questions

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator um so of
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
course we're the second committee on
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
this so we will not be discussing the
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
underlying policy and we thank you for
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
all your hard work on that
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to be focused more on
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
the money side of things could you just
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
explain where do the 5 million come from
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
what what was the decision I want why
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
not three million why not 6 million
 
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.990 align:start position:0%
not three million why not 6 million
um

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
we decided so we had about
 
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.930 align:start position:0%
we decided so we had about
30

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the fund some of that is from
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
multi-year settlements but a big chunk
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
of it was from a one-time settlement
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
from Johnson and Johnson we didn't want
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
um we didn't want to start funding
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
programs that would ultimately not be
 
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.050 align:start position:0%
programs that would ultimately not be
sustainable

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
so we thought five million dollars was
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable but we allowed the department
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
to increase that number we have not yet
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
seen what the total request
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
will be let me say that in the fall when
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
we went out to be on 6.6 million dollars
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
we got 24 million dollars in requests so
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
there's a huge need out there we think a
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
lot of the reimbursement requests will
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
be for County Corrections
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
for the cost of treating their
 
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:38.180 align:start position:0%
um in their inmates
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
with either naloxone or
 
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:45.860 align:start position:0%
um buprenorphine or
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
methadone but it won't only be counties
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
there may be some local
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions as well so we might be
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
able to decide to give out
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
up to 10 million
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much it was really just
 
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
yes I saw that you were reading do do
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of that
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.870 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of that
um

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
and do I can leave this with you thank
 
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
and do I can leave this with you thank
you

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee for the
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
senator representative self-worth yes
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for all your efforts
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
um very important topic for me I've
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
heard in many meetings of the need
 
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
especially smaller communities to get
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the Narcan and those
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
other kind of treatments but I also know
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
grants are very complicated so I'm
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
hoping eventually there'll be an easy
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
way for them to access that if they
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
aren't a community that necessarily to a
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
really big Grant
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
so so that is part of our learning
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
experience our first round of Grant
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
applications we had a very long
 
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.029 align:start position:0%
applications we had a very long
application

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
and we have determined that we're going
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
to work to have
 
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.350 align:start position:0%
to work to have
shorter

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
applications and also by targeting
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
some of the rounds like the one we're
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
doing right now is reimbursement only
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
the one we did last fall was for any of
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
the approved uses it will be easier I
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
believe for smaller communities to apply
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement or or any other Grant
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
that we go out with I think we'll be
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
going out with grants again later this
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
year and probably discussing it
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
next in two weeks as our next meeting
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
oh thank you I do think that that
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
flexibility will really be helpful
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
especially if that's the main thing a
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
community needs is Narcan reimbursement
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
because of course it can be very
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
expensive that if they know that's
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
something they can apply for I just
 
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:57.980 align:start position:0%
think it would ease some of the stress
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you some of those communities may
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
have applied during this round that's
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
just about to close but we don't
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
no yet
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
what has been applied for
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
both representative uh I need to be
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
close I need to bring it closer on that
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
reminded me of something that I've been
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
meaning to ask about dhhs's Grant making
 
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
meaning to ask about dhhs's Grant making
process

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
there was a number of years ago our
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
senior center was having to send three
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
digital and I think it was 30 paper
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
copies of each application that they
 
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:48.860 align:start position:0%
made to DHHS
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
we seem to have had to promote paper
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
pushers when we when after the Great
 
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.270 align:start position:0%
pushers when we when after the Great
Recession

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
Recession
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's been fixed I'm not
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
aware that we were acquired anybody to
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
submit multiple paper copies could you
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative run
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
um are there any administrative costs
 
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
that are taken out of this fund and if
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
so what's the percentage yes that's a
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
great question we agreed to fund one
 
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
great question we agreed to fund one
um

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
staff person
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
was between 85 000 and a hundred
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
thousand a year all in with Benefits the
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
department has been asking for several
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
more staff people we have been reluctant
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
that request it's a big request we might
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
we might decide to fund one more but we
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
haven't come to agreement because we
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
really want the money
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
to go to mitigate the harms not to
 
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.029 align:start position:0%
to go to mitigate the harms not to
hire

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
hire
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
staff the governor's Commission on
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs which spends
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
between I think 11 and 12 million
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a year has one staff person so
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:39.740 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question today
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in the Grant application
 
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.930 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in the Grant application
process

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
uh is when when one organization applies
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
or money is the grant uh
 
00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:56.230 align:start position:0%
or money is the grant uh
a

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
standard form with specific questions
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
and that everybody gets or is the Grant
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
application uh
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
something that these organizations
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
make their own case for uh and it's free
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
form uh process in other words I don't
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
know if I'm asking the question quite
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
right but I
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
is it is it this question and this
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
question and this question in this
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
question I think I understand her
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
question we had a standard application
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and we knocked out a couple of
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
applicants because they were not in good
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
standing with the
 
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.649 align:start position:0%
standing with the
um

00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
with was it the Secretary of State
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit so a couple of
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
organizations applied and we just said
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
you know you're forget it we're not even
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
going to consider any non-profit that's
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
not in good standing with charitable
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
trust we're not going to give this money
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
to get your house in order but we've had
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
a standard application
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're going to try
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
and make shorter thank you
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
representative spilsber thank you madam
 
00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:16.210 align:start position:0%
representative spilsber thank you madam
chair

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.220 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
Senator I just want to make sure uh that
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
I understand the legislative intent from
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
your perspective as the sponsor
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
so the five million dollars
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
is addressed in two sentences in the
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
first paragraph So This is
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill lines six
 
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:37.820 align:start position:0%
through ten
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
what I understood you to say is that you
 
00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:44.539 align:start position:0%
are wanting the legislative instruction
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
that at least 5 million be granted each
 
00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:49.850 align:start position:0%
that at least 5 million be granted each
year

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
what this language appears to say is
 
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.169 align:start position:0%
what this language appears to say is
that

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
grants will be made without specifying
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
in any year that the balance exceeds 5
 
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.029 align:start position:0%
in any year that the balance exceeds 5
million

00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
that leaves me with two questions
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
the first question is where does it say
 
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
the first question is where does it say
that

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
at least 5 million should be granted
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
and should it say that is that your yeah
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think I misspoke it it says you're
 
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
I think I misspoke it it says you're
right

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
as long as there is at least five
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
million in the fund every year we would
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
go out to
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
solicit applications at least once
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say that we have to give
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
out five million there might be a year
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
where we only have five million and we
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
decide to bid out four
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
so I think we were comfortable with this
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
so you're comfortable with what it says
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes and it didn't necessarily have to be
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
a minimum it does it does not okay cjhs
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
was concerned that we would decide oh
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
let's go out to bid every quarter
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
and that would be too much work if
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
you're happy with it I'm happy we're
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
happy with it second second question
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
then it looks to me uh given the pace of
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
settlements that uh we won't be below 5
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
million uh in any given year anytime
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
soon but at some point down the road as
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
this moves into the 10 to 18 year range
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh what does this language indicate in
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
terms of a year in which maybe there was
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
only three or four million in the fund
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
does it mean nothing can be granted in
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
such a year
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's what it seems to say I don't I
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
don't think so it just means we don't
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
so the requirement is us as if there's
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
at least five million we have to give
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
out grants at least once a year okay so
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're you I get what you're saying
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
shall solicit applications is an
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
instruction if there are five million or
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
more you would not want it to be the
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
case that if there were only three
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
million in the funds no grants could be
 
00:26:06.659 --> 00:26:07.610 align:start position:0%
million in the funds no grants could be
made

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
right no I think because we might want
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
to spend what you have yeah right okay
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we could change it in 15 years from
 
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.049 align:start position:0%
and we could change it in 15 years from
now

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm glad to have your
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy did you have
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
another question yes thank you uh Madam
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
chair thank you again Senator uh earlier
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
in the in your testimony you mentioned a
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
number of 35 million dollars and I don't
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
know if I heard this correctly or that I
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
thought I heard that you have 35 million
 
00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.020 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
fund now is that that's correct attorney
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
Buffet has the exact numbers but it's
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere around that because we got a
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
one-time settlement from Johnson and
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
Johnson that's not going to be paid out
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
over 18 years so some of the money
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's in the fund is the first payment
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 or 20. and some of it is lump
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
sum I think we're about to get a
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
one-time payment from Walmart
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
also but
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
if we give out all of that money right
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
away then
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be funding
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
sustainable programs so we've tried to
 
00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.830 align:start position:0%
sustainable programs so we've tried to
be

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.570 align:start position:0%
be
um

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:43.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:46.820 align:start position:0%
realistic we haven't given out
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily one-year grants we've said
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
give us an application for something you
 
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.220 align:start position:0%
would do over two years or three years
 
00:27:59.169 --> 00:27:59.179 align:start position:0%
so we want to work with the requesters
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the harms but in a way that
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
is sustainable we have not yet
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity as a commission to
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
say how much do we want to set aside
 
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:19.700 align:start position:0%
for the future and give out
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
more slowly
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
follow up so that's why you're
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
protecting that Corpus of 35 million at
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
this point just for now okay yep thank
 
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.570 align:start position:0%
this point just for now okay yep thank
you

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth uh thanks
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question you
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
partially answered it again I was a
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
counselor by trade so I know this is a
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
gigantic problem uh very complicated uh
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
and even 10 years we're probably talking
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
20 but um as far as dealing with it if
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
not almost forever it seems like what
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
you're looking for in this is you really
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
need flexibility on the financial side
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
because you really you know as a
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
commission don't really know what you're
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
getting into I mean in some some of
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
what's going to work you know how much
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
each uh
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to work on the problem costs I
 
00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:14.659 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like you really need
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility as a commission and probably
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
might even come back to us at some point
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
um we do we want both flexibility but we
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
also want a statutory requirement so
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
that there's transparency of we're going
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be giving out money at least once a
 
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
year when we have a decent amount so
 
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
year when we have a decent amount so
that

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
the public knows
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing with it and that
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
that statutory Authority has not been
 
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.610 align:start position:0%
that statutory Authority has not been
there

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.789 align:start position:0%
there
then

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to run off okay across
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
the street but um I'm going to give
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative but my thank you we
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mr buffetti from the doj is here would
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
you want to come up and maybe answer
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of the questions we heard earlier
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind happy to welcome thank
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
you very much uh for the record my name
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
is James buffetti I am the deputy
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
Attorney General
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
for since 2015 I have been the state's
 
00:30:29.649 --> 00:30:29.659 align:start position:0%
lead prosecutor Prosecuting uh our
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
claims against opioid companies
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
I think that's it's probably best to
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
think of these as separate settlements
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
each one was separate some of them came
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
out of bankruptcy courts some of them
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
have yet to be resolved in bankruptcy
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
courts most infamously Purdue farmer
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
which is uh which is tied up in
 
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy litigation in the second
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
circuit uh I can tell you that
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
to date we have received
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
slightly over 45 million dollars in
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
opioid money
 
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:12.620 align:start position:0%
as the senator says the statute
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
requires that 15 percent
 
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:19.220 align:start position:0%
off the top of whatever money we receive
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
goes to 23 subdivisions
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties and 13 cities and towns
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
why do they get the money they get the
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
money because they hired outside Council
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
from out of state to file their own
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
opioid cases in federal court
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
and because of that the legislature
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
determined that they should and only
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
they should share in this uh in the 15
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
percent and it's done by population
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
so today to date we've received uh I'm
 
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
sorry we have sent out
 
00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:05.059 align:start position:0%
6.842 million dollars to the 23
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and that money's already
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
out that money is already in their hands
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
and they are doing various things with
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
that many of the counties are using the
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
money to help with their cost of
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment uh which
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
is the probably the most effective
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
treatment for people who are suffering
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
from an opioid use disorder
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
currently in the uh in the opioid uh
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
trust fund it's a dedicated trust fund
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
there was 31.7 million dollars if you
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
deduct that 6.5 million that was just
 
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:46.700 align:start position:0%
recently granted
 
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.020 align:start position:0%
to those uh those those
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
organizations that were able to get
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
grants approved by the governor and
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
executive Council so that's 31 million
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
dollars as the senator
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
said we will receive these payments in
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
different amounts in different times
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
over the next uh 17 years I think it's
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
fairly it's it's it's a fairly sure
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
thing that we'll receive at least five
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
million probably much more than that for
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
that entire time
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the largest settlement was with the
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
three major drug Distributors uh
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
McKesson Cardinal Health and Amerisource
 
00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:32.029 align:start position:0%
McKesson Cardinal Health and Amerisource
Bergen

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
Bergen
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
that um that was a hundred and
 
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:39.549 align:start position:0%
that um that was a hundred and
uh

00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
112 million dollars over 18 years so
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to come in at about five and
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars a year I think
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
there is some some variation depending
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the terms of the settlement
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
um we also have just uh just at the end
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
stages of settling with
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
um CVS Walgreens Walmart and two uh of
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
the major manufacturers company called
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
Teva and a company called Allegan
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
those settlements are various amounts
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
over various uh various periods of time
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that's a hundred million dollars
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
just for those five settlements as this
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
as the senator said if the Walmart
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
settlement is finalized and we should
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
expect to receive about fifteen and a
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
half million dollars sometime this year
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
half million dollars sometime this year
alone

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer that's a lot I'm
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
sorry there's a lot of of of information
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
about where this money comes from uh
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
these settlements
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and what we can anticipate the
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
senator is correct I think that the
 
00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
estimate is in total when this is all
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
said and done the state will receive
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
slightly over 300 million dollars over
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much are are you
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the 5 million and the
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
way this is worded is that situation I
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
could also say I'm also a member of the
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission so we've
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
worked closely with that group it's a
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's a diverse group and um I'm
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it uh it's a commission
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's working well uh I I think that
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
the the questions about you know the
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
timing and the amount and I think it
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's meant for some flexibility
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
um we should anticipate at least one
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
round of Grant applications a year I
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
think it's probably more like two or
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
three that we can do we part of that
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
limitation is the amount of work it
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
takes for HHS and their contracts unit
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
to actually do this work and to make
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is done properly
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that the money is being
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose for which it was
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
intended and that takes a lot of
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
resources but I think once once we get
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
into the groove I think that we should
 
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
anticipate at least two or three Grant
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
applications a year so that the object
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
is obviously to get this money out as
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can and to use it for
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement purposes and no other
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
purposes uh it was from from the
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
beginning of this case there was there
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
was strong intent by the by the AGS
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
across the country that this money be
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
dedicated for opioid abatement purposes
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
and not be diverted into other other
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
things so I think the goal is to get the
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
money out as quickly as we can so that
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
it can get into our communities and to
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
help people struggling with opioid use
 
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.650 align:start position:0%
help people struggling with opioid use
disorder

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you are you open to questions of
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
course uh yes representative Bolton
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
um this may not be in your bailiwick but
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
regarding the one staff person that DHHS
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
will receive
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
what would the function of that be and
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like if they're handling all
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
the grant applications that are coming
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
in perhaps reviewing them and bringing
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the commit the commission
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
um is that it or so so I I have to
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
correct Senator she was
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
she has been dedicated to the Senate
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee work the last couple
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
of meetings she missed the last meeting
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
in the last meeting the commission
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
agreed to a second position
 
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and um the the chair so the chair of
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on alcohol was
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
there he's on the commission as well he
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
has pledged to try and find funding for
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
at least one more position through the
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it's it's it's
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
easiest to think of these as what
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
happens up front as these Grant
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
applications are being received and
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh and then what happens at the
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
at the other end when that money is
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
going out and there has to be some sort
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
of an audit function so these two people
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
will be on either end probably working
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
together on all of it but we'll make
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
sure that these that each Grant
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
application has to be carefully screened
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
uh and then presented to the commission
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then when that money goes out then
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
there needs to be somebody that is
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
checking on it to see that it's being
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
properly used and that the organization
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's using it has the ability to do
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
what they say that they're going to do
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
and it's I mean this is at the end this
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
is you know this is New Hampshire's
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
money and we want to make sure that it's
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
being used wisely properly and it's
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to the to the best effect
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
the alcohol and drug other drugs I don't
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
think that's its actual name but it is
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
actually it's the community on Alcohol
 
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:53.540 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
over time I was there when it started
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
um they they are working on the wider
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
part not just other drugs but also an
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol but on more on prevention and
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
and on education and one of the problems
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
with concentrating just on nalaxon and
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's and the others is that
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
um people take it and then go straight
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
back to using again and take it again
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
and again and their brains go fuzzy from
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
what I understand on
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
are are you collaborating with is is the
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
commission collaborating with that
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
commission uh in terms of joint strategy
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
or are you going to
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and um
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
it it's actually in the bill that
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
Senator uh put together that um there is
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
a requirement now that the commission
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
Works in coordination with the
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
governor's commission uh and it's on in
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
the first section uh line 13. so um and
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
there are many of us that are on both
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
commissions so
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
um there has been a concerted effort to
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
get as much coordination as we can on
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
this issue about how to best use the
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
money to the best effect so we we're
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
we're obligated and we had been anyway
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
to talk to the governance commission to
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
talk to the the the the the governance
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator on drugs uh Chief Mara to
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
talk to uh as many as we can to make
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
sure that we
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
um that we can figure out what are the
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
best strategies to use this money and
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
the the statute that created the opioid
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
abatement Commission
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
has about 14 approved uses including
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment transportation to
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
treatment transitional housing coming
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
out of treatment so my guess is that
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
they will also be um some some
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
applications for prevention work in the
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
schools last year the legislature
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
amended the statute to to specifically
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
allow for prevention uh work being done
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
in in our schools
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and so I anticipate as things go on
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
that there will be applications to the
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
commission for those kinds of projects
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so you may also be working in
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
creating safe houses for people that are
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
coming out of treatment that badly need
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
not to be in drug infested yes so so I
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you that for instance in this
 
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:40.460 align:start position:0%
last round
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County is in the in is is in
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the process of rehabbing a building
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
close to their jail for transitional
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
housing and
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so and Sullivan County is one of
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
those counties that receives the chair
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the 15 but in addition
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
we authorized a grant of about a half a
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
million dollars to help them with this
 
00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
million dollars to help them with this
project

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.370 align:start position:0%
project
um

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know the experts that that do this
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh tell us that housing transitional
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
housing is a is a key need so I think we
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we address that
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
um and provide options for people that
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
need it the other one of the other key
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
needs uh in the North country was
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from treatment and
 
00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:34.220 align:start position:0%
so one of the grants that we that we uh
 
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
authorized was for a non-profit to
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
purchase two Vans solely for the purpose
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
of transporting people to and from
 
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.550 align:start position:0%
of transporting people to and from
treatment

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that if if
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
somebody needs it they have available
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
treatment that they can get to in a
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time you know New
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at one point we were we had
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
the second highest overdose deaths in
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
just after West Virginia which is not
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
something to be proud of and so and that
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
was many years ago we've done an awful
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
lot of work to address that issue and
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
that number has come significantly down
 
00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.010 align:start position:0%
that number has come significantly down
um

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
we we um we we opened up these doorways
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
programs in mostly in hospitals so that
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
people can get to a treatment provider
 
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.380 align:start position:0%
quickly and get connected with services
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
and we've done a lot but we need to make
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
sure that if if somebody needs it they
 
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
can get to treatment quickly and then
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
they don't overdose uh overdose deaths
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
are still on the rise uh and this a lot
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
of work to be done uh to to address that
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
but I think we've made progress and we
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
need to just figure out how we can
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
continue doing that what is the greatest
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
need and that's going to change over
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
time as this crisis changes and so the
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
commission needs to be flexible again
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
needs to talk to the governance
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
commission needs to figure out what is
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
what what are the best strategies for
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
now to to address the crisis as we see
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
it and then try and fund programs that
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
that do that
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for the context you've
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
been giving us I so want to follow up a
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
little more uh about the cost of the
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
medicines like Narcan because I know
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
might have been a year ago I was in a
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
meeting and you might have even been
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
there where a number of people were
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
saying can't you just pay for the Narcan
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
or whatever I assume probably you
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
haven't made a decision yet about to
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
what extent you're going to pay for
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
those things but I wondered if you have
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
a sense yet of what actually would be
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
the annual cost to support New Hampshire
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
communities and that one part of the
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
program I don't that's a good question
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I don't know I
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
think we're going to find out when we
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
see this this this next round of Grant
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
applications coming in so this this
 
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:06.500 align:start position:0%
Grant application was specifically
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
designed for the reimbursement of
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
naloxone and for for suboxone so it was
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
and it's geared toward you know cities
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
and towns counties who are who are
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
having to use this I mean one of the
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh reasons that I overdose
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
death rate has come down is the amount
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
of naloxone but nalox let's be clear
 
00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:30.859 align:start position:0%
naloxone is not a treatment drug
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
naloxone is a rescue drug it prevents
 
00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:37.579 align:start position:0%
people from dying on the spot because
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
opioids have an effect of suppressing a
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
person's respiratory system so it if you
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
have a seat there's a very actually
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
YouTube videos and you can see an actual
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
patient being given naloxone and they
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
come back to life
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
um and so but they're but they're
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
critical right and then the hope is that
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
you can now get them into treatment so
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
that they don't overdose again but
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's a cost and so a lot of a lot of
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
First Responders have it but there's
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
also been a lot of work being done by
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
HHS to make naloxone available to people
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
who have an opioid script so you know it
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
it should be that if you're if you're
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
properly on an opioid prescription that
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
you be given the option to also get
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
naloxone to carry in your in your pocket
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
like an EpiPen so that if something
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
happens you have something to to use uh
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
and and so I think I think we'll find
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
out how many how many people apply for
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
that and how much that is
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
but it's gonna be it's gonna be
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
um millions of dollars I think follow-up
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
yup I've at least for me um it would be
 
00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:51.530 align:start position:0%
yup I've at least for me um it would be
great

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
um if we could um have figures on what
 
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.069 align:start position:0%
um if we could um have figures on what
if

00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
um these grants covered all of the
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
rescue drugs it may be if that could be
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
a category because I just think that's
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
where I'm hearing a lot of things about
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
people really wanting to use them but
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
also wanting to know that there's a
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
reimbursement especially in smaller
 
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.849 align:start position:0%
reimbursement especially in smaller
communities

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be important data
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
to have uh as because you know there was
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
a there was tracking that he's been
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's being done by the department of
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
safety of of the amount of naloxone that
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
is given out uh so we we it's it's not
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
perfect data but we have some data and
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
indicating that it's actually you know
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
been significant and it has had an
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
important effect on on helping um uh get
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
that overdose death uh rate down
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is more comment than a question
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
question but I just wanted to thank you
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
for your extraordinary work producing
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
over 300 million dollars with of course
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
many others at your side I recognize
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
that but it is extraordinary and uh
 
00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
perhaps a drop in the bucket when we
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
consider the magnitude of the issue that
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're trying to address intelligently
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
and with the help of all the others that
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
are on the commission so many thanks
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if you can give me a
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
clarification on what was being said
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
about Staffing because is that in some
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
other part of the RSA because the part
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at doesn't say
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
anything about paying for administrative
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
costs it it doesn't that's a good
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
question it's not in the the bill it was
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated that there would be some
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
um simply because you just can't you
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
can't award this money and do it
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
properly without some administrative
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
costs so the commission had voted to uh
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
to recommend that we have that HHS hire
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
two people one's already been hired and
 
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
so are how are you how are those people
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
going to be paid are they supposed to be
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
paid out of this fund or it does it it
 
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.589 align:start position:0%
paid out of this fund or it does it it
doesn't

00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
is it in some other part of the statute
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
because this part here doesn't have any
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
provision for paying a state stat
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
staffer it it is not in this in the
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
statute there's no mention of it in the
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
statute as it currently exists there's
 
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:32.420 align:start position:0%
no mention for the the payment of
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative ulery and then
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative Susan almi
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
um probably one of the few people in
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
who's actually administered naloxone
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and it does work rapidly however I've
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
also administered it to the same person
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
more than four times sadly yeah does the
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
department do does anyone anywhere have
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
any record as to how many times that's
 
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.390 align:start position:0%
any record as to how many times that's
because

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
how many times have been multiple
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
applications of that emergency drug to
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the same person
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
my experience in the field was
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
no one takes
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
the the treatment which has some of the
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
same parameters as alcoholism having to
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
reach bottom Etc uh as seriously because
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
they're not facing death because I'll
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
get a shot and I'll be saved
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh as an excuse right in their in their
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
own mind so are there any records on
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
that no and and
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
um so safety has they have some records
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
as I said it was not perfect data of the
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
amount of doses of naloxone that has
 
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
reported to them that's been
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
administered but they don't have data
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure they could do it they
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
don't have data on how many doses have
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
been given to uh to the same person
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
and get
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah because oftentimes depending
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
upon transport time because it's it's a
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
short-acting uh drug that's a short
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
period of time and there may be multiple
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
doses within the hospital while they
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
detox the person I understand that
 
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.210 align:start position:0%
detox the person I understand that
um

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
but there should be in my opinion some
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
record keeping I would hope you would
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
take that back
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
um when these the follow-up question
 
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.770 align:start position:0%
um when these the follow-up question
manager

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes as long as it's pertaining to the
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
money aspects of this bill which is our
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
Focus thank you
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
when the money that you've gotten from
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
these companies that were fulfilling a
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
um well so we mean when that money stops
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
coming in right
 
00:52:00.359 --> 00:52:01.790 align:start position:0%
coming in right
um

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's going to be 17 years from now
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
um when all that money stops so I don't
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
know where we are I we have no idea what
 
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:14.579 align:start position:0%
the status of this opioid crisis will be
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
in 17 years
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
um I think those are very good questions
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
um you know there has been a lot of
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
federal money that has come in
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
for opioid use disorder work so much of
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
the money that goes into the doorways
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
has come from federal opioid grants and
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
there is a question about what happens
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
when that money stops and there's
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
indication that it's going to be at
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
least reduced so I think those are hard
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions that will need to be addressed
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's I I anticipate that they are
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
going to come to the commission and say
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
can you help make up some of this
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
shortfall uh because I think I don't
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
know offhand but I think just to to keep
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
these doorways programs open it's
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
probably 50 or 60 million dollars a year
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is coming from I guess a
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
Federal grant that won't go on forever
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I think we're going to have to
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
figure it out but again we don't it's
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
hard to anticipate where this where this
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
crisis is going to go and what our needs
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be 5 10 20 years from now
 
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:28.549 align:start position:0%
are going to be 5 10 20 years from now
okay

00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative almond did you have
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes you did we were waiting
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well I uh just trying to clarify on
 
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.990 align:start position:0%
yeah well I uh just trying to clarify on
representative

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting names again pillows
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh uh question on is the the position
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
that is already hired now in the budget
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
the new budget
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
because these things don't appear in
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
statute they appear in the budget right
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that I I know
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
that the position I know the position
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
was created by HHS I know that the
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
funding for it would come out of this
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
opioid uh I I don't I don't know the
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
answer to that and presumably what's
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
paid for was uh
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to by governor and council at
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
some point yes thank you
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience other
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions on this side of the room
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have any other pink cards
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
anyone else here would like to speak on
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 32 seeing none we will close
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay folks
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
um we will now break for caucuses and
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
come back around 11 to uh exact four
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
bills that are due representative all me
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
I may have missed this I'm I'm uh sorry
 
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of uh construction
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
going on on 89 now and I've got some
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
other problems but uh I've got Senate
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 113 in front of me we we also did
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
and we've inquired of Karen and she said
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake so ignore that
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
so what we have uh we have four bills
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
that we'll attempt to exec today and we
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
really need to get them done today
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
because we're up against deadlines so uh
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can do them efficiently but
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
we might need to give it a few hours if
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's other amendments that need to be
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
made so let's plan to meet back here at
 
00:55:45.839 --> 00:55:46.970 align:start position:0%
made so let's plan to meet back here at

representative elberger seconds
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury would you like
 
01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:32.219 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so our focus is principally on
 
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:37.460 align:start position:0%
the 5 million dollar
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
item and I was glad that I was able to
 
01:43:44.169 --> 01:43:44.179 align:start position:0%
have a colloquy with Senator Rosenwald
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
and would like to make sure that
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
our committee report provides the
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
necessary legislative intent
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
to ensure that this is understood to say
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
the department must have at least one
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
rfg round
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
whenever the fund is over 5 million
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
but that does not preclude them
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
from providing grants when the fund is
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
under 5 million and it does not mean
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
that they have to spend at least 5
 
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.590 align:start position:0%
that they have to spend at least 5
million

01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
so with a consent and understanding of
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to make that
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
explicit in the committee report
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Mommy
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it should also put the
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
the maximum maximum idea in there that
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
on the fund is being created by a
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
mixture of long-term of of one time and
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh serial on
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
on contributions
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
on from the settlements and can be
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
used in larger amounts in some years
 
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
agreed and I'll make that clear too
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%

language that are not highlighted that
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
would leave somebody to believe that
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%

01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
and that's not in current statute
 
01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.090 align:start position:0%
and that's not in current statute
also

01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
it conflicts with
 
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
it conflicts with
HP

01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
HP
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
655 which is the a Big Bill it's like oh
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know like eight pages or so that
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
reorganizes oplc and that has passed the
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and it's on the way
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
to the governor's office and this
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
um says that the fund shall be separate
 
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:55.100 align:start position:0%
and dedicated non-lapsing continuing
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated to the office
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of paying all costs and
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
salaries associated with the office
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
it does not say anything about
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
restricting it specifically to Capital
 
01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.129 align:start position:0%
restricting it specifically to Capital
expenditures

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:15.470 align:start position:0%
expenditures
and

01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.109 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
the third thing is that we heard that
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the commissioner um the
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc was
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
interested in purchasing a building and
 
01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:35.060 align:start position:0%
existing statute makes it very specific
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
that is the responsibility of admin
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
Services their division of purpose of
 
01:50:43.689 --> 01:50:43.699 align:start position:0%
purchasing properties
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
to make purchases of buildings and also
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
to execute long-term leases of which
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
oplc currently has
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
leased facilities with seven more years
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
left on that lease
 
01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.649 align:start position:0%
left on that lease
um

01:50:59.649 --> 01:50:59.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
and so the process would normally be for
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
any agency that wanted to have a new
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
facility or a new lease they would go
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
through purchase and property to
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
identify what you know if it was needed
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
what facilities might currently be
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
available to them and then it would go
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
through the budget process and the
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
entire budget process it would be put in
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
the budget going to the governor and
 
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
work its way through the house and the
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
Senate so this language which I think in
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
terms of restricting it to
 
01:51:36.239 --> 01:51:38.649 align:start position:0%
terms of restricting it to
capital

01:51:38.649 --> 01:51:38.659 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
appears to give them the authority to
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
make Capital purchases which
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
current statute just does not allow so
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're just some issues with this I do
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's why I had an amendment
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
which dealt with the 3 million you know
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
put the 3 million cap in there but
 
01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
put the 3 million cap in there but
um

01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
which I think everybody's on board with
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
but maybe not and just address those
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
technical issues thank you
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and just so you
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
know uh representative fellows did some
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
research on what administrative services
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
does and has some handouts for you if
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
you're interested
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on Senate Bill
 
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.970 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on Senate Bill
49

01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
49
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerical oh I apologize
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:28.490 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
yes

01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.290 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
there is that section that the Senate
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
put into law and the drafting did not
 
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.189 align:start position:0%
put into law and the drafting did not
uh

01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
did not indicate that that section was
 
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
actually new
 
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
so that everybody's been under a false
 
01:52:50.169 --> 01:52:50.179 align:start position:0%
impression of what the law was
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
originally that I find on
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
very irritating frankly and and think
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we probably
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
ought to do something about that
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.189 align:start position:0%
ought to do something about that
um

01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:07.199 --> 01:53:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.290 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just looking at this now and
 
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just looking at this now and
realizing

01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
realizing
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't
 
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.129 align:start position:0%
that I don't
see

01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:53:28.330 --> 01:53:28.340 align:start position:0%
in the bill that we're talking about
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
the cap of three million dollars
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
or any cap
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.810 --> 01:53:40.820 align:start position:0%
any apps Jay
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
it does seem like my version is wrong
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
here because I know I've read that
 
01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.830 align:start position:0%
here because I know I've read that
elsewhere

01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
no that's a report oh yeah here it is
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah all right okay I don't know where
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
this version came from
 
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's from a senate amended by the Senate
 
01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
it's from a senate amended by the Senate
but

01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay other content comments
 
01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.169 align:start position:0%
okay other content comments
um

01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
I do wonder if there's anything that we
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
to indicate that the law is being
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
changed here
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
on those section that section that
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has pointed out
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
without changing the rest
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
Jennifer hi
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
a quick question for our researcher uh
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
there are some language that wasn't
 
01:54:55.139 --> 01:54:57.050 align:start position:0%
there are some language that wasn't
highlighted

01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
01:54:59.689 --> 01:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
when we received it from OLS
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
is there a way to get that done now uh
 
01:55:03.239 --> 01:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
is there a way to get that done now uh
or

01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
and apparently this language was not
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
highlighted inside the Senate either
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
the drafter just didn't do it I did
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
contact the um the drafter and she
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was an error when
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
they were working on this bill
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that error is not present in the
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
house bill version
 
01:55:29.410 --> 01:55:29.420 align:start position:0%
um but it is present in this version
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
she did suggest an amendment to correct
 
01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.729 align:start position:0%
she did suggest an amendment to correct
that

01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
could we do that
 
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
01:55:45.970 --> 01:55:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and just just so you know
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and I spoke last
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
week about this and I thought there was
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
going to be a separate bill that did
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen so we could do if
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's a technical fix like that the one
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
that got rid of the capital yeah okay so
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
we could do if that's something simple
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's not just like a major policy change
 
01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
right it's just a
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
correcting of what's bold is that yes
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
she she characterized it as like a
 
01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
copying and pasting error like the
 
01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:16.139 align:start position:0%
formatting didn't enter into the program
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
as she expected it would when she went
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
back and reviewed it again
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
um when I asked the question so it's not
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
anything substantive it's just
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
an unexpected word processing
 
01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
error representative Oliver a question
 
01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
do scrivener's errors require such as
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
this require an amendment or can that be
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
just be considered a scrivener's error
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and be corrected by a uh
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
two-person uh I could follow up to ask
 
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
specifically whether this is something
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
they could correct and enroll to bills
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
when I asked her about the problem she
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
suggested an amendment
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
rather than suggesting that enrolled
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
bills would be able to take care of it
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
so it's I'm not 100 certain but I could
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
follow up on that would you please I'm
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
sorry to put you on the spot thank you
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
awesome okay so we'll ask her to do that
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
research and let the committee know and
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
if we feel if if it turns out that we
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
need to do a floor Amendment
 
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
we can certainly do that
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay any other hands up to make comments
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
on senable 49
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none the clerk will call the
 
01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
room and the motion before us is ought
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
what would we do if she says we need an
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
amendment then one of us will have to do
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment but no later it has to
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
be done until the clerk no later than 4
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
pm the prior day to session
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
there's no session this week so it'd be
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
for next week so we have a little bit of
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%

consent calendar I'm not sure if
 
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's right we don't want it on a
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so we'll put it on the
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
exactly right so we'll put it on the
 
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:16.580 align:start position:0%
regular calendar
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we will close the executive session
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%

session
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 112 and the chair
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative ulery for a
 
01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.850 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative ulery for a
motion

02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
I moved to retain
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
by representative elberger
 
02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.129 align:start position:0%
by representative elberger
representative

02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
ullery would you like to speak to your
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
motion uh there are questions and there
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
are questions
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
therefore

02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
I question whether or not we should pass
 
02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:27.229 align:start position:0%
I question whether or not we should pass
it

02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.410 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
representative

02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:32.219 --> 02:00:32.930 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
I think that most of the people on the
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee would like to use this
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to figure out what
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
problem gaming uh
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
treatment is doing in this state and if
 
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's any way we can make it work
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
better on and we
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
we also have a bit of a mess with how
 
02:01:00.250 --> 02:01:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Platinum we have a
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
version to online gaming this is online
 
02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:07.089 align:start position:0%
version to online gaming this is online
gaming

02:01:07.089 --> 02:01:07.099 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is a different bill this is
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
um more the breakage issue remember we
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
went through all the math equations and
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
so forth okay other comments on Senate
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill 112. so
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellow so just to
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
identify some more of the questions
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we know is that for
 
02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
paramutual racing that not all the race
 
02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:35.780 align:start position:0%
tracks are using the same breakage
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
and the other concern is like I I don't
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
know about anybody else but I had no
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
idea how they're dealing with breakage
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
on the historical horse racing machines
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
which is so we definitely need to
 
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
understand what what's going on with
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
that breakage how that works
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
just to emphasize uh representative
 
02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
Almond's note about problem gambling ice
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
or gaming you know I see these words
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably I sometimes wonder
 
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
about them gaming and gambling
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
I see this as one more opportunity
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
there's also a study commission to
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
look closely at to surface the issue of
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
problem gambling and to see what we're
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
doing about it already and what we ought
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
to be doing about it and how it's
 
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
affected by
 
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
the expansion of legal
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
gaming into what we now recognize our
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
casinos in New Hampshire so I look
 
02:02:51.790 --> 02:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
working with this bill as a retained
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
Bill and anything else that's there that
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
can be part of this
 
02:02:59.119 --> 02:03:00.910 align:start position:0%
can be part of this
to

02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
see if we ought to be doing a better job
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
on addressing the the downside of
 
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you represent only did you have
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
another comment oh sorry I should
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
mention that I am involved in the
 
02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming industry I didn't
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
think about that with this bill because
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
I don't think it directly impacts me but
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%

02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay we will now open up the executive
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 190 in the chair
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Doucet
 
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.370 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Doucet
promotion

02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
hey Madam chair I move we retain SB 190
 
02:04:56.089 --> 02:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
FN is there a second
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Orr's seconds
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
02:05:04.609 --> 02:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh as with the previous
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
Bill we just retained there's many
 
02:05:09.070 --> 02:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
questions that remain unanswered here
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
any expansion of gaming in the state
 
02:05:16.450 --> 02:05:16.460 align:start position:0%
needs its due hearing and do diligence
 
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I think we have the time and the
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
availability to take care of that and we
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't rush into judgment on this
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
um yes I I agree with the idea to retain
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
it some of my concerns are
 
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
how is this even any different than
 
02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
sports betting
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
and why isn't it under you know under
 
02:05:42.599 --> 02:05:43.850 align:start position:0%
and why isn't it under you know under
that

02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:44.930 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
02:05:47.099 --> 02:05:48.709 align:start position:0%
we know that
Seabrook

02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
Seabrook
 
02:05:52.250 --> 02:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
already has the what do you call it
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
Advanced Deposit they it's at the brook
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
they actually are holding money on
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
deposit for the races and their rate is
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
1.2 percent not the what's proposed in
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
here and I think that my biggest concern
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
is that when you have to if you move
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
this to essentially be you know online
 
02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:15.649 align:start position:0%
this to essentially be you know online
that

02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
you we probably are getting less Revenue
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
than we would get if it's done in person
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
because people that are in the casinos
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
not only are they they betting money but
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're also buying liquor and they're
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
buying food and and the state is getting
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
revenue for that so this is really a
 
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
tiny slice of money that we would be
 
02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
getting and it just said the whole
 
02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:38.689 align:start position:0%
getting and it just said the whole
concept

02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for me
 
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments from the
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee representative orrs did you
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to say anything just checking oh
 
02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry on this side any comments okay
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'll say it again I'm part of the
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming industry I don't think
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
this impacts me but just for the record
 
02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh what are the odds of it affected
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the motion before us is on retain the
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
retain this in committee and close the
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate bill 190.
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
I believe when you're done
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
so great job everyone uh very efficient
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's all we have left to do
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
on our committee at the moment
 
02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
um unless we must produce Revenue
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
updates or something like that I'll keep
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
you posted if that comes up
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
the speaker has said that there will be
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
no meetings in July or August
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
so we gotta plan on June though there's
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
a lot going on in June so be here
 
02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:26.870 align:start position:0%
a lot going on in June so be here
um but

02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
um we will meet in September and we'll
 
02:08:29.159 --> 02:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
um we will meet in September and we'll
probably

02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
start with just like a work session to
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
talk about all of the retained bills
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
I've lost count now but it's over a
 
02:08:37.199 --> 02:08:37.970 align:start position:0%
I've lost count now but it's over a
dozen

02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
so we'll go through that list and see
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
where we are and then maybe schedule
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
further work sessions with experts to
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
educate us further
 
02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
and we also talked about September maybe
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
doing a little welcome back
