00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
uh start uh the committee meeting here
 
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
we have a number of meetings which are
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
please over there the the great
 
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
discussions got to stop
 
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
we got to get going here
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the reason why well it's right at
 
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock when our hearings start but
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
I do have some announcements which have
 
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
to be made here one of which I'm getting
 
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
committee reports
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
that are coming in in the name of
 
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
somebody that did not make the motion
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's going to stop
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
so if if if somebody made a motion and
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's where we go then anybody's
 
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to work with that individual but
 
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
the report Still Remains in the name of
 
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
the person that makes the motion you
 
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
can't substitute something like that in
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
a committee report that's been
 
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
identified by our uh support Personnel
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the minutes of the
 
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
report that comes from representative
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli here and then checking out the
 
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
blurb and they don't match up so it's
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay to have support for example if
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli makes a motion ought
 
00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
to pass and he doesn't want to write
 
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
that blurb he could ask you know
 
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 align:start position:0%
represent luno to write that report
 
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
however it still comes in underneath
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's name in the
 
00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.170 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's name in the
blur

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
blur
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
well no no no I'm told but at that point
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
in time by the the ranking person here
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
who's going who's going to the report's
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
going to be written that's I have no
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
problems with that nor does anybody
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
upstairs but we're seeing the some of
 
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 align:start position:0%
the majority reports coming in very very
 
00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
different than what we have on the floor
 
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
so Rick while we're talking about
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
reports because we've obviously all been
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
been through some of these
 
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
um the uh and I know there's a um
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's a standard template for
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
that now yes the template I think has
 
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 align:start position:0%
some confusion when it comes to 1010
 
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
without recommendation yeah absolutely
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
definitely we're working on that yeah
 
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and um and so the reports that we
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
that my reports this interview I think
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
were pretty clear I didn't use the
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
template but uh but they were they were
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
10 10 no recommendations and and rather
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
than using terms like majority or
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
Minority Report in the 1010 it's a
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
report in support of ought to pass or in
 
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
support of itl it's not majority I'm
 
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
sure that's going to be brought up in
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
the ranking leadership meeting that they
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
have today at nine o'clock and in uh my
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
leadership is going to be at 9 15. that
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
is on the docket because that is I've
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
been using the template but I've been
 
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 align:start position:0%
putting on the top of a 1010 yeah and
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
then modifying the templates but it'd be
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
nice if it's just a box which you can do
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
right thanks Rick the uh the other point
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
that I want to make is that
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I need to have all the committee
 
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
I need to have all the committee reports
 
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.189 align:start position:0%
I need to have all the committee reports
for

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
February 1 February 3 and February 6.
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
hand it to me by the close to shop today
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
by the close of school today you have to
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
get those things into me
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh it's simply because that by the Bell
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't come in by the by the Bell
 
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't come in by the by the Bell
time

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
I will write the report or there will be
 
00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 align:start position:0%
no report of the position
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
uh so it's absolutely imperative that we
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
are really getting slammed with
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
committees that have uh a lot of reports
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
coming in now the sessions are now going
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
to come in very loaded and our
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
administrative support staff is
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
basically on tilt right now and we want
 
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
to really support them also if you're
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
doing a report
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
please do it either on that template or
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Word
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
so that the document can be transmitted
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
to those Folks up the hallway here and
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
they don't have to input everything over
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
it again I'm having to do that at night
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
myself on some of these reports and and
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
inputting my itself and it keeps me up
 
00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
to 11 30 12 o'clock every one of these
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
nights that's stopping if if it comes in
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I can't can't uh transmit it the way
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get transmitted
 
00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.450 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get transmitted
yes

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying on that template I said
 
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's the template that's the template
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice if you leave it on the
 
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 align:start position:0%
template because when you come
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
you you just save it as on your computer
 
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
just send it off to to myself with an
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
attachment and that's it so you never
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
have to mess your template up in case
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
you want to use it again
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
so you have your template on your
 
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.210 align:start position:0%
so you have your template on your
computer

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.850 align:start position:0%
computer
you

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
okay we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
work on that for you
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
so I want to go through some of the
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
reports that let's just go back and
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%

492
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%

we have one two three four five areas
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
where we have to do some work on
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
so that's it we need to get going with
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
our hearing I got to be out of here at 9
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
15. I see that reps and Miles already
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
of what you just went over because I was
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
272 that's increasing public school
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
funding per pupil
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh for 492 that's the one that we
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
already have all the material that's
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
your bill represent Tanner that's going
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
to be held that's the statute books you
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
know that we've asked for
 
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.870 align:start position:0%
know that we've asked for
um

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
529 that's a fiscal capacity disparity
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
Aid if in fact we we have a small get
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
together at noon time today the four of
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
us and and uh we'll work on that we'll
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
see whether that goes 213 or 215.
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and then we have
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
on 210 we will be doing the 577 that's
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
the state aid for special education
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
that's this week that's that but also on
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
213 we're going to be going to the
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
charter school report HB 71 remember
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
that was the report where they have to
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
report uh is it quarterly or three times
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
a year charter schools and we have that
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
question there
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to hassle that out and
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
get that one done but there's others of
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
course which will be coming up uh so
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that concludes that and what I'd like to
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
do now is get into the hearing today
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
satisfying curriculum requirements do we
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.210 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
you're no stronger is the sponsor here
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
is the co-sponsor here
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
we still have to okay we'll have to
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
dispose of it because it is a bill
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
regardless do you want me to just
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
introduce it Tom
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
yes but would you introduce that bill
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll close it down
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%

we have later on today which is very
 
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.629 align:start position:0%
we have later on today which is very
similar

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:46.509 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chair
 
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.449 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chair
um

00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:52.019 align:start position:0%
my name is Claudine Burnham
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
representative from Stratford County
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
District 2.
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I I support this bill I think that um
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
gives opportunity to
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
students who may be involved in
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
missionary work or Ministries that May
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
coincide within time frame of school
 
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.829 align:start position:0%
coincide within time frame of school
so

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to speak on that behalf
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great idea to give that
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the students that for
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
programs that are not available within
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
give um just so we get a better idea and
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
an example a specific example of where
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
well I was involved with youth groups in
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
my church for many many years and it
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
limits to students being able to support
 
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.610 align:start position:0%
limits to students being able to support
local

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.870 align:start position:0%
local
um

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
soup kitchens or
 
00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:57.470 align:start position:0%
soup kitchens or
um

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
working within the community within
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
those time frames that are available
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
so it limits students to maybe weekends
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
or evenings which is difficult as well
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
because many resources and Ministries
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
aren't available at that time and also
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes there could be
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
a Bible study or something that children
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
can attend and not be available to do
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
that during school hours such as
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
students who are homeschooled or another
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
School charter schools are maybe a
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
little more flexible to do that so this
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
just gives that availability to the
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
public school students as well thank you
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much you're
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you representative Belcher
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
inquire because I I know some schools
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
have different policies regarding
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
relative courses and uh whatnot
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
um do you know if president law would
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
actually prohibit
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
schools from giving uh credit for uh for
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
any sort of outside religious
 
00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:57.949 align:start position:0%
any sort of outside religious
instruction

00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know of the law that would
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit that
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know of any law that
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
accepts it either so okay thank you
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.250 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:12.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
so the what you're asking for is not a
 
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.630 align:start position:0%
so the what you're asking for is not a
course

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
that talks about religion and Compares
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
religions you're talking about basic
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
instruction Catechism classes that train
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
people to be
 
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.409 align:start position:0%
people to be
um

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
their particular religion whether it's
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
Seventh-day Adventist or whatever so
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak on our behalf on all
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
religions but
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
um if there are courses sometimes
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
there's online courses that are just
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
strictly during
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
school hours that may not be available
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
to the students that are in public
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
school so it allows them to have that
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
time set aside to take those classes
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
regardless of which religion it is
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes I think maybe you
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
misunderstood my question my question
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
was is this just a general core course
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
on world religions uh that you're
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
talking about or comparative course
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
versus religious instruction where the
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
instruction is specific to a religion
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
like Seventh-day Adventist or Buddhist
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
um that the the student takes that
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually trains them in that the
 
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:37.940 align:start position:0%
catechism the ideology of that religion
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
which are you talking about
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
one or the other or
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think this bill kind of keeps it
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
General it's not real specific as far as
 
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.470 align:start position:0%
General it's not real specific as far as
which

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
course or religion or practice I think
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's just open to
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
um for the faith-based program or
 
00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:07.490 align:start position:0%
um for the faith-based program or
instruction

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions uh yes
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually have two
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
um so one is it sounds like
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
some of this would be students leaving
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
their school campus to
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
do something affiliated with their
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
religion off the premises
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
so what are they missing when they leave
 
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
school it seems to me the school day is
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
already rather full
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then I do have another question if I
 
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.710 align:start position:0%
and then I do have another question if I
may

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you mean what are they
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
missing I mean I don't every student has
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
their own schedule within school
 
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.210 align:start position:0%
their own schedule within school
um

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
let me think how to put this differently
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
you can't really do two things at once
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
so if you're at the soup kitchen you're
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
not in something at school right how do
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
compensate for missing the class that
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
they're yes
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
um that would be something I think on a
 
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:10.340 align:start position:0%
based uh individual base
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
basis as to what they would have to make
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
I don't see that I I don't really know
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the sponsors purpose but I did
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
support this because I know of students
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
that have wanted to be involved in
 
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:28.820 align:start position:0%
certain instruction it may not be
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
ongoing it may be
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
it may be just a sporadic thing it might
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
be something based on requirements for
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
their faith to receive certain
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
sacraments and it's difficult for them
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
to do that during school time hours
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding I don't know the
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
specifics of
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
um people's schedules that's certain
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
certainly something that would be
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
brought to the school board to make that
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
decision as to how they would have to
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
make up for even in their teachers
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
so sorry I can't be a little more
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
specific but every student's different
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
and and their faith may be different so
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to one religion did
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
you have follow-up
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
um it's a different question and I
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually think probably it's for the
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor I'm wondering where the language
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
sort of preamble to the actual bill
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
but I felt compelled to speak regardless
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
because I do think it's it's good for
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
the students representative Allison oh
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
my question and this may be another one
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
of those questions that should go to the
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh but it it in lines 25 and 26.
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
and on that I'm sorry 22 and 23 24 of
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
the of the actual bill it talks about an
 
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.029 align:start position:0%
the of the actual bill it talks about an
intellectual

00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
intellectual
 
00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
intellectual
click

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
click
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
that is imposing Upon Our Nation modest
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
fads and fallacies do you have any idea
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
what the fads and fallacies are that are
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill I do not thank
 
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill I do not thank
you

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
Damon yes
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
just one more I was
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
wanting to clarify in line 17 and 18 in
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 on the first page it
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
reads the United States Constitution the
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
state law allows local school districts
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
to offer religious release time
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
education for the benefit of public
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
school students
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
interpret that to say we already have
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
this somewhere it doesn't specify
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
what RSA or where they're getting that
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
from but if that's so it seems like it
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's just to help educate the
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
school board to know that it's there I
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
I I have found that many of our local
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
school board members don't understand
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
some of the Privileges that are offered
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the questions see none thank you
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for being here
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
this is not the bill
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
no you should just representative
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning members
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
of the community bear Christina from the
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire School Board Association
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
um were opposed to the bill and not
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
because of the content by any means um
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
actually I think it's a very well
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
crafted bill in that it's permissive
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and then you know it puts a lot of
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
the burden um on the parents if they
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to enact this without putting the
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
burden on the school district to help
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
the student fulfill that our objection
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
um you know opposition relates to your
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
question representative Belcher about is
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
there anything already in law that would
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
allow school to search to do this uh we
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
would say yes our high schools have very
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh vigorous Extended Learning
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity programs where a student can
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
work with sort of a third party either a
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
company or an individual there's no
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
reason it couldn't be a church or or
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
religious organization where the student
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
can sort of do that work outside of the
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote traditional class time I
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
hope that's not me
 
00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.529 align:start position:0%
hope that's not me
good

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
um where the student you know can can do
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
some work outside of um outside of the
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh uh the uh the traditional classroom
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes during school hours sometimes
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
not during school hours so there's no
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
reason that a program like this couldn't
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
be turned into an Extended Learning
 
00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:40.370 align:start position:0%
be turned into an Extended Learning
opportunity

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
um we have the learn everywhere program
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
um that was initiated by the State Board
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
of Education two or three years ago at
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
this point I suppose
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in the law that would
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit a religious entity or religious
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
organization from being alone everywhere
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
entity where the student could then get
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
some level of credit for participation
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
with that organization or that course or
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
that group or or whatever it might be
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I guess another uh objection nhsba
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
would have is why just the religious
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
instruction then why are we doing just a
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
single carve out for religious
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
instruction instead of if a kid wanted
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
to join any other group or a sports team
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
or a band or a community theater or
 
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:24.500 align:start position:0%
anything anything else along those lines
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
and last is one of nhsba's frustrations
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
with some of these bills we keep talking
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
about Credit Credit Credit Credit
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
yes school districts are still offering
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
credit but with the significant changes
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
that are coming through the Department
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
of Education and the State Board of
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
Education relative to the review of the
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public education
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
department of education rule 306 where
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
we're shifting more back towards
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
competency language and putting a lot of
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
Competency language in those particular
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
bills credit is becoming
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say passe but um more
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and more we're using competencies and
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
meeting competencies in order to earn
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
credit so again those are our basic
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
oppositions we think that school
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
districts and and and students could
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
already engage in something like this
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
through existing programs whether or not
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
that was Extended Learning opportunities
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
or learn everywhere programs or School
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
District might just be able to say sure
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
you need to leave it at two o'clock on
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
Fridays to go to a Bible study course
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can accommodate that and
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know put some sort of academic um uh
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
parameters around it so the child could
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
earn credit and meet certain
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
competencies so those are nhsba's um
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill I'm happy to
 
00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:41.539 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that was very good
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
information thank you um and you were
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
able to answer my question which is a
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
very important question that there's
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
nothing currently prohibiting it there
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
is a necessary follow-up to that
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
question which is
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
is there anything that would allow as a
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
current law schools to prohibit a
 
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:06.380 align:start position:0%
student from
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
utilizing the faith-based outside
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
education for as described in the bill a
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
um extra career I'm not extracurricular
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
but um non-essential credit sure thank
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear is there anything
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
in law that would prohibit a student
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
from engaging in something like this is
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
that no do I have a backwards sort of is
 
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:30.299 align:start position:0%
there anything that would allow for a
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
refusal on the part of a school of the
 
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
refusal on the part of a school of the
school

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
um so the Extended Learning
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
opportunities that high schools offer
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
there's usually some level of review by
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
either the high school principal or some
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
high schools will have a an Extended
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity coordinator
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly hope that the if it
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
were to be objected to by the school
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
district I would certainly hope that it
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
would not be based on their religious
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
grounds because I think they'll be
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
clearly discriminatory there may be
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
um a a disallowance based on
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
um more I'd say sort of academic
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
components if you will
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
um so with the Extended Learning
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity programs yes there's some
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
level of oversight and usually it has to
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
be initially authorized or agreed to by
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
somebody in the school district the
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor the El coordinator
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
the high school principal so that would
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
be the that would be the perhaps one
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
barrier thank you
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
chairman Cordell good afternoon good
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
morning good morning good to see you uh
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
the question uh follow-up uh
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
this bill as I read it doesn't uh
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
differentiate between grammar school
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
elementary school or high school right
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
um so I I didn't we're talking about
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
current times and release times which
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
which I find is a concerning but the
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
other the question I had for if you make
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
this applicable and intent to high
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
school with the local school board then
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
be responsible to approve it as an
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
elective course so it'd be allowable in
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
um if it was done through the ELO
 
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.909 align:start position:0%
um if it was done through the ELO
program

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes there's I'm reading the language
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's I'm on page two line eight and the
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
locals the local Board of Education the
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
local school board May Implement a
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
policy to allow that
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and then you know there's a handful
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
of criteria about written consent
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
um you know things are things of that
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
nature so I mean to that extent it would
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
be if the as I read this if the bill
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
were to pass the State Board of
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
Education would adopt rules the local
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
school board and its own decision could
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
then Implement those rules adopt a
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
policy to allow for this
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
um and there was there a second part to
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
your question represented
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I was telling the crap can I just follow
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
up yesterday
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
um bro I I disagree with yours I
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with your reading on line eight
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
because I I'm reading that as the school
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
board can uh approve the time release
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
and I'll see that as uh I don't mean to
 
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
disagree to be disagreeable uh but the
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
time release versus the credit part
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
um so that's just my thinking as I read
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
it yeah thank you for the question
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative I read it and the you
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
know maybe maybe we're actually have to
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
clarify with the speaker or this but I'm
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
not sorry the speaker the um the sponsor
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
of the bill or when we've got a similar
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
Bill coming back later this afternoon
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
okay I was reading this as meaning the
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
State Board would adopt rules but it was
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
still left to the and and each local
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Education May Implement a
 
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:39.860 align:start position:0%
policy for a student to attend release
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
for a student to attend release time
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
release but I'm looking at that as this
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
local school board would have their own
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
local decision of whether or not they
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
implemented those those doe rules all
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you that's my reading of it
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%

District 43 in Milford I'm here to speak
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
in a position of this bill is someone

in a position of this bill is someone
who

00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
growing up when I was a little girl I
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
went to a Catholic private school
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
I believe these kind of bills is not
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
helping the students I wish we can
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
utilize the time not to push our own
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
religion beliefs with students which
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
should be pushing for students to learn
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the same way that I learned even when I
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
went to a Catholic School by my time it
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
wasn't spent on learning religion it was
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
explained to learn how to cook
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
Hadid so
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
how to manage my money
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
us pushing religion
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
is not helping it the people to be
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
better humans
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
enough is enough I see this happening
 
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.450 align:start position:0%
enough is enough I see this happening
everywhere

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I see
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
members of
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the school committee's commission this
 
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.070 align:start position:0%
the school committee's commission this
agenda

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
we need to teach our kids to be a better
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
humans and be better from their soul for
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
we can't keep pushing religion
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
just because it's our beliefs
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
please book note on to this build and
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
the other one is coming later on today
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
we don't need this we don't need them
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
all religion if you want to put you on
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
religion during your own time by getting
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
credits for learning religion is that
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
not what the kids need for the better
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
future thank you
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just just wanted to
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
clarify so on page two line ten it talks
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
about parent or Guardian giving written
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
consent this appears to be something
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
that would be parent directed more so
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
than than directed by us or a school
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
board is so is that is that the uh
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
the opposition here is it to the school
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
board directing uh religious
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
experience for the children or parents
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
oh the parents want to
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
are students might as well teach them
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
how to be a better human or how to
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
handle the future for themselves like I
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
say how to cook
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
how to clean and maybe learn something
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
maybe a trade
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
so they can be a better humans and they
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
can have a better future that's what my
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
um representative cascaden
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
I guess I would want your opinion I mean
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
I went to Catholic school as well
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
in your opinion who's responsible to
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
teach children their faith a parent or a
 
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
teach children their faith a parent or a
school

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.869 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
um you keep using the phrase pushing
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
religion I'm just wondering how is
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
allowing students to have release time
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
for participating in religious
 
00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:48.379 align:start position:0%
instruction pushing religion
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
like I say at parents
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
wants to do their own religion thing
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but with this kind of
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.930 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but with this kind of
build

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
it's as stolen the school that has to
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
teach religion this is not what we need
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
we need kids to learn trades we need
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
kids to learn how to manage their future
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
how to be better for themselves
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
growing up like I say
 
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:24.980 align:start position:0%
me learning
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
how to cook how to manage my money
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
both of the things that brought me a
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
better future yes it's an immigrant it
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
was hard
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
as someone who didn't know the language
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
when I was 15 years old and learned in
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
English as a second language it wasn't
 
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.310 align:start position:0%
English as a second language it wasn't
easy

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
but trust me the things that I learned
 
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
growing up it helped me to be a better
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
very human and better person
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
testimony and we have one more person as
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
I guess that will end our
 
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.730 align:start position:0%
I guess that will end our
time

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%

film
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill removes a requirement in
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
public school education laws that people
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
attend the school in the district of
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
their residence
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
change of school or assignment are to be
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
granted without discrimination based on
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
the resident of the student I have three
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
children currently we are homeschooling
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
two of them I was formerly on the school
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
board in my town for three years that
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
ended in 2022 and now I here I am at the
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
state house but sometimes
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that we need to refocus
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
public education on the student centered
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
aspect and um I think that we should put
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
power back into the parents and the
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
students to do what's best for
 
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:45.140 align:start position:0%
individual students and not worry about
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
the systems in general so this is
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
essentially removes the language you can
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
see in the Bill of to attend the public
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
school of assignment to a public school
 
00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:58.700 align:start position:0%
so that would allow the parent to
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
request a change of school assignment
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
based on the child's individual needs
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
um there would be no additional tuition
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
charged to the parent or legal guardian
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
if they should request it it would be
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
um either a negotiation between the two
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
districts or um it's a little bit
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
there's some language in there that you
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
can read into but um I think that this
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
helps Public Schools this is not a
 
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.310 align:start position:0%
helps Public Schools this is not a
um

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a controversial bill as far
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
as um you know funding private schools
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
or home school and things like that it's
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
just essentially removing the language
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the public school that you were
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
assigned to to a public school in the
 
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.109 align:start position:0%
assigned to to a public school in the
state

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to uh obviously questions
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much uh
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and good
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
morning so my question is relating to
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
special education which there is a large
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
special needs population in my town in
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
the surrounding area and currently under
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
the existing laws the town of residency
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be liable to provide services or
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
payment for services and special
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
education how would this change that is
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
my question it doesn't change it so I
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
read it the same way that it says it be
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
it that the child attends the school
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
would be responsible like meaning that
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
the services will be provided there but
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is still the
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the sending School
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative Myler
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
the question that I have for you is that
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
many school districts have a certain set
 
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.390 align:start position:0%
many school districts have a certain set
number

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
of students that they
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
can accommodate in a particular School
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
let's say you know the the sampling
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
let's say fourth grade they only have
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
room for 30 kids let's say how would
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
that deal with an issue if you for
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
example wanted to have your child go to
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
that school but they have a limit
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
limited number of spaces available well
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think like in response to like a
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
budgeting aspect because that's that's
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
the opposition I hear is that they
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
budget for so many kids
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know a year in advance a year and
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
a half in advance I think that the
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
economies of scale plays a plays a role
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
in here so you have 18 kids in a
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
classroom say in a fourth grade and you
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
add in three more kids there's not going
 
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:19.820 align:start position:0%
to be that much more of a cost
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
resource-wise to educate those three
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
more children in one District or if you
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
lose a few through children leaving and
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
going to a different school so I think
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that the budgeting process allows you to
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
move money around to accommodate changes
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
within a district now so I think that
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
that would apply here there would be a
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
little bit of a you know
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
um a transition point I should say
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
um for every District they have to
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
balance their budget regardless as the
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
year progresses so I don't see it being
 
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning I um in
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
my review of this I need to be honest my
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
quick review of this
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I didn't see anything about
 
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.309 align:start position:0%
um I didn't see anything about
transportation

00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
is it in here did I miss it it's a
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
parent's responsibility okay so just
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
like if you were to choose like a
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
charter school now you'd be responsible
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
to I'm at the public school and can you
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
tell me where that is here from the bill
 
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:46.750 align:start position:0%
tell me where that is here from the bill
transportation

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and thank you uh earlier on it was it
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
was there's no additional cost to the
 
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.750 align:start position:0%
was there's no additional cost to the
student

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
in school districts
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
um could this is because the audit could
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
be out of District by looking at it
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
under the um in school districts for
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
instance would have a a significantly
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
higher uh student support from The Local
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
District in the local town uh say Talent
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
expense 35 40 000 a year on their
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
student and you're coming from town y
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
that spends twelve thousand dollars a
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
year so that receiving town you have to
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
make up the additional Gap
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
for your youngster
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
those local taxpayers for 30 40 000 per
 
00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:41.809 align:start position:0%
those local taxpayers for 30 40 000 per
diem

00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
diem
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
you're talking about for like a typical
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
child for the cost of
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
time if I wasn't
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
a school system that's only supporting
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
my youngsters say at twelve thousand
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in a town down the road
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
which I could transport them to on the
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
way to work spending forty thousand
 
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
um in the sort of tax period in that
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
town of forty thousand dollars who's
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
going to pick up the difference of
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand because there's no cost
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
so the way I read it is that there's a
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
negotiation process between like the
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the sending school to
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
the next one but there should be no cost
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
additionally to the parent or Guardian
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
um like I said economies of scale the
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
pupil cost per pupil cost at the
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
receiving school will change based on
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
new enrollment
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
well let me take it I'm in Conway and I
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
work in Northampton and I want to put my
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
youngster in Rye
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
and it's a 30 000 difference and the
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent Right Said No we're going
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
to take off an extra 30 000 expense
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
because you don't you know you don't
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
like your school uh for whatever reason
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
um where's that money get picked is it
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
the right taxpay have to pay for that so
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that receiving a child
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
then will cost that school thirty
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I think that's what the
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
per pupil cost is based on like again
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're funding the system not the
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
student like to add one more child into
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Rye I don't believe it's really going to
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
cost the taxpayers of Rye thirty
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I have a
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
question that's going to follow up
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
exactly on that track you're on I'm done
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
you're in uh captain and you want to
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
send your youngster to Waterville Valley
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
or a community which is a huge drop but
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
your child is also a catastrophic Aid
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
student where the costs are 250 000
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay that burden
 
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
the way I interpret this bill and maybe
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
someone else has a different opinion but
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's the the taxes you paid and
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're sending your current
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
District your is what's funding
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
the special ed program
 
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
I have more than one question I'll start
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
with on page three lines 27 to 30. where
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
it limits the number of reassignments or
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
transfers in any one school year
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
so what happens if more parents and
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
students apply what
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
they're just shut off or
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
what happens I believe this would allow
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
the school to give priority to students
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
who do reside in that District over kids
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
who want to
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
move their is that your question I'm
 
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
move their is that your question I'm
sorry

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
let me say back what I think I heard you
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
say to see if I have it right
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
you are is that okay Mr chair yes go
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
ahead so you're saying the residents in
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
a district would have priority for their
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
local school
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
and then if I'm reading this 27 to 30
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
lines correctly the incoming students
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
from anywhere else
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
are capped at this amount but my
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
if there's more incoming students what
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
is the criteria deciding who who can
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
come and who doesn't get to come
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think the bill
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
um specifies that I would assume I would
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
assume each district could set those
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
parameters if they wanted to do a
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
lottery or you know enrollment in
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
general in New Hampshire is is falling
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure there's a physical space
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
limitation in most of these schools if
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's where you're if that's what
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
you're referring to I guess you could do
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
a lottery system that sort of thing like
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools do I'm not sure if that
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
the bill specifies what a superintendent
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
can do to decide who gets in
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
in what order
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think it does represent Belcher
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.130 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
so first of all I think what this bill
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
is ultimately trying to do is is
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
introduce competition which is something
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
that I applaud I do have a couple
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
concerns and one of them and I'm hoping
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
you can speak to it that maybe help
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
alleviate the concern is that under this
 
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:51.740 align:start position:0%
bill we could conceivably see rapid
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
swings of relatively large numbers of
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
students between schools and how how
 
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
could that impact the ability to do
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
things like large-scale new construction
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
and other projects within different
 
00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:06.890 align:start position:0%
and other projects within different
areas

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
is there a three okay three lines 27
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay I would withdraw that because there
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
is a limitation on the bill but I if I
 
00:49:28.859 --> 00:49:30.170 align:start position:0%
is a limitation on the bill but I if I
may

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:30.890 align:start position:0%
may
um

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
in that case would it not I mean if
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
there is a limitation on this we're not
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
allowing every student to participate is
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
that not in itself
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
kind of another problem that I was
 
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.650 align:start position:0%
kind of another problem that I was
talking

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
what we saying rep oh
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're putting a limit on that to prevent
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
that the first question I asked about
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
the large swings apparently we're going
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
to prohibit that by eliminating the
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
number of students that are able to
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
transfer from any one School director
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
any one other school district to one
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
percent but is that is that not in
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
itself kind of an unfair way of of doing
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
it we're just kind of lottery for which
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
students are going to be able to go
 
00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:16.630 align:start position:0%
students are going to be able to go
foreign

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
that are going to change schools because
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
of this but there are a small percentage
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's one percent maybe it's less
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
that are not having their needs met at
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
their current District school if they're
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
assigned to by ZIP code I wanted to
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
reference one other thing if I may like
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
the correct the housing crisis that we
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire is limiting people
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
from keeping their children in the
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
district they're in so imagine if you
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
are having trouble finding housing uh in
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
your current district and you're basing
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
your child moving into another District
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
because you have to move to another
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
apartment for example this would save
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that student if the parent is willing to
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
drive them to the next town over uh if
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
they should find housing nearby that
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
would eliminate this as a school board
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
member formally we had children who
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
would petition to stay in the school
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
because their parents lost their housing
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
and we would have to make a case-by-case
 
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.190 align:start position:0%
and we would have to make a case-by-case
basis

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
um on whether we let children finish the
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
year because they were forced to move
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
out of the ZIP code that's an arbitrary
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
line that decides where this children
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
belongs so um I guess I just thought
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
about when I was when you were asking
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
but thank you
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
I I do have a follow-up question in mind
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
um about 10 years ago we had a bill that
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
dealt with students going from one
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
District to another and there had to be
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement between the receiving
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
district and the sending District
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
my concern is how does this bill prevent
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
a school that's the receiving School
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to selectively
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
admit to our school
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
the kids that are going to be able to
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
make our division one basketball team a
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
winner here in the state and by that the
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
and the parents going to say well that's
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to provide my child a better
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a division one
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
scholarship uh for post-secondary
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
Education later so how do we stop this
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
from you know developing these
 
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:11.900 align:start position:0%
athletic superpowers and it will occur
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill still maintains you need to
 
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:18.140 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
or any other hardship is determined by
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
the parent but it does not include
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
playing competitive Sports at the D1
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
student uh the other school down the
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
road that's how I interpret it
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you representative Hall
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:52:37.809 --> 00:52:37.819 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if you you could give
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
your two or three
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
um the best interests of the child give
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
examples of what that would be to go to
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
another school
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um child wants to do Robotics and their
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
their school uh their High School in
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
their District doesn't have a robotics
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
program but um I'm gonna say Pinkerton
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
because that's a school near me uh
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton does can their parents uh
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
choose Pinkerton and send their child
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
there for high school because they have
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
a love for robotics or curriculum
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
offerings that this school doesn't have
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
um we have a student who wants to learn
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
Mandarin Chinese and elementary school
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
because their family is
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
um a speaker of that language they don't
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
offer that at their elementary school
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
but they offer it in Portsmouth I'm not
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
sure I'm just you know
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I would say bullying also exists as a
 
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.430 align:start position:0%
um I would say bullying also exists as a
um

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
a hardship if they're having trouble
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
there or
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of reasons though so in
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
my district uh Fremont we have a tuition
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
program with a Regional High School and
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
so parents will come and say something
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
we'll petition for their own child to go
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
to a another school that's not on record
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
because of XYZ and it's some sort of
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
educational hardship I think that most
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
people are familiar with that
 
00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:56.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have another six cards on this bill
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have a question it might be
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
asked to somebody else that's you know
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
might be good represent
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
Allison I'll be talking about this and
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair thank you for taking
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
my question building on an example that
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Miler used early on we've
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
got a fourth grade classroom that has 30
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
kids in it and one teacher if in fact
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
the transfers coming in amount to like
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 students in the school district
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
has to hire a half-time fourth grade
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
teacher who pays the salary of that
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
additional half-time fourth grade
 
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.589 align:start position:0%
additional half-time fourth grade
teacher

00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
that that District does so just like
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
within the year uh within any school
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
year there's budgeting adjustments like
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
transfers uh based on enrollment you
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
don't know when you're budgeting out 18
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
months who's going to be there you take
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
a best guess maybe you put in some ghost
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
students into the budgeting process to
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
allow for that growth but you don't know
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
come September 1st who's moved out of
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
the town or who's moved in so would you
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
take from another grade that maybe had
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
some attrition who lost students who now
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
the second grade has 14 kids would you
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know now not have two second grade
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
classes maybe go down to one that's what
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
we do in my district is that we move
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
teachers around
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the current situation and
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the budgeting process
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you represent a noble
 
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:26.660 align:start position:0%
almost did you write your hand up
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question can we just talk
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
about the special ed just one more time
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
page four lines 13 through 15. if I went
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
the original wording it would say if a
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
child is enrolled out of District the
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
town that the child resides in would
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
retain all responsibility provision of
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
special ed services is that correct
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's the original morning okay may I
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
um so we you switched it to attends so
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
but maintained all the same
 
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.710 align:start position:0%
but maintained all the same
responsibilities

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that the attending
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
district has to pick up all the price
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I questioned this myself this morning
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
because I didn't like the wording I have
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
two special ed kids so I'm familiar um
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
so you're paying so much per pupil in
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
your current residing district and that
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
money would go to be a
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
attending I'm not I'm not sure if this
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
should be reworded or amended but I read
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
it that way too that it's the opposite
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's
 
00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:35.150 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's
um

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
possible okay in this school so um I do
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
think that wording's a little
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
maybe that's an error thank you thank
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Tanner and then we're
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to go on to the next card thank
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
you for letting me take the question
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
you for letting me take the question
um

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is this
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
bill based on an Alec open enrollment
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
national uh bill
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that I'm a
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um I agree with that I don't
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
know where it came from
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
if it was model legislation is what
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
model Edge from Alec from Malik I don't
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
know that question I'm sorry I'm the
 
00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
know that question I'm sorry I'm the
answer

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I'd like
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning I'm David
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
Trumbull I live in the town of where I'm
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill for three reasons
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
first I think it will do harm to the
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
property poor towns in the state because
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
under this bill if they lose five
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
percent of the students at a particular
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
school that will affect the amount of
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
money they get from the state as part of
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
the state aid meanwhile those five
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
percent of the students who go to
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
another school they're going to have to
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the receiving town the
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
amount of tuition so I live in where we
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
spend about sixteen thousand dollars per
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
student we border with Hopkinton we fact
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
share a robotics team with them I can
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
invest and envision
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
vast amounts of people in my town saying
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
I want to send my child over to
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton because they spent closer to
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
30 000 per student so somebody's going
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
to have to negotiate how much they get
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
if it costs where fifteen thousand more
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
per student and we lost money from the
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
state we now have less money but we
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
still have fixed costs we still have the
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
same classrooms the maintenance costs
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably the same number of teachers
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to hurt the property poor
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
town so a bill like this will widen the
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
gap between the property four towns and
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
the property Rich towns as far as their
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
ability to provide an education so I
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it will help second of all
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill lacks any criteria if the town
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
of where is only going to be allowed to
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
send so many to Hopkinton how do you
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
decide who it's going to be the chairman
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
was concerned that it might be for
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
athletic reasons I could see a property
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
Rich Town saying we'll only take the
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
children who have the highest gpas from
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
your school so now you've got this drain
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
of all of your top students from your
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
school now going over to the property
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
richtown school who already do much
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
better on the state a proficiency exams
 
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
that's going to hurt the property poor
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
town school because you need to have a
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
good balance of students in your schools
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
so without criteria this bill just
 
00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:21.380 align:start position:0%
really doesn't even have the the the
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
solidity to be legitimately considered
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
the third thing is what's the
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
alternative to this uh a representative
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
said something about this bill promotes
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
competition maybe competition between
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
public schools and private schools is a
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
good idea but competition between public
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
schools and different towns is not a
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
good idea the property poor towns can't
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
afford to provide an adequate education
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
you saw in the Concord Monitor that last
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
week the town of Allenstown the school
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
board there examined what they would
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
have to do if they could only get the
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
amount of money that was defined as
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
adequate under the state definition they
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
basically had to get rid of all
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
individual special ed Sports after
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
school activities plowing the driveway
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
fixing the roof they had to fire 85
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
percent of their people in town the
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
state isn't providing enough money so
 
01:00:10.329 --> 01:00:10.339 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be to adequate
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
fund every school in the state the
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
property poor towns and the property
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
Rich towns as was required by the
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the Claremont decision
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't have a need for this
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
sort of a bill or the very few cases you
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
would you could find some other
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
alternative like Charter Schools or
 
01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:26.339 align:start position:0%
things like that but there's no need for
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
this bill if we go back to the beginning
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
this legislatures have a duty sitting on
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
its desk for 30 years to adequately fund
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
education in the property poor towns and
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
every one of the bills that you're
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
considering and I've been watching from
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
home and I appreciate how hard you're
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
working most of them could be resolved
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
if you just solve that problem
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
originally you wouldn't need a bill like
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
this so those are my three reasons thank
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
you very much sir thank you very much
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome I'd like to
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
welcome Barrett good morning chairman
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
Ladd good morning again members of the
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
community bear Christina school boards
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
Association we are opposed to the bill
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the previous speaker summed it up um
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly from nhsba standpoint there
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
are a couple other
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
um sort of logistical aspects of the
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill that um I think they're probably
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
oversights but I think it's important to
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
um to draw attention to them
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
um on page two line 20 we talk about or
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
any other hardship as determined by the
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
parent and then also at the bottom of
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
that page it says the superintendent
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
shall have the burden of establishing
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
the absence of a manifest educational
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
hardship by clear and convincing
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
evidence but if we jump to page three
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
line five it says if the school board
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
finds that the parent or Guardian has
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
not met their burden so I don't know if
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
that was an oversight in drafting or or
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
whatever that that may have been
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
um the other challenge too with this
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's somebody over here
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned I forget who it was about sort
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
of Swing in student population in any
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
given year and how are School District's
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
going to be able to respond to that if
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
you don't know how many kids you're
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
losing in any given year and you know
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
how many kids that you're having coming
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
in every year I don't know how you're
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
able to properly budget your budget is
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
based on the number of students that you
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
have in the building your state aid is
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
based on the number of students that you
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
have in your ADM in your in your adma so
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
you know are there timelines from one
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
parent or students would have to like
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
apply to the other school what happens
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
if this is if you suddenly you lose or
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
gain 20 kids in the middle of a school
 
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:40.940 align:start position:0%
year I mean we can't find enough
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals and teachers today as
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
it is and also our school district
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
budgets are set 18 months before they're
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
actually becoming operational based on
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
Based on data that's like two years old
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I don't know how you can
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
properly budget or a school district
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
could properly prepare for anything like
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
this the other aspect
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna see where page four
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 15 where it's now
 
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:09.380 align:start position:0%
shifting special ed
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
costs to the where the the district
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
where the student attends that is a
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
seismic shift in special ed funding in
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I remember when this
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
provision came into law and I want to
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
say 2007 2008 maybe 2009 where there was
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
a a disagreement with um a local policy
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
actually over who was going to be
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
responsible for special education costs
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a student that did not attend in
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
District and I believe it went up the
 
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
federal court I think federal court
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
determined that it was going to be the
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
District of residence that was going to
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
provide the special education cost so
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be a seismic
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
shift as as well too
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
um the rest of the stuff about the
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
definition of residency I didn't really
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
I didn't really have any too too many
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
object objections with
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
um there is one curious provision though
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
on page six line five where it says um
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
actually that whole
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
preceding paragraph lines 31 through
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
about 36. no person shall be excluded in
 
01:04:17.099 --> 01:04:19.250 align:start position:0%
about 36. no person shall be excluded in
participation

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
um based on discrimination based on age
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
sex gender identity race color sexual
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
orientation so on and so forth and it
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
says or their residents within the
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
borders of the state so
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
what town you live in is now going to be
 
01:04:34.569 --> 01:04:34.579 align:start position:0%
a protected class under
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law that I don't
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that seems that seems peculiar that
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
we're creating another protected class
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
based on based on where somebody lives
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect too I won't I won't
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
get into this again a lot of this
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee has has
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
um we've lived through various
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
iterations of the Manifest educational
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
hardship statute over the last five or
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
six years now representative or chairman
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
lad you know nhsba was always happy to
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
help with that there have been some
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the manifested statute that
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
nhsba has opposed there were some
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
changes to the man educational statute
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
nhsba was happy to support and how happy
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
help craft I mean I'm not hearing those
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns about manifests
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
that are not coming across my desk our
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
staff attorney is not getting those
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
calls we've maintained that for a number
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
of years the manifested system will
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
perhaps not perfect by and large worked
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
well and continuing to change the
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
statute every single year is is
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
problematic for school districts and
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
really not in the best interest of
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
parents or kids either because when the
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
chain of law is changing every single
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
year you're not able to rely on what the
 
01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
system that preceded it may may allow or
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
encourage or or benefit students in so
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
those are nhsba's objections and I'm
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I have one
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
question for you if a student is
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
attending Rivendell
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
which is one of our intergovernmental
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
Interstate type districts and the
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
student from Warford wants to go to
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
Hanover recording this bill they could
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
do so but what about the other high
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
school students sitting right beside
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
this student in class comes from Corinth
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
or fairly that comes from I'm sorry the
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
last bit or fairly Vermont which is
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
right in our school district right yeah
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
I mean the the the the the inter state
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
districts are sort of their own animal
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
aren't they it's not really clear who
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
those students belong to are they
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont students are they New Hampshire
 
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.529 align:start position:0%
Vermont students are they New Hampshire
students

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
um that's certainly a question relative
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
to the bill I guess one of the other
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
aspects too we've talked about a
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
robotics team or a hockey team in
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
athletics there are a series of
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
decisions from the State Board of
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
Education going back 15 20 years where
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
the state board has determined that the
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
lack of an extracurricular activity is
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
not a manifest educational hardship it
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily it may it may you
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
know yeah the kid might like to be on
 
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
the hockey team or the robotics team or
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
whatever program you know that there is
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
but you know to some degree that's going
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
to get back to the previous speakers
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions about if you're at high school
 
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
can't offer a hockey team it's probably
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know one reason maybe because of
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
money it may be they can't afford it
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have enough kids to
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
field a team but we know that you know
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
we have sports teams now that comprise
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
of three or four different high schools
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's soccer whether or
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
not that's hockey whatever it might be
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
so public schools are already working to
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
integrate these sorts of programs and
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars in areas
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
um that that kids may not otherwise be
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
able to access them thank you further
 
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.390 align:start position:0%
able to access them thank you further
questions

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
I wanted to address your budgeting
 
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.250 align:start position:0%
I wanted to address your budgeting
issues

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.029 align:start position:0%
issues
um

01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is schools can't tell
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
how many kids are going to be there at
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
any point in time anyways because people
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
move in and out of the district and a
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
previous speaker had said they actually
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
budget for go students just in case they
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
get others would does this school boards
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
Association not have you have policies
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
for everything do United policies for
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
how to deal with fluctuating populations
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
based on all the things we see now kids
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
moving in and out all those kinds of
 
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:27.140 align:start position:0%
things let's take for the question
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative I mean we know we don't
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
have any specific policies on that there
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
are probably internal budgetary
 
01:08:34.199 --> 01:08:35.150 align:start position:0%
are probably internal budgetary
um

01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
um that's where I'm looking for
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
protocols that your ba uses in
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
conjunction with your superintendent and
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
your business manager and whatnot I mean
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
you have we have a former superintendent
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
on this committee we might be able to
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
ask her how she would budget for these
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
ghost students and and how to deal with
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the fluctuations in the student
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
population in any given year thank you
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you it's just a follow-up to that
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
and let's represent Cascade and let's go
 
01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:00.650 align:start position:0%
and let's represent Cascade and let's go
there

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
we have a budget process established by
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
Doe in which our budget is premised upon
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
the attendance in the prior year
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
so we do not budget for go students is
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you for the question
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
I mean well that there's funding and
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
budgeting yes the funding is based on
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
the number of kids that we've had based
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
on all the doe reports whether or not
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
you you know you I don't want to you
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
know and to some degree they're not so
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
much go students but you have to
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate you know historical Trends
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
say you know you know we may go up one
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
and a half percent of our student
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
population over the course of these 12
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
months the other aspect too and this
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
just popped into my mind I'm sorry I
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to take up any more time I know
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of bills today the other
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
question that this doesn't necessarily
 
01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:49.100 align:start position:0%
reflect is what happens if the receiving
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
School District ends up with a
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
significant budget surplus at the end of
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
the year where does that money does it
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
go back only to the taxpayers in that
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Community or does it go back to the
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are then sending their
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
kids in to that community
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't address that we have at
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
least with our tuition agreements where
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
a district maybe sends their high school
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
kids to it to a different town that can
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
at least be negotiated all right we want
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage back of your
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
unexpended fund balance every year to
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
come back into our community because
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're paying 25 000 ahead but you've got
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
a million dollars on reserve fund
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
balance next year maybe that you know in
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
part because we were paying tuition
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe our voters should get some
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
of that money back as well too so the
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
law doesn't address for the simple the
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
summary of this is that there are a lot
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
of budgeting and revenue problems if you
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
just open up sort of open enrollment
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
across across any New Hampshire school
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you not seeing any other hands
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Deborah
 
01:10:50.880 --> 01:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Deborah

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:15.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
good morning Jeremy Ladd and members of
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
the committee I am happy to be here
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
addressing you on House Bill 4041 this
 
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.669 align:start position:0%
addressing you on House Bill 4041 this
morning

01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
um Confederation of teachers New
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I want to express our
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
position to this bill we have 4 000
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
members across the state and I was doing
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
a little math yesterday our members are
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
mostly in K-12 education but also uh
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
public higher education and public
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
services and in one way or another we
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
work with about 29 000 students in
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
districts across the state so that's a
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
good chunk of the 165 000 students in
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
public education in New Hampshire and we
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
do oppose this bill
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
um as you know New Hampshire cherishes
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
public education so much so they put it
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution but it doesn't do a
 
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
good job funding it and previous
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
speakers have talked about that so I
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
won't go into too much detail
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
you know we have huge disparities in
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
what you can get for your public
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
just a few statistics here
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for a dollar spent on
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
public education 64 cents comes from
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
local property taxes 31 cents comes from
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
State funding and five cents
 
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
approximately comes from the federal
 
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
government that's from the national
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
Center for educational statistics
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and we are last in the country for
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
State funding of public education
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
so you can get
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
different level of opportunity in your
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
public education depending upon where
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
you are getting that public education
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
and that's what we need to fix not by
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
letting a few kids go here or there
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
depending upon whether their parents can
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
provide transportation whether they are
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
close to another District that provides
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
a lot more opportunity but by fixing the
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
funding formula so that every Public
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
School in New Hampshire can provide a
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
great education be wonderful if Mandarin
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
were an option in elementary school or
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
robotics were an option for all public
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
school students let's strive for the
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
goal of having
 
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.250 align:start position:0%
goal of having
quality

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:27.260 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
well-resourced public schools for all of
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
our students and really rather than
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
repeating what other people have said I
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
think I'll stop there I do have
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that will be coming to you by
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
email Microsoft is aside I need to
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
update all the drivers on all of my
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
technology this week so I apologize for
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
not having it to hand out to you but you
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
will be getting it as soon as I get back
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
to my seat and I'll answer questions if
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
I can thank you very much representative
 
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
I can thank you very much representative
Lexus

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that some
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
students some of the reasons they don't
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
want to go to their public school as it
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
stands now special needs students it's
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
because the school is too big and too
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
noisy and whatever and when they go to a
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
charter school it's because it's small
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they have problems with all of
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
that input and everything of the noise
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
and the other students would that not
 
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.669 align:start position:0%
and the other students would that not
also

01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
help them if the neighboring school
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
which you say you know maybe as small
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have much to offer but maybe
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
what they have to offer is the fact that
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're small and quiet and so that
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
special needs student might choose to go
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
to the smaller and potentially poorer
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
school just because it's smaller and
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
quieter and they wouldn't have to go to
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
find a small charter school they could
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
find that smaller public school right
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
next door
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
I hear you mixing several different
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
types of schools small Charter Schools
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
small next door school I'm not going to
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
try and parse through a bunch of
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals here I think I'll just
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
just leave that for your discussion with
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
the committee so but I appreciate the
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you very much
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh it's representative what oh I didn't
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
see that thank you thank you for taking
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
my question do you feel that um charter
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
schools actually offer the alternative
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
choice for parents in a in a public
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
school system uh that would that would
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
place the take the place of this
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
particular need to to be able to go to
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
um schools without outside of your
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
residence we do have that within our
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
state law framework already in our
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
framework of laws we have the existence
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
of charter schools so that is already an
 
01:15:58.679 --> 01:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
of charter schools so that is already an
option

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further questions thank
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%

in the committee next door at 9 30 also
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
um so the what I was really trying to
 
01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:01.790 align:start position:0%
um so the what I was really trying to
um

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
do with this bill is to not discuss
 
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
do with this bill is to not discuss
um

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.290 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.550 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
um outside uh other educational
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities or talk about the
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
budgeting process I'm talking I want
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
um the focus of our education to be on
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
the students and what's in the best
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
interest of the students
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the testimony that you hear
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
today is it would be really hard
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
it would be really hard for Budget it
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
would be really hard for planning but I
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't hear a lot of discussion about it
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
really is not was best for the student
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
like what we're deciding right now is
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
based on where you live and that is not
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily what is best for the student
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
to go to the school that is close to
 
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.350 align:start position:0%
to go to the school that is close to
them

01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
what what I'm trying to say is that
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
you should not when you're hearing
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier and and after me
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
are are the arguments because it is what
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the child or
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
is it because it's convenient and easy
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so I think that this bill is mainly
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.649 align:start position:0%
and so I think that this bill is mainly
um

01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
trying to adjust that
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
um focus of the state to say no we're
 
01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
not we're not in it for the institution
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
of of public schools
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
um we're in it for the children and
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
we're trying to provide an education and
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so we need to make an assessment and
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of a kid
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
and not just try and prop up this school
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
or that school they're all public
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
schools where we're talking about today
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
is all public schools and and does any
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the public schools in our state re
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
fit the needs of of the children and
 
01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.270 align:start position:0%
fit the needs of of the children and
um

01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
and if they do then why shouldn't that
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
child be able to attend that school
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
what why should the government come in
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
and say no that's not appropriate
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
because you don't live there and
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
especially when there's housing issues
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
and maybe you're not able to maybe you
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be want to move into that District
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
but because there's essentially no
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
housing you're not able to move at that
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
time and maybe you're going to plan to
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
move in the future when something
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
becomes available but right now you why
 
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
harmed or lack of a better word or not
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
not reaching their full potential
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
because they're not able to make that
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
move right now in this climate of not of
 
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh housing shortage right and so all of
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
these things come into Factor but the
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
real question is what is in the best
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
interest of these children is it is it
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
that school or this school and where is
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
the government
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
um proper role if it's just to say you
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to educate the kid and
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
trying to do what's best for the kid or
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
are we really trying to just prop up
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
this this specific system and obviously
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
we've already heard before that that
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
there already is complications as far as
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
budgeting it's not an easy process and
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes there there is funding from the
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
state that is based on the prior
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
attendance but the school district the
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
school budget is still
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
um based on uh their historical needs
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
and what they believe may be the case
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
and there is a provision in this that
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
um you can lit not have more than
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
um one percent uh changing changing uh
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
because of this and so you have some
 
01:21:07.209 --> 01:21:07.219 align:start position:0%
range to be able to
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
estimate what is going to be the change
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
in this next particular Year yes it's
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
not exactly but you don't have an exact
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
number now and so
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that there's any
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um reason that that should should be a
 
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.030 align:start position:0%
um reason that that should should be a
uh

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
a detriment to this this idea and
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
there there's a process for
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
being able you don't just because
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um you know you can have a policy that
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
says you're going to accept this many
 
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
students if if that's if you don't want
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh to the question before about oh what
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
if you are maxed out and you need and
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
you have another person come in well you
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
don't if you're already maxed out you
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
can have a policy that says you're not
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
going to accept more than this many
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
students because this is your maximum
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know capacity and so the when uh uh
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
a parent and an administrator is having
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
that conference they can come to the
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
realization that this this school is not
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
going to be able to meet the needs of
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
that student because they don't have the
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
capacity for another uh another student
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
um in the times of um of declining
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
enrollment and and less children that I
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
think a lot of uh schools would be happy
 
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be welcoming in additional students
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
um because what we're seeing mostly is
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
people uh is is declining enrollment and
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
so having a full school will make
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know a better productive use of
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers money so thank you for
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
for letting me testify thank you very
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
much I do have one question for you to
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's no special
 
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.709 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's no special
preparation

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
preparation
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment given to a
 
01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
particular student have you looked at
 
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
the charter school admission process
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm familiar
 
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
with it are you I did not consider
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
putting it in this this bill but I'm not
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to such a change if that you
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
think that that would be appropriate I
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
my goal of this bill is is to be focused
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
on what is in the best interest of the
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
children and not
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
um a specific
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um you know school district and so if
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
and so if the lottery is the correct way
 
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
if you have a you know a bunch of
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
students which would all be able to be
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
adequately served by the school and and
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
you chose it by Lottery I'm not opposed
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
to that I'm just I think that um that
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
the sentiment as far as like what we're
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
what our goal is and and trying to
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
educate and give these children the best
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
option I think that is
 
01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
is where my head is at for this thank
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
you Bill thank you there are questions
 
01:24:00.179 --> 01:24:01.910 align:start position:0%
you Bill thank you there are questions
representative

01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
my question absolutely
 
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
my question absolutely
um

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you for looking out for the
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
best interest of kids because I've spent
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
my 45-year career looking out in the
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
best interest of kids whether it's best
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
interest manifest hardship or tuitioning
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
to another District but I'd like to
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
address a new bill on page three lines
 
01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
and doing what's best for kids should
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
always be our priority
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
and in reality it comes down to
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
what people can afford so let me give
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
you an example this particular line I'm
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
referencing says that a student
 
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.390 align:start position:0%
referencing says that a student
reassigned

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
reassigned
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
would the average daily membership would
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
be counted on the students resident
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
School District so I interpreted that as
 
01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
that school district would receive
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
adequacy at a base cost of 3 800 per
 
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.590 align:start position:0%
adequacy at a base cost of 3 800 per
pupil

01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
the next line says that any tuition
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be forwarded to that other
 
01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
would be forwarded to that other
District

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
so let's take an average per pupil cost
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
on the low end of twenty five thousand
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil so that that says a
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
district needs to provide that
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
difference of money
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
now given that scenario
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that from a property poor
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
District that has only 50 to 55 percent
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
taxable property
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
because the other 45 percent is federal
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
and state National Forest lands
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
and a property tax of 39 per thousand
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd want to know
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
what impact do you feel this should
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
weigh on a taxpayer
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
um to come up with a difference in the
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
money and to add to that
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
in 2013
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
my district had the free spending in the
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
month of January because we had expenses
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
whether it was not a district placement
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
or other expenses that hadn't been
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
budgeted for
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the town is not going to give more
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
money would you see the role of a
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
taxpayer playing a role here
 
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I didn't I
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
didn't really
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
um I heard a lot of uh numbers and and
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
the cost and not a lot of question about
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of the
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
child or or if the the needs are being
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
met and so I think that that when we are
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
having the discussion with the taxpayer
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
in that situation we will be discussing
 
01:26:42.179 --> 01:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
in that situation we will be discussing
that

01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
um that these are the that we are trying
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
to educate the children in the best way
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
and and trying to meet the needs of that
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
child and so
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
we would have to explain that this is a
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
educating the child and that is
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't we would not want
 
01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:09.530 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't we would not want
to

01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
um give this
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
um this child uh negative
 
01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:16.629 align:start position:0%
um this child uh negative
um

01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
like a setback in life just because it
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
um hard or that the the budget
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
was more difficult I think that we would
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
bring in that discussion we would bring
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
the the needs of the child into the
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
Forefront of the discussion so thank you
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you thank you
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thanks for
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um so along the
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
same lines is what representative
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
cascadden was asking about let's take an
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
example of of another two towns that are
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
um that are about
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
um you know 20 minutes half hour away
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
from each other uh Hopkinton one of the
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
towns that I represent in Newport
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
um about uh 20 miles away and um and
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
very interesting school districts
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
because both of them have some of the
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
highest property tax rates in the state
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
but are on the opposite ends of the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
Spectrum in terms of student outcomes
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I hear what you're saying in terms
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
of the importance of of looking out for
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
students and and making sure we get good
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
student outcomes I think we probably all
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
agree on that but um but would you
 
01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.790 align:start position:0%
agree on that but um but would you
support

01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
support
um

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
would you support uh this well again
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
Newport and Hopkinton both with high tax
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
rates Hopkinton just barely able to to
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
coming up with the resources it needs
 
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
for strong student outcomes Newport
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
even with a high tax rate can't come up
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
with the resources they need for uh for
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh for us for a good school budget to
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
deliver strong student outcomes would
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
you support the state applying its
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
resources in a way to help out school
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
districts like Newport have access to
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to serve their
 
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.729 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to serve their
residents

01:29:12.729 --> 01:29:12.739 align:start position:0%
residents
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
um what I
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
um am hearing out of your question and
 
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.970 align:start position:0%
um am hearing out of your question and
or

01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.229 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.930 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.689 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the cost
 
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.169 align:start position:0%
that the cost
um

01:29:33.169 --> 01:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
the cost per student is not always or
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's not always correlated with student
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes like the cause per pupils spent
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
on the student is not always correlative
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the student outcomes and so no no I
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure you're not
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
putting those words in my mouth because
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
I did not say that and the facts do not
 
01:29:57.610 --> 01:29:57.620 align:start position:0%
reflect that
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification okay
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
that then um
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
your your example had two towns with
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
both High tax rates and one was meeting
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
the needs of students
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
and one of them wasn't
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
and both of them both have high tax
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
rates and so the question
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
in that sense scenario is that maybe one
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
is not uh maybe they need to you know
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
change what they're doing to model more
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the one that's
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs I don't I don't think
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to solve that
 
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.290 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to solve that
issue

01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so the the tax rate is
 
01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.010 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so the the tax rate is
neither

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
neither
 
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:49.610 align:start position:0%
neither
um

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
you know a high tax rate doesn't mean
 
01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:53.219 align:start position:0%
that you're needing the needs of the the
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
children so I think that the goal should
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
be meeting the needs of the children and
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
not focused as much on the tax rate
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
specifically follow up Mr chair a quick
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
one yeah it will be quick so so uh
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hopkins able to meet the needs of its
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
children with a high tax rate uh to
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
raise a a school budget that's um that's
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
very much sort of State average on a per
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
pupil basis Newport not having access to
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
the resources it needs still a very high
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
tax rate higher than Hopkins tax rate
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
um can't even come close with that
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're trying as hard as they can So
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
based on your answer are you suggesting
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
that Newport res taxpayers need to work
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
even harder maybe
 
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
um another 20 30 40 50 on their tax rate
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
to uh to try to put together a
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
reasonable school budget and uh and have
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
this uh similar outcomes or Statewide
 
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.729 align:start position:0%
this uh similar outcomes or Statewide
outcomes

01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification uh no I
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't agree that more
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
money means better outcomes so I I think
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
that there may be other uh Solutions but
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that money if you
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
already are putting a lot a significant
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money towards the the um this
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of the child I don't
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
always the solution is putting more
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
money towards that so what other
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
Solutions are you talking about hold on
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%

many of you knew uh Elizabeth Edwards
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
when she was in the house a few years
 
01:33:20.699 --> 01:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
when she was in the house a few years
ago

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth when she was about
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
eight or nine years old she uh she was
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
with us when we moved to St Louis and uh
 
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
we went we went into a very nice School
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
District The Rockwood School District
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
and but my daughter had exceptional
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
needs and they couldn't really meet them
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
in the Rockwood School District so I I
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with all of the
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
administrators and leadership in the
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
Rockwood schools to see if we could
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to give her the
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
full-time support that she needed
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
instead of a part-time support and
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and it had and they just couldn't do
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
it there was there was no way to make it
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
happen so it happened one day that I
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
took a friend of mine from work I I
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
dropped her off her at her house and I
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
saw a little cute
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
School in the neighborhood and I thought
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
oh that's a cute school I'll just stick
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
my head in there for some reason they
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
had a deal on the wall talking about the
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
exactly the kind of program that my
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
daughter needed exactly so I made an
 
01:34:26.699 --> 01:34:27.550 align:start position:0%
daughter needed exactly so I made an
appointment

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
impromptu appointment to talk to the
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
principal and and talk to her about my
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
daughter and said hey she said if you
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
bring your daughter here you're going to
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
have to worry about the transportation
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
we don't handle the transportation but
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
if she meets the eligibility she's she's
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to come and I said
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
this is so great I'm in the Rockwood
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
School District I'm talking to those
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
people and this is exactly what they
 
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
need I wonder why they don't know and
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
the principal let me know well they do
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
know as a matter of fact the person
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking to is on our board she
 
01:34:58.570 --> 01:34:58.580 align:start position:0%
knows all about this program
 
01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:02.540 align:start position:0%
that person withheld information from me
 
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
that would have helped my wife and I
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
transfer our daughter much sooner to
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
this program that would have benefited
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
her and the reason she didn't do it is
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
because when the child transferred the
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
school district had to transfer at the
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
time it was five thousand dollars is 25
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
years ago and she was more interested in
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
keeping the head count for her program
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
and keeping the money that she was in my
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
daughter and here 25 plus years later
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
I'm still hostile and angry that my
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
child was viewed as the property of that
 
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
school district and that they were
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
holding information from the US as
 
01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:46.940 align:start position:0%
parents that that would have helped so
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
fortunately we were in a rental
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
situation and we got we went ahead and
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
got my daughter enrolled into this
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
program it was just great for her and
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
because we were in a rental situation
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
had the resources we moved you know
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
within a few blocks of this school
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
building and everything worked out
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
really great so so what I am a strong
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
advocate for is school choice this we
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
need to worry about the kids one kid at
 
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
a time what's in their best interests
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
and all this money stuff we can figure
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
it out this is this is why we have
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
adults involved in the education system
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to figure out this stuff
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
so that the kids can benefit from having
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
the best possible education for their
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
needs and I would ask you to find a way
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
to support this bill whether you know I
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
need some kind of an amendment around
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
the money limiting the money from one
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
school district or another right you
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
know I let's worry about the money
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
separate but let's worry about the kids
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
first and foremost thank you thank you
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
very much representative are there
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
questions for our representative Edwards
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh Louise
 
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh Louise
Spencer

01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
hi Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you members of the
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Louise Spencer and
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm from Concord I'm also co-founder of
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the Kemp Street Coalition which is an
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
all-volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
organization education is one of our
 
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.250 align:start position:0%
organization education is one of our
Prime

01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:27.260 align:start position:0%
Prime
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
issues that we focus on
 
01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:31.510 align:start position:0%
issues that we focus on
um

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
so this this build would be just another
 
01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
blow to the struggling schools in our
 
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
state because it would allow let's face
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
it the majority of kids that may be
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
looking to move out of their districts
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
would be moving out of schools that are
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
underfunded that don't have the programs
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
that are needed we heard about
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
Allenstown perhaps having to cut what
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
parent wouldn't want to look for the
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
best possible school for their child but
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
those struggling schools would not only
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
lose the money for the student but then
 
01:38:13.570 --> 01:38:13.580 align:start position:0%
be faced with also having to pay
 
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
additional money to another District to
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
the tune of paying more than what they
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
would pay to educate the child in their
 
01:38:27.729 --> 01:38:27.739 align:start position:0%
own District creating a incredible
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
and in all deference to the chairman I
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
think this bill is all about disparity
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
and funding in our schools and our
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
failure to make sure that we are doing
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
what we must do
 
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
so that all our schools can perform and
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
provide what is needed now that means of
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
course occasionally a child is not going
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
to get their their needs met in a school
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
and we already have a bill a statute
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
that allows schools to look at moving
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
their child moving a child if that this
 
01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:11.060 align:start position:0%
that school district or that school
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
definitely cannot meet the needs of that
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
child but that's very different from
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed here which is
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
basically putting it in the hands of the
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
parents to say I'm going to send my
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
child where I choose to send my child
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
and the districts can you know
 
01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
regardless of what I'm paying for taxes
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
the districts can figure that out and
 
01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
figure it out how that's going to be
 
01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.750 align:start position:0%
figure it out how that's going to be
paid

01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.870 align:start position:0%
paid
um

01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
I've seen Brill after Bill after Bill in
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
this committee that allows for
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
certain children to get certain
 
01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
certain children to get certain
privileges

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
privileges
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
because they have parents who are there
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
and available to advocate for them and
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
that's a really wonderful thing if you
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
are lucky enough as a child to have a
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
parent who can advocate for you
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
but not all children have that not all
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
children have parents who have the
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
capacity for whatever reason that these
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
are often very loving parents but they
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
because of work because of other other
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
things they they don't necessarily have
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
the capacity to advocate for their
 
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
children so what we need to do is fix
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
our schools for all children all of the
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
children not allow certain kids to be
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
pulled out of schools that pull money
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
and resources out of those schools and
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
then allow just the remaining students
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
to have to deal with the the remains of
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
you know what's left to them
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
we talk about the best interests of the
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
child someone was saying oh because
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about funding we're not
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
talking about the best interest of the
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
child well it's in the best interest of
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
every child in our state to have strong
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
public schools in every community and we
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
need to stop focusing on allowing one
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
child to pull money out of one district
 
01:41:14.330 --> 01:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
and put it you know into homeschooling
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
or another District we need to start
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
talking about how we're going to fund
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
our schools our Public Schools how we're
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
going to meet the Mandate of Claremont
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
and adequate education so with that I
 
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
and adequate education so with that I
will

01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.810 align:start position:0%
will
um

01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
I will conclude my testimony are there
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much okay
 
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you the last card I have here uh
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning my name is
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
Sarah Smith thank you for taking my
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
comments and on this bill I wasn't
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
really intending to speak but as I was
 
01:42:05.209 --> 01:42:05.219 align:start position:0%
listening to this it did occur to me I
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
have something relevant to say
 
01:42:08.219 --> 01:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
have something relevant to say
um

01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh as I was growing up in Montgomery
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
County Maryland I went to school in the
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
in the in the local schools and because
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh the the county funded was the
 
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal person for the for all of the
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
districts within it
 
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
all the schools and there were 30 or 40
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
high schools it was big
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
um but they allowed us to switch high
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
schools if we wanted to
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
um because it was all funded together
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
didn't matter there's a school with a
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
special program I wanted to go to and I
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I just signed up and switched and
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
provided my own transportation to get
 
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:51.890 align:start position:0%
provided my own transportation to get
there

01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so it was it this this uh I I like
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
the idea of having this kind of
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility but I don't think it will
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
work under our current system
 
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
our current system of funding by the
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
towns is we're not allowed would not
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
make this a fair system at all
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
um I live in the town of Pembroke and
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember that
 
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
a few years ago not too long ago we had
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
a we had a situation where we get we get
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
students tuitioned in from other
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
districts and there was a miscalculation
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
on the the amount of students coming in
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
um and we had to make up a million
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in our budget and we got a bell
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
for an extra thousand dollars
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of months later without any
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
other preparation we knew we had maybe a
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh I don't remember exactly maybe a
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
couple weeks noticed that we were going
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
to get this big huge bill in addition to
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
what we were already paying which is
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
pretty large in Pembroke
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think this this will work
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
under our current system just the
 
01:44:00.659 --> 01:44:01.189 align:start position:0%
under our current system just the
um

01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
our situation was caused by about I
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
think nine students who did not that
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
they were counting on who didn't sign up
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
and that's just a small little amount
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
but it was a million dollars to our town
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
cost each each of the taxpayers
 
01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:17.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere around a thousand dollars more
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
so it just won't work this this whole
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
um won't work under our current system
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in favor of switching over to a
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
county-wide system myself but that
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be on the table so uh I
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
would uh I would prefer that we uh just
 
01:44:34.739 --> 01:44:36.290 align:start position:0%
would uh I would prefer that we uh just
uh

01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
itl this bill and and uh and do
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
something more realistic about these
 
01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
issues that we have in the same thank
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much just
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
received another card here
 
01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.410 align:start position:0%
received another card here
um

01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.010 --> 01:44:57.020 align:start position:0%
is it Teresa
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
would you please not go you know the
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
last card was one minute or so and they
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
went longer so we also have to try to
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
keep I understand we're getting way
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
behind schedule so my name is Teresa
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
Cornell I'm from Loudon New Hampshire
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here um two things I have a very
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
similar story as Jazz Edwards my 20 year
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
old intervened with a child that was
 
01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
old intervened with a child that was
suiciding

01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
suiciding
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and when that child got out of uh
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampton sight word actually threatened
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
her life I worked very diligently with
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley School District and
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
Concord a school district to try and
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
make it so that she had her right to an
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
education she was a traumatized
 
01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:36.260 align:start position:0%
nightmares PTSD the whole nine yards
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
facing this child in the hall but yet
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
the school district couldn't refuse him
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
the right to attend school because the
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
whole occurrence happened outside of the
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
school so we shoehorned her in using the
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
CRT program to put tuition was at
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley tried to transfer it to
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
Concord I came up with the difference it
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
was a flip been Nightmare and my
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
daughter paid a huge price for stepping
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
into the Gap and actually ending up
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
saving this child's life by bringing it
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
to adults attention when she saw it on
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
social media
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
the following year they couldn't approve
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
the whole thing she was put into crtc
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
classes that weren't appropriate for her
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
that were way above her ability to keep
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
up with she went from a straight A
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
student to I was like losing my child
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
I ended up having no other choice but to
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
put her to Bishop Brady
 
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
so there's no Transportation also as a
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
foster mom believe me US parents we want
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
normalcy we want our kids to have what
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
we had growing up to get on the school
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
bus at the end of the driveway go down
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
and participate with their friends that
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
live in the neighborhood that's what we
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
want there's no way we're going to put
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
our child into a different School
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
District unless there's something
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
catastrophic that's going on that we see
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
our child not having the right to an
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
education we have to pay for
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
transportation so some of the issues
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
I've heard put a deadline in place
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
that so the school districts know
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
whether that child is going to be
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
attending them or not
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
um have the money that that property
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
taxpayer me as a Mom is putting it into
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
my school district let that be the
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that transfers to the
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
other school district and leave it on me
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to pay for the
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
difference of tuition if it's more if
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's 25 000 at this school district
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
versus 12 000 at this school district
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't have me have to put her into a
 
01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
private school like Bishop Brady where
 
01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
she's going to school with orthodontist
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
kids who are picking on her because she
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the right jeans on and she
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
can't compete with those families or she
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
feels like an outcast because she's not
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
Catholic right this is providing public
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
school choice this is a good Public
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
School option we want our children you
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
know to be able to go and get that right
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
to an education kids are the priority
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
the transportation I had to bring her to
 
01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
school and pick her up again it's not
 
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
something that I think we're going to
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
see huge Exodus of happening but I think
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's something that will prevent us from
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
having to put our kids into a school
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
option that's not public school and
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
finally I'm a foster mom and I can tell
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
you our foster kids as they get bounced
 
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
from home to home that is in a different
 
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
District to a different District they
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
lose out on their normalcy not only are
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
they having the loss of their family and
 
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
their friends but now they're going from
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
school to school to school this would
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
benefit benefit that population and I
 
01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
will always be an advocate for those
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
kids that's where my journey began and
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
they get lost in all of this they should
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
be able to stay in their school district
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
even if they've moved outside of that
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
District we need to Shepherd some things
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
and look at the situations and and do
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
our best if we're spending three hundred
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and that's Using twelve
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a child with 25 kids in
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
the class
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
that money certainly isn't going to the
 
01:48:46.739 --> 01:48:47.870 align:start position:0%
that money certainly isn't going to the
teacher

01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
something is going horribly wrong when
 
01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:52.940 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley school district has 45
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars for 1800 students and
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
our test scores are in the gutter
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to be done but
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
this I think is something that we can
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
put some a deadline
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
um the money that that taxpayer with
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
that Resident spends towards the school
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
district is what would follow the child
 
01:49:12.050 --> 01:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
the difference it would keep us out of
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
having to go to private schools which we
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
already are seeing the mass Exodus of
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
people homeschooling and taking them out
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the public schools altogether because
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
they're getting bullied they're not
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
getting what they need our children by
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
law have a right to an education thank
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%

move on together you'll get a hand
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
signal and then that will move on but
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor we've always taken the
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
tack that if the prime sponsor is
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
referencing the bill and and specific
 
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
things within the bill that we need to
 
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
know we've given them some latitude and
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm I plan on doing right here so
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
the first uh speaker will be the prime
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
together

02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
get right to it thank you the record uh
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike Moffett Merrimack Ford
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
lovely towns of uh Canterbury loud and
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
so I am not the original Prime sponsor
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
for this measure the original Prime
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor lost her re-election bid by 18
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
votes or whatever and is less out of our
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
current mix so is I have great respect
 
02:01:49.609 --> 02:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
for The Honorable Melissa Litchfield I
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
agree to keep her bill alive and bring
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
it forward to you today
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to cook this year a couple
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
of thoughts though of course uh in in
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
2021 this committee heard a bill
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
I was part of the committee at that time
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
and that Bill had to do with sports and
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
transgender issues it was HB 198 and as
 
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
we were still constrained by the covid
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
thing uh all the testimony appeared uh
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
happened via Zoom
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of you remember I
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
think 34 people tested by 33 of them uh
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to the bill
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
which would have limited transgender
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
participation in sports
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
so I was very moved by the testimony
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
that day and I think uh those people who
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
testified moved the needle they did for
 
02:02:33.599 --> 02:02:34.310 align:start position:0%
testified moved the needle they did for
me

02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh it broadened my awareness and
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
understanding of transgender issues I
 
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
learned some things even in my age
 
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh transgender issues were not on our
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
radar screens back when I was in high
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
school up in Groveton back in the 70s
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I mean the committee ultimately voted
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
to retain that bill so we heard the
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
people that day we heard mostly the moms
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
we heard the moms
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
so now in 2023 this committee has
 
02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:04.580 align:start position:0%
another bill here that involves again
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
transgender issues
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
HB 104 simply seeks to mandate that
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
multi-style bathrooms be designated
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
same-sex as in one bathroom for those
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
who have XX chromosomes and another
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom for those who have X Y
 
02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.290 align:start position:0%
bathroom for those who have X Y
chromosomes

02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
chromosomes
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
the knee for such a bill as this would
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
have perplexed the good folks back in
 
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
growth and in the 70s but back then boys
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
are boys and girls are girls
 
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
today 2023 things are more complicated
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh there are transgender issues that
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're still learning about
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
in trying to understand better and I
 
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:42.179 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll hear from some of the
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
same moms today that we heard last term
 
02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
and I expect these moms will again
 
02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
Advocate to let their children select
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
the locker rooms or the bathrooms in
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
which they feel most comfortable
 
02:03:54.659 --> 02:03:56.030 align:start position:0%
which they feel most comfortable
but

02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
I also expect this time around we hear
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
from some other moms as well
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh Boston media reports yesterday that
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
school officials in Milford I know you
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
have some Milford folks there are
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
considering reinstating a bathroom rule
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
there that would allow students to only
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
use the restroom or locker room
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh that's in accordance with their
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
biological sex that's a look right now
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
right now it's a local issue for Milford
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
and for other towns to deal with
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh the court policy a lot of times is to
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
allow students to use whatever bathrooms
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
they choose what could possibly go wrong
 
02:04:36.649 --> 02:04:36.659 align:start position:0%
well a lot could go wrong consider the
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
young girls in Loudoun County Virginia
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
who were assaulted in school restrooms
 
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:42.830 align:start position:0%
who were assaulted in school restrooms
there

02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
by a biological male wearing a skirt
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
timid School administrators dithered
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
and dissembled and covered up those
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
crimes down there until local outrage in
 
02:04:59.330 --> 02:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
Loudoun County Virginia
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
finally results in the firing of the
 
02:05:01.139 --> 02:05:04.790 align:start position:0%
finally results in the firing of the
superintendent

02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
Virginia subsequently passed legislation
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
mandating gender-specific bathrooms so
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature in Virginia took action
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
after the crimes after the facts
 
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:24.370 align:start position:0%
after the crimes after the facts
foreign

02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
we do not allow posters to be displayed
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
I'll see what the poster was on YouTube
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
later I'm curious so to finish yeah to
 
02:05:42.250 --> 02:05:42.260 align:start position:0%
finish up as I say uh Virginia
 
02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh took action after the crimes New
 
02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a chance to instead of
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
being reactive and pass legislation on a
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide level after
 
02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
crimes we hope there are none
 
02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
if if when
 
02:06:03.290 --> 02:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
but we I think
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
form eruption of Litchfield and many
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
others think we should be proactive
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
instead of reactive so I know I keep
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
referring to moms but there are also
 
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
dads out there
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
and no one
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
no one should underestimate the emotions
 
02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
it can be Unleashed when a dad thinks
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
his young daughters or granddaughters
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
are not safe or protected when they go
 
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
to school
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not the original sponsor she's not
 
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
here I can try to answer any questions
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
as best I can if there are any thank you
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
very much you're just getting down to
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
your time limit are there questions for
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett yes represent
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you and good morning
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett I'm curious I
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
know there is another bill in the house
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
this session to Define biological sex
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
which is also in line four of this bill
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
if that bill were to pass would it
 
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
impact the passage of this bill or would
 
02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
they contradict or conflicting anyway
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions it's a
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
great question I think it might be HP
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
396 I'm not sure what the number is
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
that's very Broad and covers a lot of
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
different things this bill that
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield uh put in is
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
specific to the bathroom in locker room
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
style issue uh great question and that's
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
something that could be funded out if
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
that other Bill also covered that this
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
then um that might make this a pro
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
Superfluous uh great question thank you
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative sure thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Moffett
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
um my question goes a little bit to the
 
02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and I just wanted to
 
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
ask would it be generally correct to say
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
that the bill is not necessarily
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a person who identifies
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
as a as another gender is likely to
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
commit a crime but rather somebody who
 
02:07:54.890 --> 02:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
is likely to commit a crime would take
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
advantage of such a policy thank you
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative this is very well put and
 
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
I want to as I try to say in my
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I I anticipate some
 
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:08.420 align:start position:0%
ideology here uh I I
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
don't want this to imply that any group
 
02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
is more prone to uh criminal Behavior
 
02:08:20.169 --> 02:08:20.179 align:start position:0%
than any other group uh the 99
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
plus of of the communities that we're
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
talking about are all wonderful people
 
02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh but the way you put it it captures
 
02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
the intent I think that Melissa
 
02:08:31.729 --> 02:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
Litchfield had it it you put it very
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett for taking my
 
02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.609 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett for taking my
question

02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
um do we know right now how many schools
 
02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
um do we know right now how many schools
allow

02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
anyone to use the bathrooms or right now
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
are bathrooms in the public schools
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
restricted based on gender or sex thank
 
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
you for the question a great question I
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what what schools do what I
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
know Milford has been in the news uh
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday they uh and so we know that
 
02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
milford's looking to change their
 
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
policies locally so right now again it's
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
a it's a a local policy decision for
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
school boards to make as to their
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
bathroom policies uh what this would do
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
would make it would be a state it would
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
be a statute a law it would cover the
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
whole state and provide some definition
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
and recover everyone which I know it
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
would not no longer be a local uh
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
position but this I go back to the
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
Virginia case the reason Virginia passed
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
a law was because the under localities
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
they they weren't protecting their young
 
02:09:35.099 --> 02:09:36.410 align:start position:0%
they they weren't protecting their young
people

02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:38.900 align:start position:0%

02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
against the transgender students and the
 
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
lbj2 community when we don't even have
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
the money to fix the heating system we
 
02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to fix all these
 
02:17:30.169 --> 02:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
issues in the school
 
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
but now someone is trying to push
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
getting money out of the budget that we
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
like negative already
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
because voucher bills they're already
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
passed and we're taking away money from
 
02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:47.099 align:start position:0%
our public school system
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
to push this
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
agenda with the bathrooms
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
let's be honest let's go back to the
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
table and do what is right for the
 
02:17:59.570 --> 02:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
students and keep putting money into the
 
02:18:01.129 --> 02:18:01.139 align:start position:0%
public schools that we can have a better
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
education this is not the way we should
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
be spending the money or the time
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
humiliating students human hearing kids
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
and then assuming that there are
 
02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
criminals and rapers
 
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
they're humans remember that we're
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
talking about kids and we should be
 
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
talking be very careful
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is our next Generation so what
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
 
02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:31.370 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
creating

02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and welcoming the safe communities for
 
02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
and welcoming the safe communities for
them

02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have enough of this representative
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
your time is up thank you please don't
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you very much uh
 
02:18:44.929 --> 02:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
the question representative
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Perez did I hear you
 
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
correctly did you say that we're taking
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
money from public schools to push this
 
02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
agenda and if so should this bill have a
 
02:18:58.250 --> 02:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to it it should
 
02:18:59.929 --> 02:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
I want to see how much they will calls
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
because to be honest in my town last
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
night what I heard they have no idea how
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
much it's gonna cost but we already have
 
02:19:11.929 --> 02:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
issues that we can't even fix because we
 
02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:14.300 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have a budget to fix them
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
um very cool this is quick
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
I haven't read that news story yet what
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
was what
 
02:19:26.089 --> 02:19:26.099 align:start position:0%
is with the money before if the
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are already
 
02:19:27.479 --> 02:19:28.849 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are already
there

02:19:28.849 --> 02:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
what are they trying to change so they
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
try to put single stools so that they
 
02:19:37.009 --> 02:19:37.019 align:start position:0%
can have a privacy on the school on the
 
02:19:40.009 --> 02:19:40.019 align:start position:0%
bathroom so they they put dividers into
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms or build new bathrooms so
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
they they they have like a wolf
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
up and down so they can have like
 
02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:51.230 align:start position:0%
up and down so they can have like
privacy

02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.849 --> 02:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for being here again
 
02:19:55.969 --> 02:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
um again with the financial aspect so
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
Milford would have to change their
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
already existing bathrooms are you aware
 
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
of other schools in the state that would
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
have a financial burden to passing this
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard from other schools but
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
to be honest what I see in my town is
 
02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
enough to be very concerned because we
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
attack property taxes already people
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
already struggling to pay property taxes
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
and our town already struggled to uh
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
have money
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
to cover other issues that we have roles
 
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
that we have the library again you know
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have other issues that we should be
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
spending the money but we spending the
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
time and money
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
to push this agenda
 
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
to put and then calling kids rapers and
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
Colin probably other things
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is not what we need okay thank you
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other further
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Belcher
 
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you referees I
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard a reference to
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
um pushing religious beliefs in regard
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
to this and I wasn't exactly sure what
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
was meant by that could you elaborate a
 
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
bit okay so
 
02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be honest to you so last
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%

a member of the school board from
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.050 --> 02:21:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
that is making difficult oh
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
a welcome transgender students in
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and lockers okay in the same
 
02:21:31.849 --> 02:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
school board member
 
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
he said he's a pastor of his church
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
and he make comments
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
of his church when he was given his
 
02:21:43.250 --> 02:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
sermon about
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
that he's pushing his agenda
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
religion for me because he's from the
 
02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
religion for me because he's from the
church

02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
church
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
and then he'd also given feel
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
he feel like he's wasting his time being
 
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
part of the meal for school board
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%

hear me
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
although it's not this pillow okay okay
 
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:29.410 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:22:29.410 --> 02:22:29.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is Betsy
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington I'm from Deering
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
this book brings up a lot of old
 
02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
feelings for me because of what I
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
experienced as a child and then as an
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
adult I was the only girl in my town who
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
played hockey I played as the only girl
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
even through high school back in the 80s
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
I eventually tried out for the Olympics
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
in women's hockey
 
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
I dealt with a lot of sex discrimination
 
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
and had many uncomfortable situations
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
being so far outside the norm of that
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
time one rule that made sense was that I
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
was not to change in the boy's locker
 
02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:02.450 align:start position:0%
was not to change in the boy's locker
room

02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:23:04.370 --> 02:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
it was uncomfortable for me because I
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
had to go to the ladies room and change
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
on the dirty floor
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
I did not have appropriate space to
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
change or shower like the boys did the
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
combinations were not made
 
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
I wanted to play and those were the
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
boundaries I had so I stayed within them
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
even though they seemed unfair to me
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
I've never told anybody this part
 
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
as an adult I caught an adult male
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
recording me while I was fully naked in
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
the bathroom he had a tiny camera
 
02:23:34.809 --> 02:23:34.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
I saw them when I had bent over between
 
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
my legs I freaked out he immediately
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
stomped on that camera and smashed it I
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
don't know what was on it I don't know
 
02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
anything about that recording
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
I see places where I fully unclothed as
 
02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
sacred my situation would be more likely
 
02:23:58.490 --> 02:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
if we allowed biological men in women's
 
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
spaces it makes sense to separate
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
bathrooms by one's genitals which is how
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
the separation of these faces began we
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
use facilities differently if I were
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
menstruating I wouldn't want that known
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
having a male in the next stall gives no
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
privacy or safety once I unwrap my
 
02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
products I imagine the neighboring stall
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
will hear and maybe even make an
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable comment this is one reason
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
why we are separated by our genitalia in
 
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
the first place we have different needs
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
and fears losing our private spaces to
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
people who were born men defeats the
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of the separation in the first
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
place their need for a space did not
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
negate ours I'm sorry but like I
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
experienced as a child use the bathroom
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
that fits your genitals even if it's
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it's life it's the
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
boundaries that exist I can accept that
 
02:24:46.130 --> 02:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
some discomfort is present for someone
 
02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
identifying outside their biology but
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
the ladies in the bathroom would be
 
02:24:52.130 --> 02:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
trans for that discomfort if we gave up
 
02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
our space to biological men snowman is
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
going to live with some discomfort
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
should it be a few biological men or all
 
02:25:02.570 --> 02:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
women who wins same-sex spaces should
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
remain as they were decided by your
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
genitals thank you thank you very much
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
are there questions of Miss Harrington
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative pettineau
 
02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss
 
02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
Harrington for your testimony and for
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you suggest separating people by
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
their genitals but what about the
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
instances where genitalia has been
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
personally I feel like if you made that
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
commitment to become a woman and it
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
you're fully surgically altered I would
 
02:25:39.889 --> 02:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
be less afraid right because you're not
 
02:25:42.050 --> 02:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
going to rape me in that way
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
so I I would say if you've made that
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
commitment I would be more comfortable I
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
think it's really for me it's about the
 
02:25:50.399 --> 02:25:52.429 align:start position:0%
think it's really for me it's about the
genitalia

02:25:52.429 --> 02:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
genitalia
 
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:55.969 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
questions

02:25:55.969 --> 02:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:25:58.610 --> 02:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today thanks
 
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the time good morning slash
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Anne-Marie Banfield
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a parental rights advocate in New
 
02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been doing this for 20
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
years at least I think chairman Ladd is
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
probably the only person on this
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
committee that has known me that long
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I need to also mention that I've
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
never been compensated for this I do
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
this because what basically why you do
 
02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:37.460 align:start position:0%
it you feel compelled
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh I do have written testimony but I'm
 
02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
going to try to make this very brief
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
because I do represent thousands of
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
parents in the state and because
 
02:26:49.250 --> 02:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
thousands of parents follow me and I
 
02:26:51.410 --> 02:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
represent so many of them I'll just
 
02:26:53.929 --> 02:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
bring up a couple of the issues that
 
02:26:56.929 --> 02:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
they're facing with this in their own
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
schools I helped a parent in Northampton
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
over the summer whose eighth grade
 
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
daughter went and talked before the
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
school board saying that if they passed
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
the jbab policy which I'm sure you're
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
all familiar with that allows anybody to
 
02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom based on gender
 
02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
identity that this eighth grade student
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
testified before the school board saying
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the girls would not be feel
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable going into the restroom and
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
that they would hold it and that's what
 
02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing so this is impacting girls
 
02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing so this is impacting girls
already

02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and it's impacting boys I hear from
 
02:27:30.050 --> 02:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
um parents of boys also who are just not
 
02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable in a modest situation
 
02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
so there's many reasons why a student
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use a restroom this is
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
certainly one of them but you do have
 
02:27:42.050 --> 02:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
but you serve all students you serve
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
transgender students too in your
 
02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
District so obviously there has to be
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of compromise and what I think
 
02:27:52.610 --> 02:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
most people are comfortable with is
 
02:27:54.889 --> 02:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
something like this where you have a
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
female restroom for the biological
 
02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
females and males for biological males
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
and then you offer transgender students
 
02:28:04.849 --> 02:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
something where they feel safe it's not
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
that you want to put them in an unsafe
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
position and I understand that and I
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
would agree with that but there has to
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
be some kind of compromise
 
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh this is perfectly legal to do this
 
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
also and Ian Hewitt from Cornerstone who
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
is the attorney that spoke in Milford
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
explained how this is legal I don't see
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
him here today but if you go back to the
 
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
Milford school board meeting you can
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
hear his testimony there or I'm sure
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
maybe he's sending it to you already
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amendment in terms of if
 
02:28:38.330 --> 02:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
a mother brings a a small son into the
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
restroom that might be a good amendment
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
to to add to this as I think you brought
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
up what if a mother I mean if that needs
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
to be spelled out then you spell it out
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment I think that that's
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate other than that I think
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
um let me say I want to make sure that I
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
covered everything
 
02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:57.710 align:start position:0%
covered everything
um

02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
I oh I visit schools all the time I was
 
02:29:02.210 --> 02:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
at a deliberative session last night so
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
as an adult adults are also going into
 
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
this restrooms sometimes with children
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
so do you want adult male who identifies
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
maybe as a female going in with a
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
six-year-old girl you know you got to
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
think about all the scenarios that could
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
possibly happen
 
02:29:20.889 --> 02:29:20.899 align:start position:0%
thank you that's my three minutes
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes representative
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
02:29:27.290 --> 02:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think you have a
 
02:29:29.170 --> 02:29:29.180 align:start position:0%
copy of the bill in front of you
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
and as I read it when it says all
 
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
multi-stall bathrooms and locker rooms
 
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
in all New Hampshire Public Schools
 
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the bill is
 
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
precluding uh what you said to have a
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
family bathroom like they have in
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
airports and public places or a
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
gender-neutral bathroom in the school
 
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
um do you read that as
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
as what I'm saying that the bill is
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
written excludes that
 
02:29:58.849 --> 02:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
I I think what you're doing is you're
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the situation of how do we
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
how do you address it at the local level
 
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's up to your local
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
officials and they're doing that already
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
so in the case of Northampton for
 
02:30:11.450 --> 02:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
instance they did not adopt the jbab
 
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
policy uh and so I'm assuming that
 
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
they're that they're already using this
 
02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
as part of their practice in the school
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you serve your
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
transgender students if there's only one
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that they're going to make
 
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
sure that there is maybe the teachers
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
launch I know I've heard of taking them
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the Teachers Lounge shoes restroom
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
the problem with when it's open to
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
anybody is the girls have started
 
02:30:41.210 --> 02:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
complaining that the line forms let's
 
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
say that they say okay girls you go use
 
02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
that one stall bathroom so you have a
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
long line of girls out there waiting to
 
02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
use one restroom versus something that's
 
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
a little more logical and you ask okay
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
to our transgender students we're going
 
02:30:58.130 --> 02:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
to offer this one rest because there's a
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
very small percentage in the school but
 
02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
I think by by stating this then the
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
schools have the opportunity to be
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
creative on how they
 
02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
um how they serve also their transgender
 
02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
students if that makes sense you know
 
02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that so are you
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
saying let me get it correctly that this
 
02:31:21.170 --> 02:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
bill that that if there's a bathroom in
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
um middle or high school it has to be
 
02:31:28.969 --> 02:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
designated as a sex only bathroom like a
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
female bathroom or a male bathroom and
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
that because it says all bathrooms in
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
all locker rooms there can't be it it
 
02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
excludes a public bathroom that's
 
02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
labeled either family or neutral I I
 
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I don't read it that way I
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
would read it that the boys restroom is
 
02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
the boys restroom and the girls restroom
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
is the girls restroom and if they have
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
another single stall bathroom that this
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
would certainly allow for something it
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
was multi-stall like a locker room if
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
they had a section of a locker room that
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
was family or gender neutral I I would
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
assume that that would have to be again
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
a local discussion about how to serve
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
those students without violating without
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
with making sure that these restrooms
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
are available to those kids because
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're already labeled if you go into
 
02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
schools they're already late they're
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
already labeled yes
 
02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions thank you
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:31.969 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.979 --> 02:32:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:42.110 --> 02:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is Bill
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
Blum and I currently live in Atkinson
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I am here today to
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition of HB 104. I'm proud
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
to say that living in New Hampshire for
 
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
the last 18 years and truly now living
 
02:32:56.210 --> 02:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
our state motto Live Free or Die yes HB
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
104 defines bathroom segregation schools
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I will not speak to direct
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
experience as a minor in regards to this
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
as I am obviously not currently living
 
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
within this age group
 
02:33:08.929 --> 02:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
however I will speak as someone whose
 
02:33:11.090 --> 02:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
story and authentic self will kept in a
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
closet for more than 30 years of my life
 
02:33:15.410 --> 02:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
up until recently I was not living free
 
02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
my soul was actually dying
 
02:33:21.410 --> 02:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
not living my authentic life caused me
 
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
to be confrontational short-sighted and
 
02:33:26.090 --> 02:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
just plain mean ultimately not being
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
honest and open with myself and others
 
02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
about who I was cost me my job as well
 
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
as my marriage
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
the good news is I am still here and now
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
more so than ever
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
I am choosing not to die
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately bring being present in
 
02:33:42.349 --> 02:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
this building over the last few weeks
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
has taught me that more than half of our
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
state's adolescent transgender and
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
non-binary Community are actually
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
considering death
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
and even more alarming to me and
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully to you as well
 
02:33:56.090 --> 02:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
more than a quarter of The Adolescents
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
in transgender and non-binary Community
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
actually attempt to complete John
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
Stark's statement in the obviously wrong
 
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:04.370 align:start position:0%
Stark's statement in the obviously wrong
manner

02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
as someone who has both used the male
 
02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
and female restrooms throughout the
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
state I will now share some inside
 
02:34:11.570 --> 02:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
information with you all both the
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
women's and males bathrooms have stalls
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
for privacy the male bathrooms have
 
02:34:16.610 --> 02:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
urinals in the women's bathrooms do not
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
the women's bathrooms do however have
 
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
little Trash boxes in each stall for
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
things that do not go down the toilet
 
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the man's bathrooms do not and they
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
both have sinks too optionally use after
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
one uses the bathroom to stop the spread
 
02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
imagine this one second it is between
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
periods at the Whittemore Arena during a
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
UNH versus Humane game
 
02:34:41.690 --> 02:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
I need to use the bathroom and I go in
 
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm simply not there to look around
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
guess what is really going on with other
 
02:34:46.250 --> 02:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
people the point is to use the restroom
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
for what it is intended for and to get
 
02:34:49.849 --> 02:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
back to your seat or the beer line
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
before the game restarts
 
02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
I will just leave you with one simple
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
question given the fact that I have had
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
two cups of coffee this morning
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
which bathroom should I use to not be a
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
target of discrimination and hate if I
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
were to Simply live free and not die in
 
02:35:08.929 --> 02:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
The Sacred and historic building today
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time thank you
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%

02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:13.730 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
committee

02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much for
 
02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
coming you're welcome
 
02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is Don
 
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
Johnson I'm from Laconia I'm a parent
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a school board member
 
02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to speak today but I have
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
after listening and talking to many kids
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
having opposite sex in a bathroom when a
 
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
woman or a man
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
is going in to use the facilities is
 
02:36:01.370 --> 02:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable many of these
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
students are now not choosing to use the
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
restrooms if they
 
02:36:08.929 --> 02:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
are open to the opposite sex to go and
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
use the restrooms these kids are already
 
02:36:14.330 --> 02:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
having enough hard time
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
going through puberty and everything
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
else and finding their own way
 
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
and to make them feel uncomfortable to
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
go in and leave themselves is absolutely
 
02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
go in and leave themselves is absolutely
horrifying

02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
horrifying
 
02:36:29.210 --> 02:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
I know many kids will rush home
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannot wait to get off the bus or get
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
out of their cars to use the restroom at
 
02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
home because they are in fear of what
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
might happen and the embarrassment that
 
02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
they may have in a locker room or in a
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom I applaud you please support
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and let's protect our kids
 
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:49.370 --> 02:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.370 --> 02:37:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how to say it anyway
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm here as a mother and I am here as
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
a former teacher
 
02:37:19.969 --> 02:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
um I have 20 years of experience in the
 
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
school system
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm also a mother of two students who
 
02:37:27.170 --> 02:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
have medical conditions and in order to
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
get any accommodations for them we
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
always had to file for 504 plans
 
02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
so as far as I am concerned gender
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and transgender is a medical
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
condition and if a student needs
 
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
accommodations then they need to go
 
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
through these meetings and let me just
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
tell you if you've ever been to a 504
 
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
meeting it is not easy it is not easy to
 
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
get accommodations for any child no
 
02:37:53.809 --> 02:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
matter how many pieces of documentation
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
you bring and how much medical
 
02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:56.990 align:start position:0%
you bring and how much medical
information

02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
people talk about being harassed my
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
children were harassed continually
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
because they would ask for
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
accommodations from teachers who would
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
not give them the accommodations that
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
that were agreed to in the 504 plan
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
a simple accommodation as getting extra
 
02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
time on a test or extra time to complete
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
homework this is not impacting any other
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
student in a school system other than my
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
child who was not given the extra time
 
02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
to get an assignment in or to take a
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
test because of a medical condition
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
that is wrong
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
the accommodations that are going to
 
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
affect other kids those other kids need
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
to be taken into account I would not
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable having a male in the
 
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
bathroom with me at any time and neither
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
should my child or any other child be
 
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
forced to take that and be in that
 
02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.570 align:start position:0%
forced to take that and be in that
situation

02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:52.130 align:start position:0%
situation
um

02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:54.770 --> 02:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
and again if there is a medical problem
 
02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
then yes then those students need to
 
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
have a 504 plan they cannot come in one
 
02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
day and say I'm going to go in the other
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
person's bathroom because I feel like
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
that this day that should not be allowed
 
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a 504 plan there needs
 
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
to be medical diagnoses and there needs
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be documentation on how that child
 
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
not being able that child being able to
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
go into whatever bathroom they want to
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
will affect their Educational Learning
 
02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that affecting a child's
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
learning ability and that is not part of
 
02:39:29.389 --> 02:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
the children's curriculum
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
so please protect the girls please
 
02:39:34.250 --> 02:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
protect the bathrooms thank you very
 
02:39:35.929 --> 02:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
much I apologize for the I didn't yell
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
that's all right your manuscript's
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you that of a teacher uh
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
02:39:50.809 --> 02:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
testimony If This Were to pass do you
 
02:39:53.929 --> 02:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
see it preventing these IEP or five or
 
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
four meetings from accommodating
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
transgender youth students that is going
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
to need to go to the federal because
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
these are both federal laws so you would
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
have to look into seeing what the
 
02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
federal law and there are
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
um different requirements in order to
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
meet the accommodations so my one child
 
02:40:15.170 --> 02:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
who has a medical condition she did not
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
qualify for an IAP because she didn't
 
02:40:19.130 --> 02:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
meet the standards
 
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
so there are standards within those
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
programs as to whether or not
 
02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
accommodation meets and will be allowed
 
02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you that's a good
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
question accommodations and
 
02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
modifications yes it's at the federal
 
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:32.510 align:start position:0%
modifications yes it's at the federal
level

02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you no Pam
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:58.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:40:58.570 --> 02:40:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:00.770 --> 02:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I speak today
 
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
as chair of the building code review
 
02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
board and respectful opposition to this
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill not because I particularly disagree
 
02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
with the premise but based on a general
 
02:41:12.050 --> 02:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
position that amendments to the building
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
code should be at the code level and not
 
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
written at a law
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
I'd also note that in my professional
 
02:41:19.250 --> 02:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
career I've been dealing with this issue
 
02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
for many years now the current New
 
02:41:24.050 --> 02:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building code addresses this
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
issue where the 2018 International
 
02:41:28.250 --> 02:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
building and plumbing codes which are
 
02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
the model codes that the state building
 
02:41:33.370 --> 02:41:33.380 align:start position:0%
code is based on prohibit
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
require most multi-fiction facilities to
 
02:41:38.929 --> 02:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
be single sex
 
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
the bcrb is currently reviewing and
 
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
holding public hearings on the 2021
 
02:41:46.370 --> 02:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
International codes where the model
 
02:41:49.130 --> 02:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
codes will in fact permit multi-stall
 
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
facilities to be all gender these are
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes referred to as the European
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
style restrooms
 
02:41:57.410 --> 02:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
if things stay on schedule and the codes
 
02:41:59.630 --> 02:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
are approved the 2021 codes would go
 
02:42:03.170 --> 02:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
into effect by the summer of 2024.
 
02:42:06.170 --> 02:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
in the past gentle or not so gentle
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
pressure from the legislature has
 
02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
resulted in amendments through our board
 
02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
reflecting the desired technical outcome
 
02:42:15.650 --> 02:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
while preserving the right for designers
 
02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
Builders owners and users to request
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
local relay from code Provisions for
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
special circumstances changes in opinion
 
02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
by interested parties or federal
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
requirements once written into law no
 
02:42:31.969 --> 02:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
relief or modification is available
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
failing the provision of the desired
 
02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment the legislature still through
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
our board the legislature would still
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
have time to revisit this issue before
 
02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
the current codes expire
 
02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refer to what I think of as
 
02:42:50.090 --> 02:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 0.0 I'm speaking facetiously but
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
that refers to the law of unintended
 
02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:53.530 align:start position:0%
that refers to the law of unintended
consequences

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:53.540 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
02:42:55.849 --> 02:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
we have three
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'll call them code Provisions written
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
into our RSA 155a currently biomass
 
02:43:05.210 --> 02:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
boilers log homes and arc fault circuit
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
interrupters two of those three are out
 
02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
of date and ready for repeal because
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
they've gottens fail they've been they
 
02:43:14.929 --> 02:43:14.939 align:start position:0%
just have been out of date so I would
 
02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
caution you about writing this kind of a
 
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
rule in the law things change very
 
02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:20.330 align:start position:0%
rule in the law things change very
quickly

02:43:20.330 --> 02:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'd also mention that there are other
 
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
occupancies where this is probably of
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
Interest summer camps and public
 
02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
swimming pools come to mind same kinds
 
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
of issues
 
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
so I request that you consider defeating
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
this bill we would look forward to
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
working with interested parties to
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
develop the appropriate amendments to
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code and lastly if
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
you do pass this bill I would strongly
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommend that it be located in RSA 155a
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
were amendments to the building code are
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
located so that the folks that deal with
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
building construction can find it thank
 
02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much are
 
02:43:59.570 --> 02:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
there questions representative uh try
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh is there a
 
02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:04.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh is there a
difference

02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
is there a difference
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
um because public schools are
 
02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
government schools that rather than
 
02:44:14.809 --> 02:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
private State summer camps for example
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
the code deals with occupancies and
 
02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
schools in general below the 12th grade
 
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
are group E occupancy so it's
 
02:44:24.650 --> 02:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
independent of whether their government
 
02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
or uh public or private uh if you look
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
at things like public swimming pools
 
02:44:33.469 --> 02:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
they could be at a hotel which would not
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
come under the group b Provisions but
 
02:44:38.690 --> 02:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
for our purposes
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
I would say pretty much the schools
 
02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:43.979 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are all group E
 
02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
there may be some exceptions at the
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
lower end of the age bracket follow-ups
 
02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:51.349 align:start position:0%
lower end of the age bracket follow-ups
yes

02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
given what you've heard from the
 
02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
testimony here is could you give us an
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
idea what a path for compromise might
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
look like if you sat down with us
 
02:45:01.849 --> 02:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
years ago I worked with representatives
 
02:45:04.250 --> 02:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
from the Yale law school who were on the
 
02:45:05.809 --> 02:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
sort of Leading Edge of this whole
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and it's pretty clear that
 
02:45:11.210 --> 02:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
the that the compromise if you will
 
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
solution as one of the other speakers
 
02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:16.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned is single-user restrooms
 
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
many schools are putting a lot of them
 
02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
in now because mostly because of
 
02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:22.330 align:start position:0%
in now because mostly because of
bullying

02:45:22.330 --> 02:45:22.340 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
so that allows you to preserve the
 
02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
multi-stall traditional restroom
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
arrangement in schools and provide a
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of single user
 
02:45:32.929 --> 02:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
restrooms which people may want to use
 
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
for a number of different reasons that
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
costs money there's no question about it
 
02:45:41.809 --> 02:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Belcher
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
that testimony um you mentioned that
 
02:45:47.090 --> 02:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
your organization has worked with the
 
02:45:49.809 --> 02:45:49.819 align:start position:0%
legislature before sometimes we utilize
 
02:45:52.490 --> 02:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
gentle means sometimes not so gentle
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
means to persuasion
 
02:45:57.650 --> 02:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
would passing this bill not qualify as a
 
02:45:59.929 --> 02:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
not so gentle means of persuasion to get
 
02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
this done it it certainly would get to
 
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
the heart of the matter the the problem
 
02:46:07.730 --> 02:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
we've had is when we write
 
02:46:10.570 --> 02:46:10.580 align:start position:0%
prescriptive code requirements into law
 
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
there's no room to maneuver the things
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we haven't thought about today
 
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
can't be dealt with out in the field and
 
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
then we've got a law that's just that
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
much harder to get revised later
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
so we just that's why we have building
 
02:46:25.969 --> 02:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
codes and we don't write every word of
 
02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
the building code into a law
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are lots of circumstances that
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
come up that we probably don't
 
02:46:34.969 --> 02:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
understand sitting here today so
 
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would you be so kind
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
as to email your testimony to the
 
02:46:43.370 --> 02:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
committee it's very helpful I have it
 
02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
written I've done enough editing that
 
02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:47.420 align:start position:0%
I'll send it to the clerk this afternoon
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:55.849 --> 02:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh earlier on representative Tanner
 
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
asked a question of one of the speakers
 
02:46:59.270 --> 02:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
and did you have the bill in front of
 
02:46:59.280 --> 02:46:59.929 align:start position:0%
and did you have the bill in front of
you

02:46:59.929 --> 02:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay thank you I'm looking at
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
line three the first word of the line
 
02:47:08.690 --> 02:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
says all
 
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
so from your building code expertise
 
02:47:12.490 --> 02:47:12.500 align:start position:0%
with that would you
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
presume then and that means every single
 
02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:17.450 align:start position:0%
presume then and that means every single
bathroom

02:47:17.450 --> 02:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things to be careful of and
 
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
this gets societal issues as overlapping
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
with construction issues is that this
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
would apply to existing as well as new
 
02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
construction clearly that can be dealt
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
with through the codes but it needs to
 
02:47:35.570 --> 02:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
be dealt with explicitly right typically
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
the building code only applies when a
 
02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
building is being constructed or altered
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
okay new construction
 
02:47:45.170 --> 02:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
or alterations right right yeah may I
 
02:47:47.210 --> 02:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
ask one more go ahead thank you
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so with this from a building code
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
perspective uh eliminate uh gender
 
02:47:58.370 --> 02:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.849 --> 02:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
in group e
 
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
forgive me I think this this refers to
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
public schools and Charters so I'd make
 
02:48:08.809 --> 02:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
it clear that it applies to private
 
02:48:11.570 --> 02:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
schools right uh
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
it would it would eliminate all gender
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
if you will multi-stall right fixtures
 
02:48:19.610 --> 02:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
02:48:25.490 --> 02:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
Therese Grinnell Loudon New Hampshire
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points I feel like every
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
human being really just wants to be
 
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
understood right and we all want to be
 
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
respected and we all want to be loved
 
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
for who we are so you've got two
 
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
opposing kind of perceptions on this
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
argument as the mother of an eight and a
 
02:48:52.130 --> 02:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
nine year old little boys I question
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
their maturity to know that oh now you
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
can go to whichever bathroom you want
 
02:48:58.969 --> 02:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
that they would do it and our teachers
 
02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be starting to manage
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior that's silly inappropriate body
 
02:49:07.490 --> 02:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
touch all of that nonsense right like I
 
02:49:09.050 --> 02:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
want my teachers to be teaching my boys
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
to read
 
02:49:13.130 --> 02:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I love this idea of a single use
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
stall available I think most schools
 
02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
have them at this point That Could Be
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
unisex if they don't I think we could
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
probably put something in place where
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know from
 
02:49:27.050 --> 02:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
you know the top of the hour to the half
 
02:49:29.210 --> 02:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
point of the hour is you know this
 
02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
particular bathroom is unisex but if the
 
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
females I guess my point is what we're
 
02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
doing if you take a step back as we're
 
02:49:38.690 --> 02:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
saying one person is saying I want to be
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
respected that based on how I feel my
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
gender is I want to be able to go to use
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
that gender's bathroom and then you have
 
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
others that are saying well
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
I want to use a bathroom that only
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
affiliates with my genitalia so how do
 
02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
we respect both groups
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
right without disparaging the other
 
02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:58.010 align:start position:0%
right without disparaging the other
group

02:49:58.010 --> 02:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
so we either go to the European style
 
02:50:01.969 --> 02:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
where everyone just goes wherever they
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to go and then we just kind of
 
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
change our culture which we've had here
 
02:50:09.889 --> 02:50:09.899 align:start position:0%
or we look at what are the ramifications
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
of that for like an eight and nine year
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
old again going in and thinking that
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
they can go and
 
02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know watch the girls and the girls
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
can play and now the teachers are in
 
02:50:19.490 --> 02:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
there having to tell everyone what's
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I think there's a lot of
 
02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
question here but I think there's some
 
02:50:26.210 --> 02:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
easy solutions and I think you know if
 
02:50:28.370 --> 02:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
we have the multi-stall bathrooms kind
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
of be generically just like the locker
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
rooms so you don't have people feeling
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that they're changing in
 
02:50:37.309 --> 02:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
front of the opposite sexual genitalia
 
02:50:39.469 --> 02:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
but then you also then have
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
accommodations for people who are
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
feeling as though they have male
 
02:50:46.429 --> 02:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
genitalia but they feel they affiliate
 
02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:47.660 align:start position:0%
with the female
 
02:50:50.570 --> 02:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
gender and vice versa that we have a
 
02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
space for them will that cost money it
 
02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
might but that's where our culture is
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
going and at the end of the day everyone
 
02:50:58.370 --> 02:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
needs to be respected and everyone needs
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be loved and everyone needs to be
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
understood and that's what I'm hearing
 
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
from both sides I would love to see a
 
02:51:05.809 --> 02:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
study done on how many of our public
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire have a
 
02:51:09.770 --> 02:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
multi-use bathroom because I believe
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
most of them do
 
02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
and so are we really creating a bunch of
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
division and media and what's going on
 
02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
in Milford and everyone getting upset
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
with each other or can we just come up
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
with a simple solution that respects
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
both perceptions
 
02:51:28.849 --> 02:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
and that's what I would recommend this
 
02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
group try to do thank you very much are
 
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
now see thank you very much
 
02:51:41.889 --> 02:51:41.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.730 --> 02:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
his position
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:51:59.570 --> 02:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
hi thank you Mr chair and committee
 
02:52:04.849 --> 02:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
members my name again is Louise fencer
 
02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm from Concord New Hampshire and today
 
02:52:09.769 --> 02:52:09.779 align:start position:0%
I am actually
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
um reading the testimony of Abby Maxwell
 
02:52:17.690 --> 02:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
who's a parent from Hopkinton New
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
02:52:23.210 --> 02:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and she writes dear members of the
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
House Education committee I am writing
 
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
to you to strongly oppose HB 104. my
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
daughter is 10 years old she loves to
 
02:52:34.490 --> 02:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
play the flute and cello to read to play
 
02:52:37.309 --> 02:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
Minecraft and to ski this year through
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
the school ski program she got to ski
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
with the school friend and her friend's
 
02:52:43.730 --> 02:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
father I thought they would go off alone
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
but the father asked me to join them he
 
02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
had a let's go Brandon sticker on his
 
02:52:51.410 --> 02:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
helmet and so I assumed that perhaps he
 
02:52:53.170 --> 02:52:53.180 align:start position:0%
viewed things differently than I did
 
02:52:56.450 --> 02:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
however I agreed to ski together we
 
02:52:58.610 --> 02:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
brought up the lift it turned out that
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
we had both grown up in the very same
 
02:53:02.929 --> 02:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
small New Hampshire town and we had both
 
02:53:05.389 --> 02:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
worked at the same ski area as teenagers
 
02:53:08.450 --> 02:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
he had graduated 10 years ahead of me
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
but we had many of the same teachers it
 
02:53:13.550 --> 02:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
was so fun to talk and laugh with him
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
about our school in town it was like we
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
had a deep shared understanding of each
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
other and where we came from in the
 
02:53:22.250 --> 02:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
world I skied with him and our daughters
 
02:53:23.929 --> 02:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
a few more times throughout the year and
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
I kept thinking about the experience did
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
he know my daughter was transgender of
 
02:53:31.490 --> 02:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
course there's no way to tell looking at
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
her but she is out at school and we
 
02:53:36.530 --> 02:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
publicly advocate for her rights year
 
02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
after year it's not hard to find out
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
what if he did know I don't know how
 
02:53:44.450 --> 02:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
this man votes or why though I can make
 
02:53:47.330 --> 02:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
some assumptions still I have to believe
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that if he knew about these bills if he
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
knew that this bill would require him to
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
look at my daughter and tell her that
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
she was not allowed to use the bathroom
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
he would never stand for it maybe he
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
would have in the past I don't know but
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
now he has been forced to see our shared
 
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
Humanity he has held my daughter's hand
 
02:54:08.510 --> 02:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
and helped her to stand up on the ski
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
Trail he has asked her if her leg hurt
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
if her hands were too cold he has cared
 
02:54:16.130 --> 02:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
for her which means he knows how utterly
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
cruel and senseless it would be to tell
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
her that she cannot go to the girls
 
02:54:20.399 --> 02:54:21.710 align:start position:0%
her that she cannot go to the girls
bathroom

02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is my third year in a row fighting
 
02:54:27.710 --> 02:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
these bills my husband and I are so
 
02:54:30.889 --> 02:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
tired we are working so hard to protect
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
our sleep and our mental health and
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
these assaults so that we can still give
 
02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
our daughter a good happy childhood it's
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
not easy we love our home yet with every
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
one of these bills we wonder when we
 
02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
will have to leave
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
obviously we cannot live in a state
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
where our daughter is ostracized for who
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
she comes to the world as I have to
 
02:54:55.010 --> 02:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
believe it is not your aim to harm
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
children and families in this way I pray
 
02:55:01.610 --> 02:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
that you recognize our shared humanity
 
02:55:04.429 --> 02:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
and stop these bills thank you Abby
 
02:55:04.439 --> 02:55:05.469 align:start position:0%
and stop these bills thank you Abby

Maxwell
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%

02:55:12.050 --> 02:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay very good are you getting questions
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
02:55:16.250 --> 02:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
Belcher yes
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
that testimony
 
02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
um you had said that you were
 
02:55:24.590 --> 02:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
um reading this testimony from uh
 
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
somebody you know and I receive the same
 
02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:29.090 align:start position:0%
somebody you know and I receive the same
testimony

02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
in my email I did read it because I do
 
02:55:33.170 --> 02:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
try to keep up with testimony that comes
 
02:55:35.450 --> 02:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
in but I was curious because I heard you
 
02:55:37.969 --> 02:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
say something different he said he had a
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
let's go Brandon's sticker on his helmet
 
02:55:41.809 --> 02:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
I assume that he meant that he voted for
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
laws that harm my child I don't believe
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's what you had said I'm wondering
 
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
did you modify the testimony at all or
 
02:55:50.210 --> 02:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
was it I didn't intentionally modify the
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
testimony so I was just curious that
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't my intention so let me look here
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
if I did that it was unintentional thank
 
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
you very much yeah okay any further
 
02:56:02.809 --> 02:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for the correction
 
02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you thank you uh
 
02:56:14.090 --> 02:56:14.100 align:start position:0%

yeah I'm gonna see that cards right
 
02:56:32.230 --> 02:56:32.240 align:start position:0%

percent of transgender individuals

02:58:12.650 --> 02:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
large to be very accepting
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
this bill could only serve to further
 
02:58:16.730 --> 02:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
restrict access to affirming spaces for
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
Trans youth School a crucial and
 
02:58:20.750 --> 02:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
developmental everyday environment would
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
become a place where a child can no
 
02:58:23.809 --> 02:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
longer Fully live in accordance with
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
their identity
 
02:58:26.450 --> 02:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
where these numbers of affirming
 
02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
environments decreases we expect anxiety
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide will likely
 
02:58:30.960 --> 02:58:33.230 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide will likely
increase

02:58:33.230 --> 02:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:34.250 --> 02:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to recommend
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
inexpeding to legislate for HP 104.

um
 
02:58:46.429 --> 02:58:46.439 align:start position:0%

02:58:48.650 --> 02:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
mental health and high risk for suicide
 
02:58:48.660 --> 02:58:49.550 align:start position:0%
mental health and high risk for suicide

but
 
02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
um your statistic that 39 of lgbtq Youth
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
um seriously consider suicide do we have
 
02:59:01.210 --> 02:59:01.220 align:start position:0%
a percentage of Youth who are lgbtq
 
02:59:03.530 --> 02:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
because this would be a percentage of a
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
percentage yes thank you for that
 
02:59:06.530 --> 02:59:06.540 align:start position:0%

um I wanted to ask you
 
02:59:19.010 --> 02:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
you you uh suggested that these
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
affirming spaces would be very important
 
02:59:24.290 --> 02:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
toward reducing harms to transgender
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
youth would you agree that parental
 
02:59:30.410 --> 02:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
involvement is also an extremely
 
02:59:30.420 --> 02:59:32.630 align:start position:0%
involvement is also an extremely
important

02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
item in in that parental involvement in
 
02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
their lives and and what's going on with
 
02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:38.030 align:start position:0%
their lives and and what's going on with
them

02:59:38.030 --> 02:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I would
 
02:59:41.929 --> 02:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
believe that uh supportive parenting is
 
02:59:43.130 --> 02:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to transgender
 
02:59:45.889 --> 02:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
children as seen by the grv study uh
 
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
emotional familial neglect impact
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
suicidality thank you I and the reason I
 
02:59:51.889 --> 02:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
asked that is because when I go to the
 
02:59:53.630 --> 02:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
Trevor Project website the very first
 
02:59:55.130 --> 02:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
thing that comes up
 
02:59:58.130 --> 02:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
is an indicator that says to anybody
 
03:00:00.410 --> 03:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
visiting his website click here to
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
quickly scrub your history and get out
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
of this website so your parents can't
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
see you're on this website I'm wondering
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
if this is something that is not meshing
 
03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up uh I mean I
 
03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
believe that I I said that uh
 
03:00:21.769 --> 03:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
it is the familial neglect that is
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
harming these children these children
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
who would not want these their parents
 
03:00:27.290 --> 03:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
to see them accessing the site are the
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
parents that are neglecting them
 
03:00:31.969 --> 03:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the questions
 
03:00:34.010 --> 03:00:34.020 align:start position:0%

03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning my name is
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
Lily and I'm a junior at Plymouth
 
03:00:49.610 --> 03:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
Regional High School in Plymouth and I'm
 
03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition to HB 104.
 
03:00:54.290 --> 03:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
I have attended New Hampshire public
 
03:00:56.330 --> 03:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
schools for my entire educational career
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
I've also played and participated in a
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
number of sports where we do in fact use
 
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
the locker rooms I can say with the
 
03:01:03.950 --> 03:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
utmost certainty that I have never
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
wished the bathrooms or locker rooms to
 
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
be mandated as same-sex
 
03:01:09.710 --> 03:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
growing up in a world of advancing
 
03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
technology where practically any
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
information is at the touch of my
 
03:01:14.570 --> 03:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
fingertips I've grown accustomed to
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
learning and hearing about current
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
events immediately as they arise
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
likewise I've heard of countless pieces
 
03:01:21.889 --> 03:01:21.899 align:start position:0%
of policy and legislation like this one
 
03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
requiring same-sex bathrooms and locker
 
03:01:25.610 --> 03:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
rooms in schools of messaging that
 
03:01:27.230 --> 03:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
typically Falls along the lines of
 
03:01:29.929 --> 03:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
protecting our children I ask this which
 
03:01:31.849 --> 03:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
children are we protecting and who are
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
we protecting from most students like
 
03:01:35.809 --> 03:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
myself give no attention to their peers
 
03:01:37.550 --> 03:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the bathroom or locker rooms and
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
instead go about minding their own
 
03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
business in fact the protection children
 
03:01:43.370 --> 03:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
need while at school lies far from being
 
03:01:45.950 --> 03:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
found inside the bathrooms there are
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
however a number of people that would
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit from maintaining neutral
 
03:01:51.230 --> 03:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
bathrooms transgender and non-binary
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that face discrimination and
 
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in their day-to-day lives find
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
relief in neutral bathrooms that allow
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
them to use the restroom in peace
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
outlining a separation like this bill
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
intends to do forces these students and
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
faculty to unwillingly put themselves in
 
03:02:05.809 --> 03:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
a situation that may cause them
 
03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
increased dysphoria or anxiety
 
03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
school should be a place where all
 
03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
students and staff no matter their
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
identity feel safe and accepted it
 
03:02:15.170 --> 03:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
should not be a place where something as
 
03:02:16.490 --> 03:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
simple as going to the bathroom is
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
mandated and separated based on sex
 
03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
where they feel unsafe and unwanted in a
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
place of privacy my transgender friends
 
03:02:24.050 --> 03:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
simply want access to a bathroom that
 
03:02:25.849 --> 03:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
affirms their identity transgender
 
03:02:27.410 --> 03:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
students and staff using bathrooms that
 
03:02:28.969 --> 03:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
affirm their gender are not threats to
 
03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
Public Safety they are not dangerous and
 
03:02:33.230 --> 03:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
should not be dehumanized by the subject
 
03:02:34.670 --> 03:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
of bathroom debate
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
I have never felt uncomfortable or
 
03:02:38.090 --> 03:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
unsafe sharing a locker room with my
 
03:02:40.490 --> 03:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
transgender peers I have however felt
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly unsafe sharing a space with
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
people who push a hateful narrative
 
03:02:45.530 --> 03:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
against their transgender peers hidden
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
behind claims of safety when it's
 
03:02:48.530 --> 03:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
stemmed from a place of hatred and
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
refusal of acceptance take a moment to
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
listen to your students who are here
 
03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
today telling you what we want someone
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
else's identity does not affect you and
 
03:02:58.429 --> 03:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
it certainly does not affect you in the
 
03:03:00.050 --> 03:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
bathroom or locker room places where
 
03:03:01.849 --> 03:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
personal privacy are at its highest
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
where someone chooses to use the
 
03:03:05.090 --> 03:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
facilities in a school should not be a
 
03:03:06.769 --> 03:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion which is why
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
important implore you to oppose hb104 we
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
should be acting in favor of all
 
03:03:12.889 --> 03:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
students no matter their identity to
 
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
ensure that their schools are a place
 
03:03:16.130 --> 03:03:16.140 align:start position:0%

only worsen what are often difficult

circumstances for Trans young people I'm
 
03:04:37.849 --> 03:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
currently in high school and can say
 
03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
that I've never once walked into a
 
03:04:40.490 --> 03:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
school bathroom and wondered if every
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
person who has the same Parts as me
 
03:04:44.450 --> 03:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't matter bodies are
 
03:04:45.889 --> 03:04:45.899 align:start position:0%
bodies and where that body chooses to
 
03:04:47.450 --> 03:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom has zero effect on me
 
03:04:49.490 --> 03:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
if anything I want my peers to be able
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
to use the bathroom that feels the best
 
03:04:52.490 --> 03:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
of them so they can focus on school and
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
friends and not worry about where
 
03:04:55.969 --> 03:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
they're going to relieve themselves
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't protect anyone
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
all it does is feed into the anti-trans
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%

go to or the one they want to go to it
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
results in a lot of them just not going

03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
when they're able to live according to
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
their preferred gender identity
 
03:10:01.250 --> 03:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and this bill would prohibit their
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
ability to do so
 
03:10:04.969 --> 03:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
um I think we all envision a New
 
03:10:07.490 --> 03:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where our children are able to
 
03:10:10.370 --> 03:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
freely Express themselves live in safety
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
and uh thrive in an environment that
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
caters to their well-being
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
and live without the burdens of their
 
03:10:18.110 --> 03:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
03:10:20.389 --> 03:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
however in just the past year as you
 
03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:22.220 align:start position:0%
heard from many other folks
 
03:10:25.090 --> 03:10:25.100 align:start position:0%
lgbtq youth especially have been
 
03:10:27.170 --> 03:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
suffering from severe mental health
 
03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
suffering from severe mental health
complications

03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
complications
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh many have seriously considered
 
03:10:32.880 --> 03:10:33.950 align:start position:0%
uh many have seriously considered
suicide

03:10:33.950 --> 03:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
these statistics are Stark reminders
 
03:10:39.170 --> 03:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we as a state can do better for our
 
03:10:39.180 --> 03:10:41.269 align:start position:0%
that we as a state can do better for our
children

03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 104 is in direct
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
opposition to this shared goal of
 
03:10:47.090 --> 03:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
creating a safe space for our children
 
03:10:51.889 --> 03:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
and encouraging and proper Mental Health
 
03:10:53.630 --> 03:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
um when children are able to socially
 
03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
um when children are able to socially
transition

03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
transition
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and live to their lives as their
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
preferred gender their mental health
 
03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
outcomes are on par with children who
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't identify as lgbtqia Plus
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
um something as simple as affirming
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
their gender identities with allowing
 
03:11:10.849 --> 03:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
them to use the bathroom of their choice
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
um has been shown to improve mental
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
health so this bill we would ask that
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
you oppose it as just a clear reminder
 
03:11:20.990 --> 03:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
to everyone that we stand in support of
 
03:11:24.010 --> 03:11:24.020 align:start position:0%
our children's mental health and we are
 
03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
supportive in an affirming state for all
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
children thank you very much for your
 
03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions from
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:11:35.090 --> 03:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
now see any thank you very much
 
03:11:52.510 --> 03:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.889 --> 03:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is David
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
Trumbull I'm from where I posed this
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill for three reasons first is that
 
03:12:02.269 --> 03:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
transgender rights and safety can
 
03:12:05.090 --> 03:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
co-exist there's a report that was put
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
out by four groups including the
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
transgender center for the national
 
03:12:11.330 --> 03:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
Center for transgender equality that
 
03:12:15.349 --> 03:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
addressed this this very specific topic
 
03:12:18.230 --> 03:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
it says non-discrimination laws that
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly protect lgbtq people have
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
been enacted in 19 States and more than
 
03:12:25.969 --> 03:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
200 municipalities with no increase in
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
public safety incidents and this the
 
03:12:29.650 --> 03:12:29.660 align:start position:0%
report is called bathroom safety
 
03:12:31.849 --> 03:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws and bathroom ban
 
03:12:33.830 --> 03:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
laws so you can accomplish both
 
03:12:36.530 --> 03:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
objectives you can have access to
 
03:12:38.570 --> 03:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
bathrooms for transgender people and
 
03:12:41.230 --> 03:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
Public Safety second is human rights
 
03:12:44.510 --> 03:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
lgbtq rights should be considered as
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
just basic human rights transgender
 
03:12:49.610 --> 03:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
people need to use the bathroom like
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
everybody else and should not be shamed
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
into not being able to go to the
 
03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
bathroom so an entire day of school you
 
03:12:58.250 --> 03:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
might wonder how many people were
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
talking about the UCLA School of Law
 
03:13:03.889 --> 03:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
Williams Institute this past year in
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
2022 said that there are 1.6 million
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
people who identify as transgender in
 
03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
the United States that's more people
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
than the entire State of New Hampshire
 
03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
they say that 1.4 four percent of people
 
03:13:19.969 --> 03:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
age 13 to 17 identify as transgender and
 
03:13:21.530 --> 03:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's not even counting non-binary
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
people this study says that in New
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just identified openly there's
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
over 700 students between the ages of 13
 
03:13:31.370 --> 03:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
and 17 and obviously there's many more
 
03:13:33.050 --> 03:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
who don't answer yes to these questions
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
so 700 students just to remind you when
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
we debated the EFA accounts there's
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
three thousand of those 25 percent of
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
them were brand new people going from a
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
public school to a private school that's
 
03:13:49.130 --> 03:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
700 people so all the discussion on efas
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
was for about 700 people we're talking
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
about 700 students at least who can't
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
use a bath if you pass this kind of Bill
 
03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
would have a hard time using the
 
03:13:59.450 --> 03:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
bathroom of their choice rather than
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
their sexual identification at Birth the
 
03:14:04.490 --> 03:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
third thing is
 
03:14:07.550 --> 03:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
the law educates you have a choice to
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
either pass a law that's based on fear
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
and lack of acceptance or you have a
 
03:14:15.290 --> 03:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
chance to Pace pass a law that's based
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
upon tolerance and understanding in
 
03:14:20.929 --> 03:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
human rights the law speaks volumes to
 
03:14:22.969 --> 03:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
the people of the state and if you pass
 
03:14:25.370 --> 03:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
this law you're telling people be afraid
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
of transgender people even though the
 
03:14:29.570 --> 03:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
original sponsor said he didn't mean it
 
03:14:32.330 --> 03:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
to feel that way that's going to be the
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
way the law will be perceived by people
 
03:14:36.889 --> 03:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
and that will just put back the March
 
03:14:39.050 --> 03:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
towards progress for everybody to be
 
03:14:41.330 --> 03:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
treated equally in our society and the
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you got from the gentleman
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
who's in with the building code said
 
03:14:47.210 --> 03:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
they're coming up with a new code that's
 
03:14:52.010 --> 03:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
going to work on multi-stall uh neutral
 
03:14:54.050 --> 03:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
bathrooms this bill would clearly
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
preclude that from happening in the
 
03:14:57.230 --> 03:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
schools and the questioners have pointed
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%

03:15:00.769 --> 03:15:00.779 align:start position:0%

myself here I just want to share a quick
 
03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:36.769 align:start position:0%
myself here I just want to share a quick
story

03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:15:38.330 --> 03:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
um that my wife reminded me up you're
 
03:15:39.469 --> 03:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
gonna you probably hear me talk about
 
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
her quite a bit when I get up here she's
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
a high school teacher at the end of last
 
03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:44.150 align:start position:0%
a high school teacher at the end of last
year

03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:15:47.210 --> 03:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
um a transgender girl went and used the
 
03:15:48.410 --> 03:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
boys bathroom because it was the
 
03:15:49.849 --> 03:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
bathroom she felt of least resistance
 
03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
within the school to be able to use two
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
boys dumped buckets of water on her head
 
03:16:00.050 --> 03:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
and used homophobic slurs against her
 
03:16:02.450 --> 03:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
inside the school inside of the bathroom
 
03:16:04.670 --> 03:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill would mandate that she
 
03:16:06.610 --> 03:16:06.620 align:start position:0%
continues to use
 
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
for Trans students it can be
 
03:16:13.490 --> 03:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
as we've heard just a terrifying to have
 
03:16:14.809 --> 03:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
to use the bathroom that you don't feel
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable in this story breaks my
 
03:16:16.439 --> 03:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
comfortable in this story breaks my
heart

03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
heart
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
um as my wife tells it to me she knew
 
03:16:21.889 --> 03:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
the student and taught this student so
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
just wanted to tell you a story that
 
03:16:23.819 --> 03:16:24.830 align:start position:0%
just wanted to tell you a story that
happened

03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
six months ago of a student here in New
 
03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who faced just a horrible
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
situation because she used the bathroom
 
03:16:36.230 --> 03:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
um that she again felt was the one the
 
03:16:37.730 --> 03:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
school wants her to use this bathroom of
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
sort of least resistance for her happy
 
03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Lakers
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:52.130 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:16:52.130 --> 03:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
um a school having single stall
 
03:16:59.210 --> 03:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
genderless bathrooms solve the problem
 
03:17:05.450 --> 03:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
obviously being a CIS male and without
 
03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
being a trans person myself it's a hard
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
question for me to answer only to say
 
03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
that we should be welcoming people as to
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
who they are and shouldn't be putting
 
03:17:18.230 --> 03:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
them into different places because they
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
we perceive them to be different and so
 
03:17:22.670 --> 03:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
I think what we should be doing is
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
looking to welcome everyone as who they
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
are and that's the best case scenario
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
 
03:17:29.520 --> 03:17:30.469 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
committee

03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and ah thank you for
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony my name is Sarah
 
03:17:51.600 --> 03:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony my name is Sarah
Smith

03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
03:17:56.510 --> 03:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and I I post this uh bill and I have
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
three things to say about it
 
03:17:58.680 --> 03:17:59.450 align:start position:0%
three things to say about it
um

03:17:59.450 --> 03:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh first of all uh the the bill says
 
03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:05.090 align:start position:0%
uh first of all uh the the bill says
that

03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:05.100 --> 03:18:05.950 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the end that shall be same-sex but
 
03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
the bill never defines sex and so it's
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
deliberately vague
 
03:18:23.330 --> 03:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
um so if I Define sex I say well okay so
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
somebody's sex identified on their
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
driver's license on their birth
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
certificate and how they have identified
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
that that would be how I would interpret
 
03:18:36.530 --> 03:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
same-sex but I hear people here
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
interpreting same sex purely on the
 
03:18:43.010 --> 03:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
biological birth of the of the
 
03:18:43.020 --> 03:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
biological birth of the of the
individual

03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:18:47.330 --> 03:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so this is deliberately vague
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
um as as a and that's a problem right
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
there how do you how do you interpret
 
03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:54.050 align:start position:0%
there how do you how do you interpret
that

03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:54.060 --> 03:18:54.910 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:18:54.910 --> 03:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:00.769 --> 03:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
and uh you know also erases and intersex
 
03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
people or non-binary people
 
03:19:07.070 --> 03:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I was struck by the testimony of
 
03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
um I was struck by the testimony of
about

03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:19:10.929 --> 03:19:10.939 align:start position:0%
um often as as the previous gentleman
 
03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
mentioned based on fear
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
um of women uh expressing fear about
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
what something that their privacy in the
 
03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:23.389 align:start position:0%
what something that their privacy in the
bathroom

03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and I wanted to share a little
 
03:19:26.990 --> 03:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
incident with you to put in a different
 
03:19:29.450 --> 03:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
kind of perspective I'm a retired school
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
teacher and
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh we had a problem for a while against
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
taking kids a long time to go to the
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom and uh one of our bathrooms was
 
03:19:44.210 --> 03:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
it's an old school and you know they've
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
been remodeled badly a long time ago but
 
03:19:49.130 --> 03:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
we never had any money to fix it so
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
there were really some huge gaps between
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
the door and this and the side of the
 
03:19:59.150 --> 03:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
stall and yeah you could see in and the
 
03:20:02.150 --> 03:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
girls we were embarrassed by that just
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
by the fact of other girls being able to
 
03:20:06.889 --> 03:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
look in and they refused to use that
 
03:20:08.809 --> 03:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
stall so it would take a long time to go
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
to the bathroom because they they were
 
03:20:14.090 --> 03:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
only two other stalls to use so this
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
this is not an issue about whether it's
 
03:20:19.969 --> 03:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh there's a a transgender individual or
 
03:20:22.130 --> 03:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
anything there was an issue because
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
there was not enough privacy between
 
03:20:27.290 --> 03:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
girls and this is to me is what this
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
issue is talking about now I'm in favor
 
03:20:33.050 --> 03:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
of the So eventually it
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
um people you know were like oh this is
 
03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
ridiculous finally they came along and
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
said well we'll just put another we're
 
03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
just going to fix this door we'll put a
 
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
little strip there so there's not a gap
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that was it that was it that was the
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
problem so uh and I and I see this in a
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
lot of bathrooms now that are you know
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
fully doored and completely private
 
03:20:56.450 --> 03:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
um that's the issue that we're talking
 
03:20:59.090 --> 03:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
about we're trying to ban a certain
 
03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
class of people
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
to fix an issue that is not of their
 
03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
making and
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
and we're also trying to ban People
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
based on behavior that we don't very
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any questions
 
03:21:16.849 --> 03:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
that testimony I have I have some degree
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
of familiarity with the background on
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
the concept of gender as a social
 
03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
construct going back to youth Butler I
 
03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've ever heard anyone
 
03:21:33.889 --> 03:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
argue that sex itself is a social
 
03:21:36.290 --> 03:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
construct or that can be changed or is
 
03:21:39.050 --> 03:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
not firm and it seemed like you were
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that sex was a vague
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
term can you can you elaborate on that
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I would say yes that the term sex
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
refers to a number of characteristics
 
03:21:51.889 --> 03:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a physician I can't
 
03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
elaborate on them I could get you a
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
better elaboration of that but there are
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
a number of characteristics that
 
03:22:00.230 --> 03:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
determine sex and sometimes it is not
 
03:22:02.090 --> 03:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
easy to determine sex based on those
 
03:22:04.610 --> 03:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
characteristics so
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so that is a really deep question
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
that needs to be gone into because uh
 
03:22:14.929 --> 03:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
uh it is not it's not a question of of
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh genitalia for instance or chromosomes
 
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of different ways
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
that people present themselves
 
03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and so if you if you want to you need
 
03:22:28.969 --> 03:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
to develop a background in some of the
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
the medical issues that that come up I
 
03:22:34.429 --> 03:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
could have
 
03:22:34.439 --> 03:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
could have
um

03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:36.769 --> 03:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
you could have someone I know who's a
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
physician who could explain to you the
 
03:22:41.690 --> 03:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
different ways that sex are determined
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon my name is
 
03:23:03.410 --> 03:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
Diana George
 
03:23:05.150 --> 03:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
um I oppose this bill
 
03:23:06.830 --> 03:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have a written testimony because
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning on testifying today
 
03:23:10.490 --> 03:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
however I'm a mother
 
03:23:13.729 --> 03:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
parent of a transgender 22 year old who
 
03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
came out at age 15.
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't we had no idea my husband and
 
03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
I but we chose to support and love our
 
03:23:22.500 --> 03:23:23.690 align:start position:0%
I but we chose to support and love our
child

03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
as any parent should
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
and he is thriving he's a student and
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
he looks
 
03:23:37.250 --> 03:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
so there would be it would be very
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
awkward for him to be using
 
03:23:45.050 --> 03:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
a female
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
or yes female gender bathroom
 
03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I think that that also needs to be
 
03:23:53.690 --> 03:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:56.929 --> 03:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
yeah and what this other woman just said
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are intersex people
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
there are people with XX chromosomes who
 
03:24:04.190 --> 03:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
look male
 
03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.180 --> 03:24:10.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:10.739 --> 03:24:12.889 align:start position:0%
um
also

03:24:12.889 --> 03:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
if a man I work at the women's prison
 
03:24:18.650 --> 03:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
if a man wants to get into a bathroom to
 
03:24:22.610 --> 03:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
rape you they're not going to pretend to
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
be a transgender person that's just
 
03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:28.010 align:start position:0%
be a transgender person that's just
silly

03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.020 --> 03:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just so tired of these of these
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory bills it's it's just so
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
exhausting for the trans people and for
 
03:24:40.849 --> 03:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
03:24:42.530 --> 03:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
and this is going on all around the
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
country it's a huge attack on us as
 
03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
families as we're good people we're
 
03:24:51.650 --> 03:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.660 --> 03:24:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:57.239 --> 03:25:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
also by using a single stall bathroom a
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
separate bathroom for Trans
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
and non-binary people it's it's a form
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
of outing them
 
03:25:17.210 --> 03:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
if they happen to pass
 
03:25:19.969 --> 03:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
as they say going to that bathroom
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
because they're forced to makes other
 
03:25:24.290 --> 03:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
people know that they are Transit and
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
they may not want people to know that
 
03:25:28.490 --> 03:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
they may not want their parents to know
 
03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:29.210 align:start position:0%
they may not want their parents to know
that

03:25:29.210 --> 03:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
because their parents may be
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
abusive and not supportive
 
03:25:36.530 --> 03:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
so please consider all of this when
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about this bill and
 
03:25:39.290 --> 03:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
considering this bill
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for coming
 
03:25:43.130 --> 03:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
today are there further questions from
 
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:49.680 --> 03:25:52.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:25:52.450 --> 03:25:52.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:03.889 --> 03:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Lane
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
I am like any other teenager I enjoy
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
hanging out with friends and family I
 
03:26:13.969 --> 03:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
study hard so I can do well in school I
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
love playing soccer skiing hiking I also
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
happen to be a transgender girl
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
being trans has been a lifelong journey
 
03:26:23.690 --> 03:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
as soon as I could talk I literally told
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
my parents I am a girl my brain did not
 
03:26:28.250 --> 03:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
align with my body parts and that's just
 
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
the way I was born
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been easy for me
 
03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but when I socially transitioned at
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the end of fifth grade it was the best
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
day of my life because I could finally
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
be myself
 
03:26:41.690 --> 03:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
I'm so grateful for the level of support
 
03:26:43.969 --> 03:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
that I have received and it's made me
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
the proud trans girl that stands before
 
03:26:48.650 --> 03:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
I use a ghost bathroom in locker rooms
 
03:26:52.490 --> 03:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
without an issue no one has ever made me
 
03:26:55.130 --> 03:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable nor have I ever made
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
others feel that way everyone values
 
03:26:57.960 --> 03:26:58.969 align:start position:0%
others feel that way everyone values
privacy

03:26:58.969 --> 03:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:27:01.790 --> 03:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
to suggest that somehow we are a threat
 
03:27:04.090 --> 03:27:04.100 align:start position:0%
is not factual end it is fear-mongering
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
trans kids are kids we're students who
 
03:27:08.809 --> 03:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
want to be able to go to the bathroom
 
03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
like anyone else
 
03:27:12.769 --> 03:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
using a bathroom using a bathroom
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
comfortably is a key part of thriving in
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
a school environment
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
and singling out trans kids by
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
preventing us from using these bathrooms
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
is not fair
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
please have some compassion
 
03:27:26.450 --> 03:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
send this bill and others like it have
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
been brought forward it's clear that my
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
mere existence makes some people feel
 
03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:31.309 align:start position:0%
mere existence makes some people feel
uncomfortable

03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
03:27:33.410 --> 03:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I can do about that
 
03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
however I will say that one person's
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
discomfort should not Trump another
 
03:27:40.969 --> 03:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
person's civil rights in this case the
 
03:27:42.410 --> 03:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
ability to learn in a safe environment
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
or to be able to participate with
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
everyone else without being singled out
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
please do not attack Trends youth I'm
 
03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
missing school today to be here because
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that you see that
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
we are people just like you who deserve
 
03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
to be a hath who deserve to be healthy
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%

a lot of litigation and legislative work
here

03:28:37.490 --> 03:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:40.490 --> 03:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
um today's transgender students are our
 
03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
future neighbors co-workers teachers
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
leaders our parents and friends we need
 
03:28:48.050 --> 03:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
them we need them and all other young
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
people to be really successful adults
 
03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's why we provide public education
 
03:28:53.450 --> 03:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
in the first place these young people
 
03:28:55.610 --> 03:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
are integral to our community and
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to equal educational
 
03:29:00.170 --> 03:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities this bill doesn't say what
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsor says it says there's no
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
mention of chromosomes or genitalia in
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill at all a bathroom
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a facility and a bathroom doesn't
 
03:29:10.250 --> 03:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
have a sex or a gender the intent behind
 
03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
this bill according to the prime
 
03:29:13.729 --> 03:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
sponsor's testimony is for this
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee to vote on a bill about people
 
03:29:18.290 --> 03:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
in other words it's about excluding
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
certain people from facilities uh and as
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
the building expert testified this bill
 
03:29:26.090 --> 03:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
is not the right vehicle for excluding
 
03:29:27.889 --> 03:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
people from facilities
 
03:29:29.809 --> 03:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh the building conflict with New
 
03:29:31.849 --> 03:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State and and federal
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws which prohibit
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex
 
03:29:39.170 --> 03:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
gender identity and transgender status
 
03:29:39.180 --> 03:29:40.070 align:start position:0%
gender identity and transgender status
um

03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's also a violation of the guarantee
 
03:29:44.090 --> 03:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the state and federal constitutions
 
03:29:46.610 --> 03:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
which guarantee equal protection on of
 
03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
the laws by singling out transgender
 
03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
students and treating them differently
 
03:29:51.650 --> 03:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
from other students this bill is
 
03:29:54.410 --> 03:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
unlawful and unconstitutional
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
many courts have addressed where um kind
 
03:29:59.090 --> 03:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
of address cases where a transgender
 
03:30:00.889 --> 03:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
student was excluded from them using the
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
bathroom of their gender Gavin Grimm for
 
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
instance was a transgender boy who used
 
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
the boys bathroom in his high school
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
without a problem until a small group of
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
parents complained Gavin's School
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
buckled under pressure from this
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
minority number of parents after a long
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
legal battle that lasted many years the
 
03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
federal court of appeals for the fourth
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
circuit ruled in favor of Gavin's right
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
to use the restroom and Gloucester
 
03:30:24.769 --> 03:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
County School District in Virginia had
 
03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
to pay 1.3 million dollars this is one
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
of many cases that have come out of uh
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
come up the same way costing school
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
districts Nationwide millions of dollars
 
03:30:36.830 --> 03:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
with one outlier case from the 11th
 
03:30:39.170 --> 03:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
circuit going the other direction Gavin
 
03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
was not a threat to any other student
 
03:30:42.530 --> 03:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
he's a kid who needed to use the
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
bathroom at school just like any other
 
03:30:46.429 --> 03:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
kid and when a transgender boy like
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
Gavin goes through every aspect of his
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
life as a boy he's not going to fit in
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
where he's when he's in the boys
 
03:30:53.570 --> 03:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
bathroom he's going to feel the
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
isolating stigma
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
um if he's forced to use a single user
 
03:30:59.570 --> 03:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
restroom against as well of course that
 
03:31:01.130 --> 03:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
option of a single user restroom should
 
03:31:02.929 --> 03:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
be available to any student who wants to
 
03:31:04.729 --> 03:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
use a single user restroom and I really
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
do applaud school districts for building
 
03:31:07.729 --> 03:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
more of them to provide students with
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
more options to make them comfortable
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
but a sense of belonging is something
 
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
that can't be denied to any student
 
03:31:15.170 --> 03:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
based on a core aspect of that person's
 
03:31:17.690 --> 03:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
identity it's unlawful and it's cruel to
 
03:31:19.729 --> 03:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
exclude transgender students from using
 
03:31:22.809 --> 03:31:22.819 align:start position:0%
the restroom like anyone else
 
03:31:25.729 --> 03:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
very much does the judge cut you off
 
03:31:31.250 --> 03:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
like that too no they typically now are
 
03:31:32.570 --> 03:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
you very much for uh for joining us this
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon Chris could you talk with us a
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
little bit um about
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
um maybe uh instances of violence that
 
03:31:48.769 --> 03:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
may have occurred between or when when a
 
03:31:52.010 --> 03:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
trans student is using a restroom that
 
03:31:55.010 --> 03:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
that doesn't conform to their to their
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
um to their Identity or their preference
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
um their identity and also instance of
 
03:32:05.570 --> 03:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
violence that may have been reported as
 
03:32:09.530 --> 03:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
a result of um of of trans-inclusive uh
 
03:32:11.330 --> 03:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
policy that's a really good question and
 
03:32:12.769 --> 03:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking our repellent out
 
03:32:16.429 --> 03:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
so um in 2018 there was a first study
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
that was released ever to my knowledge
 
03:32:18.960 --> 03:32:20.090 align:start position:0%
that was released ever to my knowledge
about

03:32:20.090 --> 03:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
um and you know studying whether there's
 
03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
been any increase
 
03:32:26.269 --> 03:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
um in instances of violence in restrooms
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh related to a change in bathroom
 
03:32:32.570 --> 03:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
policy and that was a study done in
 
03:32:34.250 --> 03:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and it showed that there
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
was no increase in any incidence of
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
violence against anybody in bathrooms as
 
03:32:40.130 --> 03:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
a result of the existence as a result of
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the presence of transgender people or
 
03:32:44.330 --> 03:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
the right of transgender people to be uh
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
to use the bathroom consistent with
 
03:32:47.570 --> 03:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
their gender identity and so um since
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
then there have been other studies that
 
03:32:51.229 --> 03:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
have come to the same conclusion there's
 
03:32:53.090 --> 03:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
no evidence that there's any increase in
 
03:32:55.130 --> 03:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
any risk of violence as a result of
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
policies that allow people to use the
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
restroom consistent with their gender
 
03:33:00.849 --> 03:33:00.859 align:start position:0%
identity so that answer your question
 
03:33:03.550 --> 03:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Belcher
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to follow up on
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
that question
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and he spoke to as far as studies go
 
03:33:12.769 --> 03:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
as far as rates but are you aware of any
 
03:33:12.779 --> 03:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
as far as rates but are you aware of any
incidents

03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm not up on all the incidents that
 
03:33:18.650 --> 03:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
might have happened that involved
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
transgender people or non-transgender
 
03:33:22.190 --> 03:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
people over the many years right
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um before there was ever an issue of uh
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
transgender people you know using
 
03:33:29.090 --> 03:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
bathrooms in public spaces because there
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't high levels of transgender
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
visibility in the past uh there were
 
03:33:34.610 --> 03:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
incidents where uh where people would
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
would perpetrate violence against people
 
03:33:38.510 --> 03:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the same sex or people of the of a
 
03:33:40.010 --> 03:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
different sex in bathrooms so it's
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
always been the case it's always been
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
true it continues to happen to this day
 
03:33:45.050 --> 03:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
I have no doubt uh and there's been no
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
increase in incidents of it so
 
03:33:48.889 --> 03:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
um you know if you want to talk about
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotal incidents of violence um you
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm not the right person to be
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
asking that question thank you thank you
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
is there
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
are there many instances of transgender
 
03:34:08.690 --> 03:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
people or of non-transgender people
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
pretending to be transgender people
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
committing assault
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question I'm not
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with any incidents where a
 
03:34:19.130 --> 03:34:19.140 align:start position:0%
person has pretended to be transgender
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of uh assaulting
 
03:34:23.090 --> 03:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
somebody in a bathroom but I will add
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
that it is possible just like it's
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
possible for a non-transgender person it
 
03:34:28.729 --> 03:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
is possible for a transgender person to
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
commit an act of violence that's you
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
know that is an inevitability of life
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
that there are people who will commit
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
acts of violence and it's super
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
important to keep our bathrooms safe in
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools nobody should be
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
questioning that that is absolutely a
 
03:34:43.130 --> 03:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
number one priority but what we know
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
from the research that's been done is
 
03:34:46.370 --> 03:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
that the existence of or the presence of
 
03:34:48.050 --> 03:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
transgender people does not change the
 
03:34:49.370 --> 03:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
rates of violence in those in those
 
03:34:49.380 --> 03:34:50.510 align:start position:0%
rates of violence in those in those
spaces

03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
03:34:52.490 --> 03:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you thank
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you know
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
of any cases in New Hampshire that have
 
03:35:02.830 --> 03:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
been filed that prohibit or limit
 
03:35:05.809 --> 03:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
transgender students from using uh the
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
bathroom of their choice
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
um as of right now I have not heard of
 
03:35:11.929 --> 03:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
any any schools that are excluding
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
transgender people from using the
 
03:35:15.769 --> 03:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
bathroom and if I did I would want to
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
know more about it because I would
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
consider I would consider you know um
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
working with with a family who is
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
affected by it to to address the issue
 
03:35:25.130 --> 03:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
with the school I did attend a Milford
 
03:35:26.809 --> 03:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
School District board meeting and gave a
 
03:35:28.729 --> 03:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
presentation to the school board because
 
03:35:31.849 --> 03:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
that school board was considering a
 
03:35:33.170 --> 03:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
change in policy which they ended up
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately including last night
 
03:35:36.769 --> 03:35:36.779 align:start position:0%
rejecting that potential change in
 
03:35:38.450 --> 03:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
policy would have prevented transgender
 
03:35:39.530 --> 03:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
students from using the restroom
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
consistent with their gender identity
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
but to this day the school district in
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
Milford has not adopted a change in
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
policy and continues to allow trans kids
 
03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
to use the bathroom in Maine
 
03:35:52.190 --> 03:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
um this goes back to 2014 so our
 
03:35:54.170 --> 03:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
neighbor in Maine the Supreme Court
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
there heard a case ultimately where my
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
organization had filed a lawsuit against
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
a school district because of excluding a
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
transgender girl from using the bathroom
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
from using the girl's bathroom and the
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
main Supreme Court ruled that that was a
 
03:36:08.929 --> 03:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
violation of of course a violation of
 
03:36:11.210 --> 03:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
the state's law against discrimination
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
against transgender people
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and the plaintiff in that case Nicole
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
means is now a successful movie star so
 
03:36:20.929 --> 03:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
it just goes to show that when uh you
 
03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
know you remove the obstacles that in
 
03:36:26.450 --> 03:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
achieving a good education people thrive
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you thank you so much
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:36:33.410 --> 03:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
03:36:34.969 --> 03:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you answered that
 
03:36:40.910 --> 03:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
there were no cases of non-trans people
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
pretending to get into to access
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
bathrooms but
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
if it's not a same-sex bathroom why
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
would there be a need to pretend there
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any barrier to either sex
 
03:36:56.410 --> 03:36:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I follow your question
 
03:37:00.170 --> 03:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
you don't have to give a reason to go
 
03:37:04.130 --> 03:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
into a bathroom if it's not gender
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive or sex exclusive
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
right I'm not I'm actually not familiar
 
03:37:11.570 --> 03:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
with uh you know I I heard some students
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
testifying about uh about bathrooms in
 
03:37:15.170 --> 03:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
their schools and then then what I
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
gathered from from the testimony was
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
that that anyone can go into whatever
 
03:37:20.570 --> 03:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
bathroom that they want I don't know if
 
03:37:22.130 --> 03:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's a school policy anywhere in New
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not I'm not up on any
 
03:37:25.370 --> 03:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
school policies that would that would
 
03:37:28.370 --> 03:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
that would say exactly that so um as far
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware there are policies
 
03:37:34.130 --> 03:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
that separate bathrooms based on sex and
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and also that those policies do not
 
03:37:38.929 --> 03:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
exclude transgender people or gender
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-conforming people from using the
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
bathroom that makes them most
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable which is still separated
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
based on sex it's just not excluding
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
trans people
 
03:37:48.650 --> 03:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so does that answer your question at
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
all because I I'm still not sure if I'm
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
catching one yeah and I think I'm go I
 
03:37:55.010 --> 03:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
mean I follow up no we're gonna move on
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
we'll talk later uh represent Damon
 
03:37:57.840 --> 03:37:59.330 align:start position:0%
we'll talk later uh represent Damon
foreign

03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
could you share with the committee and
 
03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
in writing would be fine
 
03:38:07.550 --> 03:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
um the rsas that this bill is in
 
03:38:09.050 --> 03:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
conflict with in New Hampshire so we
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
have that for our executive session
 
03:38:13.849 --> 03:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
please yeah um but absolutely but 138
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm calling 38 and 138 colon 39 those
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
two rsas are the school of
 
03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:19.849 align:start position:0%
two rsas are the school of
non-discrimination

03:38:19.849 --> 03:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination
 
03:38:22.010 --> 03:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
um you know statutes that speak most
 
03:38:23.450 --> 03:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
directly to this issue but there are a
 
03:38:25.610 --> 03:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
host of other statutes that are involved
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I'm happy to follow up in the
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee with laying it out I didn't
 
03:38:30.170 --> 03:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
prepare written testimony because I
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear what was being discussed
 
03:38:33.710 --> 03:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
here before I wrote something up for you
 
03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be useful so I'm going to do
 
03:38:37.250 --> 03:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
that later today or tomorrow and I'll
 
03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
send it to you thank you thank you
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
helpful representative McDonald thank
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for your
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
expertise and law in this area in
 
03:38:47.450 --> 03:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
particular my question is online for the
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill it says the word pupils which to me
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
thinks students or people at least for
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
our student age maybe a student at
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
another school would this exclude adults
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
from following this so the concern was
 
03:39:02.929 --> 03:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
maybe an adult who identifies as one
 
03:39:04.969 --> 03:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
gender but maybe biologically is another
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
in this bathroom with students I'm just
 
03:39:10.250 --> 03:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
curious this is where pupils apply to
 
03:39:10.260 --> 03:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
curious this is where pupils apply to
adults

03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:19.610 --> 03:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
if someone were to ask me what would
 
03:39:21.170 --> 03:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
what would a judge say about the word
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
pupil and whether it applied to adults I
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
would say a judge would probably say
 
03:39:25.610 --> 03:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't apply to adults in the
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimonies
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%

03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee you're welcome uh this
 
03:39:40.809 --> 03:39:40.819 align:start position:0%
concludes our testimony on 107 before
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
and what I'm going to try to do here is
 
03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:45.229 align:start position:0%
and what I'm going to try to do here is
that

03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:48.290 --> 03:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
the next bill 352 we have only four
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
cards and we get through this real
 
03:39:51.530 --> 03:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
rapidly and what I'd like to do because
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of those persons we have testifying
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
as a as an individual who's worked here
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
and we passed a bill in her son's name
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Martha Dickey uh when we dealt with
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention in the previous year
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
and she has to get out of here very
 
03:40:09.650 --> 03:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
quickly so I I've asked that Joe
 
03:40:12.370 --> 03:40:12.380 align:start position:0%
Alexander representative Alexander
 
03:40:16.610 --> 03:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh open this up quickly by presenting
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
the bill and then we can get uh
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
Martha Dickey and then there's two
 
03:40:23.809 --> 03:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
others all of these people are
 
03:40:26.690 --> 03:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of the Bill thank
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad members the committee
 
03:40:29.690 --> 03:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Joe Alexander
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of Goffstown I'm
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
here because we are on a mission to help
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
solve the mental and Behavioral Health
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
crisis especially month use youth in the
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
state this effort started my first term
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we passed SB 282 which had to do
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
with suicide awareness and prevention
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
training for minors with teachers
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
Educators and people that interact with
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
minors follow that last year pass and
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
sign into law SB 234 which would put the
 
03:40:59.210 --> 03:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
suicide hotline on every student ID in
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it was actually really
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
great to be able to see that Goffstown
 
03:41:06.050 --> 03:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
IDs with that number on the back so this
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
is a simple bill it would just allow for
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
a student to have an excused absence for
 
03:41:13.969 --> 03:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
a mental or behavioral health issue this
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
is not meant to be necessarily
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
structured the idea is is that it's an
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
awareness to tool for educators parents
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
and people that so students can help
 
03:41:25.969 --> 03:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
deal with Mental Health crisis so with
 
03:41:27.650 --> 03:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to defer to my friend
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
Martha Dickey who will kind of give a
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
better layout of the Bill thank you very
 
03:41:35.090 --> 03:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
much representative Alexander uh Martha
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%

bill that was passed in Jason's name and
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
um as Joe Alexander just said it is
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
great to hear from people where it's
 
03:41:52.250 --> 03:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
being implemented throughout the state I
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
will be brief because I do have to get
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to share my story
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
except for to say to folks who might not
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
know me
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
um I lost my son Jason in 2017 when he
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
was 19 and he took his life since then I
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
have worked with both This House and
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
Senate to recommend legislation that
 
03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
will help our young people have access
 
03:42:12.290 --> 03:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
to better support for their Mental

I believe that this bill complements

them having a mental health day
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%

03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
to destigmatize mental health as well as
 
03:43:21.650 --> 03:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
give the student a chance to rest and
 
03:43:24.110 --> 03:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
recharge the purpose of a mental health
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
day is to recognize and acknowledge the
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
fact that symptoms from these mental
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
health related conditions can often

rather An approved mental health absence

thank you very much for thank you Mr

chair and thank you very much for your
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
testimony your story is very moving I
 
03:44:25.610 --> 03:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
just have a question because I do hear I
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
homeschooled my kids but I do hear of
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
parents that say oh my son or daughter
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
just needed a mental health day when
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
kids call when parents call into school
 
03:44:36.650 --> 03:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
to have their kids excused do they have
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
to give a reason that they're keeping
 
03:44:40.010 --> 03:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
their child home that day or can they
 
03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
just say they don't feel good today and
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
and would that cover the mental health
 
03:44:45.650 --> 03:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
day I mean I'm fully aware that this is
 
03:44:47.929 --> 03:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
an important sure consideration thank
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
you that's a great question and um
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander and I have
 
03:44:53.090 --> 03:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
talked that through a little bit um I
 
03:44:54.290 --> 03:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
think some of it is subject to
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
interpretation I think it takes the need
 
03:44:59.330 --> 03:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
for a parent to feel like it's been a
 
03:45:00.769 --> 03:45:00.779 align:start position:0%
while since I've had a child in school
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
so it might take the need off the the
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
need to say you know Joey has a headache
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
today and he won't be in to maybe if
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
there was a crisis or you know potential
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
crisis to actually be upfront and say it
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
was a mental health day and perhaps open
 
03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
the door for communication
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are the further
 
03:45:17.399 --> 03:45:18.410 align:start position:0%

hello again
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Emma savini
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
I am the children's behavioral policy
 
03:45:51.530 --> 03:45:51.540 align:start position:0%

collaborates for the health and wellness
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
of all granted Staters we are here in
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
strong support of House Bill 352 because
 
03:46:04.849 --> 03:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
it would eliminate an inequity that
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
students are experiencing who are
 
03:46:08.210 --> 03:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental health challenges
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
experience every day
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
um as the bill sponsor said this is a
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
simple solution to allow for students to
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
take time off to decompress uh perform
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know self-care whatever they need to
 
03:46:24.050 --> 03:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
minimize future
 
03:46:24.060 --> 03:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
minimize future
um

03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:46:28.490 --> 03:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
symptoms of their mental illness and
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
improve the overall outcomes for their
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mental Illness but also give them time
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
to seek help if they needed it
 
03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:36.410 align:start position:0%
to seek help if they needed it
um

03:46:36.410 --> 03:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
as of right now at least 12 other states
 
03:46:41.050 --> 03:46:41.060 align:start position:0%
have passed similar legislation to this
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
and many others are have it pending like
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
removing these barriers this barrier of
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
having an absence on their report card
 
03:46:54.170 --> 03:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
removes the stigma of having mental
 
03:46:56.929 --> 03:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
illness and also improves the ability
 
03:46:58.969 --> 03:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
for students to take that time without
 
03:47:01.250 --> 03:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
fear of negative consequences to their
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
grades and other aspects of their
 
03:47:03.899 --> 03:47:05.110 align:start position:0%
grades and other aspects of their
education

03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we are in strong support
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%

03:47:11.690 --> 03:47:11.700 align:start position:0%

statistics on for instance what percent
 
03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
of students experience some sort of
 
03:47:25.849 --> 03:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
mental health condition that might fall
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%

depressive episode in the past year
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
which is higher than the national
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%

03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative dry
 
03:49:59.929 --> 03:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
taking a question
 
03:50:01.500 --> 03:50:02.630 align:start position:0%
taking a question
um

03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
I see a lot of these kind of problems as
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
an EMT we're talking specifically about
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
the student there or with a familial
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
problem with mental health be a
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
justification for taking a day like this
 
03:50:17.809 --> 03:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure whether there there
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
would be room for that in in what's
 
03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:21.229 align:start position:0%
would be room for that in in what's
proposed

03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I do think of family Mental Health
 
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
crisis uh allowing for an absence for
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
just to give me a better understanding
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
of mental health versus Behavioral
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
Health can you give me a couple things
 
03:50:38.450 --> 03:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
that might fall under each category
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
sure I think uh mental and Behavioral
 
03:50:42.530 --> 03:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
Health uh sort of together as an
 
03:50:43.550 --> 03:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
umbrella term
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
um cover it's obviously mental health
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
disorders like depression anxiety and
 
03:50:49.490 --> 03:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
then Behavioral Health would cover other
 
03:50:51.889 --> 03:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
disorders such as autism ADHD things
 
03:50:55.250 --> 03:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
like that I believe
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
03:50:57.779 --> 03:50:59.210 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

03:50:59.210 --> 03:50:59.220 align:start position:0%

where

03:51:06.530 --> 03:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:51:11.170 --> 03:51:11.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%

03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
different bills okay for the committee
 
03:51:18.050 --> 03:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a break now
 
03:51:18.060 --> 03:51:19.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a break now
um

03:51:19.150 --> 03:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:23.690 --> 03:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
we for for our physical health and
 
03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
social health and mental health uh we're
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
going to have to um take advantage I
 
03:51:30.889 --> 03:51:30.899 align:start position:0%
don't know but sometimes I take a mental
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
health and I get out of the house and I
 
03:51:33.610 --> 03:51:33.620 align:start position:0%
go fishing
 
03:51:37.190 --> 03:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
and that's a great pain reliever so
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely we will take a break here and
 
03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%

Newell and I'm representing Cheshire

students
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
and all my testimony I aim to speak on a
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
particular aspect that may not otherwise
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
be covered by others so while I would
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
direct you to the mental health experts
 
04:40:38.570 --> 04:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
who will be contributing their support
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
whether in person or through emails of
 
04:40:43.730 --> 04:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
support as well as the New Hampshire the
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
wonderful New Hampshire students who
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
have organized diligently around this
 
04:40:48.170 --> 04:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
issue some of whom have come here today
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
to share their personal experience on
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
the necessity of this bill
 
04:40:54.170 --> 04:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
but my intention is to answer two
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions why is this necessary and why
 
04:40:58.730 --> 04:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
in this form
 
04:41:00.590 --> 04:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
the short answer to both is that mental
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
health is truly fundamental and
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
far-reaching mental health permeates all
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of Education the way we learn
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
how we receive and relate to the
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
information and those learning alongside
 
04:41:13.010 --> 04:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
us as well as how we utilize what we've
 
04:41:13.020 --> 04:41:14.270 align:start position:0%
us as well as how we utilize what we've
learned

04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
learned
 
04:41:16.490 --> 04:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
further our schools prepare young people
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
to participate fully in our society and
 
04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
that will Define our social structure
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
and policies after we are gone or as I
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
like to remind my boys when the tables
 
04:41:26.770 --> 04:41:26.780 align:start position:0%
turn and they'll be taking care of me
 
04:41:29.448 --> 04:41:29.458 align:start position:0%
educating these Minds requires that we
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand how they function
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to heal uh he their unique
 
04:41:37.128 --> 04:41:37.138 align:start position:0%
challenges and thought processes and
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
integrate this knowledge into our
 
04:41:40.250 --> 04:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
preparation for the many aspects that
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
they will encounter in adulthood simply
 
04:41:45.050 --> 04:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
put a comprehensive understanding of
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
mental health is fundamental to Leading
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
good and productive lives which is why I
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
feel the inclusion of mental uh of
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education in
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
this section of long which establishes
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
the essential topics to be covered in
 
04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school health
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
curriculum is extremely important and
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my introduction
 
04:42:05.810 --> 04:42:05.820 align:start position:0%

04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I have a clear
 
04:42:24.770 --> 04:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
between are we talking about the the
 
04:42:26.930 --> 04:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
teaching of mental health is in like
 
04:42:29.330 --> 04:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
teaching a psychology course or are we
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the practice of mental
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
health as in we're practicing psychology
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
to help students be more like well-being
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
or or something along those lines yeah
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
great question actually we have some
 
04:42:41.930 --> 04:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
really great resources in the state of
 
04:42:43.730 --> 04:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire around supporting people
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh to manage the mental health and
 
04:42:47.930 --> 04:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
things like that what we're talking
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
about here is comprehensive mental
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
health education would be that would be
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
teaching people about various aspects of
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
mental health this is to be included in
 
04:42:58.250 --> 04:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
the health curriculum which already
 
04:43:00.288 --> 04:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
covers things like you know physical
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
education why would you not cover things
 
04:43:04.850 --> 04:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
like uh your uh your emotional
 
04:43:06.650 --> 04:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
well-being in a variety of different
 
04:43:10.250 --> 04:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
things so that rather than a teacher or
 
04:43:12.050 --> 04:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
an adult keeping an eye out for which
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
they already do uh keeping out keeping
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
an eye out for different symptoms and
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
factors that may indicate somebody is
 
04:43:19.850 --> 04:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
struggling with their mental health this
 
04:43:22.368 --> 04:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
would provide a broad understanding for
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
the students themselves so that uh you
 
04:43:26.690 --> 04:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
know even if it's not visible to a
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
teacher or something like that they can
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
understand what what is happening and
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
learn how to reach out to support uh
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
reach out to those uh you know the many
 
04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
supports that we have and then it'll
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
help them to manage that as they're
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
04:43:41.690 --> 04:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it those are
 
04:43:41.700 --> 04:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it those are
questions

04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
can you give a thank you for taking my
 
04:43:49.490 --> 04:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
question by the way can you give a
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
further definition of what you mean by
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive how much how in-depth
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
Etc is is do you mean by that well I
 
04:44:00.170 --> 04:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
think the point of putting it in this
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
piece of uh in this part of the law is
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
to establish it as a priority
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
um that people so so it doesn't
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily flesh out exactly what it's
 
04:44:12.650 --> 04:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to be taught so we talk about the
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
other things that are in this uh in this
 
04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
part of the law are you know things like
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
teaching people teaching children about
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
physical education it's like teaching
 
04:44:22.128 --> 04:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
kids about HIV and AIDS about suicide
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
prevention those kind of things
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so what this part of the law does is
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
it sets out these specific topics that
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
we want to be prioritized and then that
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
is fleshed out as far as how it's
 
04:44:33.770 --> 04:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
implemented would be fleshed out later
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
basically what this bill says is that
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
this should be a priority and we should
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
be incorporating this into our health
 
04:44:42.050 --> 04:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
curriculum in whatever way that takes
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
form I think that would be the next step
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the first step saying
 
04:44:47.448 --> 04:44:47.458 align:start position:0%
this is a priority let's let's work it
 
04:44:47.458 --> 04:44:48.650 align:start position:0%
this is a priority let's let's work it
out

04:44:48.650 --> 04:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:44:52.850 --> 04:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I kind of follow up
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
on that on the previous question so if
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
the word comprehensive were not in here
 
04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
with the priorities do you think that it
 
04:45:03.298 --> 04:45:04.368 align:start position:0%
with the priorities do you think that it
would

04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
end up being implemented differently or
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I thank you for the question I I I
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I think
 
04:45:14.570 --> 04:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
um the difference is is that we really
 
04:45:16.850 --> 04:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know in using the word
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
comprehensive we're really trying to say
 
04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
that there should be a firm
 
04:45:24.350 --> 04:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of a variety of mental
 
04:45:25.970 --> 04:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
health issues I think a lot of times we
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
talk about uh you know people are aware
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
of uh learning disabilities I I let me
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
just tell you about my own son you know
 
04:45:35.208 --> 04:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
my own son comes home and he's telling
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
me about things that he's learning in
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
school he asked me
 
04:45:40.490 --> 04:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
um about if a friend of his has ADHD
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
says you think he has ADHD he said well
 
04:45:44.330 --> 04:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so and so we're talking
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
about you know what are what are kind of
 
04:45:47.810 --> 04:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
the symptoms of that and as soon as I
 
04:45:49.730 --> 04:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
start lifting up listing off the
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
symptoms he says oh no that's not it so
 
04:45:53.570 --> 04:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
all right well you know what ADHD is but
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
you don't know what the actual symptoms
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
are you know what I mean so you know
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
what an ADHD is a very very familiar one
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
whether he learned it in school or
 
04:46:01.730 --> 04:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
anything else people I think are are
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
commonly aware of that now I think it's
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
a about having
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
a deeper understanding so that people
 
04:46:10.850 --> 04:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
understand what are the sign that
 
04:46:12.770 --> 04:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
children understand what are the signs
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
and symptoms for for that kind of issue
 
04:46:19.730 --> 04:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
not that one only but you know are there
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
see any thank you very much I'd like to

04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
and letting me to testify on House Bill
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
505 today
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
04:46:52.010 --> 04:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
William Darby from Hillsborough uh
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
District 11 Nashville Ward 8.
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
I offer a personal family experience in
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
support of this bill one of our fan one
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
of our daughters has high functioning
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
autism and an executive function
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
disorder while she acted immaturely for
 
04:47:06.288 --> 04:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
her physical age and struggled with
 
04:47:08.570 --> 04:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
friendships she did well academically
 
04:47:12.050 --> 04:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
and in elementary and middle school she
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
struggled so I'm in the less structured
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
environment of high school but decided
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
against an IEP because she wanted to
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
remain with her classmates and graduated
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
in four years
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of years after high school
 
04:47:25.368 --> 04:47:25.378 align:start position:0%
while enrolled in college our daughter
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
had a psychotic break with
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
hallucinations that caused her to be
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
retained in the emergency room for
 
04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
several days before the psychiatrist
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
would release her to inpatient care
 
04:47:39.410 --> 04:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
since we were fortunate enough to have
 
04:47:41.690 --> 04:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage
 
04:47:44.330 --> 04:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
it was determined that she had developed
 
04:47:46.850 --> 04:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
psychiatric sorry psychotic depression
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
which led to many scary months for our
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
daughter and family as we signifi and
 
04:47:53.570 --> 04:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
was a significant setback to her
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
progress in school
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
with therapy and medication our daughter
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
can now largely manage your illness and
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's completing our bachelor's at snoo
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
as she is both introspective and highly
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
articulate we discussed her
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I discussed her mental health
 
04:48:12.770 --> 04:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
challenges with her my wife and I didn't
 
04:48:14.570 --> 04:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
she offered Keen insights that I share
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
with you now
 
04:48:18.050 --> 04:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
it was during first it was during an
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
optional psychology High School class
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
where she first realized that she may
 
04:48:24.050 --> 04:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
have depression after taking a
 
04:48:24.060 --> 04:48:25.730 align:start position:0%
have depression after taking a
self-assessment

04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
self-assessment
 
04:48:27.410 --> 04:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
while this helped her understand her
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
behavior she did not share her Discovery
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
with anyone including her sisters likely
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
due to embarrassment
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
she also conveyed how her peers would
 
04:48:40.730 --> 04:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
talk down to her in a childless voice in
 
04:48:42.770 --> 04:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
school as they lacked the understanding
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
that her autism did not effective
 
04:48:46.550 --> 04:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
cognitive abilities
 
04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental Health would have
 
04:48:50.930 --> 04:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
directly benefited our daughter for
 
04:48:52.610 --> 04:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
numerous reasons including
 
04:48:54.890 --> 04:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
destigmatizing mental illness
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
teaching engagement skills and helping
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
students recognize the onset of mental
 
04:49:02.208 --> 04:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
illnesses in themselves and others
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
for many people Mountain almostis are
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
first diagnosed during adolescence and
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
early adulthood
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
mental health is just
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it's just uh is just as essential to
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
students development as health education
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
wellness and physical education which
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
are currently required by RSA 189 10.
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
I would it would help many students like
 
04:49:26.448 --> 04:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
our daughter to reach their potential
 
04:49:29.090 --> 04:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
and become productive adults I urge you
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on House Bill 505.
 
04:49:32.690 --> 04:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee yes
 
04:49:36.650 --> 04:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:49:41.090 --> 04:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to know do you know of
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
any uh mental health curriculums that
 
04:49:50.090 --> 04:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
are being used either in the state or in
 
04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:49:53.810 --> 04:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware I can tell you that she
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
was not
 
04:49:58.128 --> 04:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
um like I mentioned the psychology class
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
where she learned about the principles
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
of psychology not um Psychology from a
 
04:50:04.730 --> 04:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
health perspective
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
um was her first sort of exposure to it
 
04:50:08.638 --> 04:50:11.208 align:start position:0%
um was her first sort of exposure to it
yes

04:50:11.208 --> 04:50:11.218 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:50:15.288 --> 04:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
sorry as a follow-up um do you envision
 
04:50:18.288 --> 04:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
that this curriculum would be taught by
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's the question who who
 
04:50:24.050 --> 04:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
would teach this curriculum
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it would be
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
um health professionals the same way the
 
04:50:30.350 --> 04:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
health professionals teach Wellness
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
um teach different aspects of of Health
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
I think that you
 
04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
um you can learn the curriculum and and
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
convey the curriculum
 
04:50:43.490 --> 04:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you the speaker is an
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
interesting spot today
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned autism spectrum
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
disorder and the way I interpreted this
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill it says Comprehensive Mental Health
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
I interpreted that to teach on subjects
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
such as anxiety depression would
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
neurodivergent conditions such as autism
 
04:51:07.610 --> 04:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's in my family as well do you
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
believe that would be taught within the
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
realm of this bill as well
 
04:51:15.010 --> 04:51:15.020 align:start position:0%
no I would hope so a autism depression
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
eating disorders that I think there's a
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
wide variety of
 
04:51:21.730 --> 04:51:21.740 align:start position:0%
um mental health issues and that's why I
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the word comprehensive all
 
04:51:25.730 --> 04:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh the represent
 
04:51:27.480 --> 04:51:28.788 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh the represent
Belcher

04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for the
 
04:51:30.298 --> 04:51:31.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for the
testimony

04:51:31.850 --> 04:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
um we heard earlier that it's a it's a
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
teaching um tool to to educate people on
 
04:51:38.810 --> 04:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
04:51:42.170 --> 04:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not misunderstanding however
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
that there might be some sort of a
 
04:51:47.628 --> 04:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
screening element involved in this for
 
04:51:49.250 --> 04:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
mental health or something along those
 
04:51:52.730 --> 04:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
lines no I I did not suggest no I what I
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
interpreted uh
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that bill sponsor um to say is is
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
largely what I tried to summarize it
 
04:52:04.128 --> 04:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
will teach students how to
 
04:52:06.050 --> 04:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
um about mental opennesses which will
 
04:52:08.448 --> 04:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
destigmatize it it will teach them how
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
to engage with students that have mental
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
illnesses which will help them engage
 
04:52:16.010 --> 04:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
with them uh more readily and it will
 
04:52:19.610 --> 04:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
help them to recognize the onsets of
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
potential mental illnesses so they might
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
be able to recognize that in themselves
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
or their peers there's I don't expect at
 
04:52:25.320 --> 04:52:26.510 align:start position:0%
or their peers there's I don't expect at
all

04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:52:28.730 --> 04:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
um you know a teacher to be diagnosing
 
04:52:28.740 --> 04:52:31.628 align:start position:0%
um you know a teacher to be diagnosing
students

04:52:31.628 --> 04:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:52:34.250 --> 04:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
further questions representative luno
 
04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
for uh thanks for joining us this
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon as well as to the uh the prime
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor for uh for bringing this in
 
04:52:41.878 --> 04:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
sponsor for uh for bringing this in
today

04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering too if if under
 
04:52:48.288 --> 04:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
wellness and comprehensive mental health
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
um such a subject could also include
 
04:52:54.410 --> 04:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and you know I I totally understand
 
04:52:57.650 --> 04:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
that not everybody in New Hampshire has
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
um you know is able to
 
04:53:01.850 --> 04:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
um Avail themselves of health insurance
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
but a large percentage of granite
 
04:53:07.850 --> 04:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
Staters do either through um through
 
04:53:07.860 --> 04:53:09.170 align:start position:0%
Staters do either through um through
um

04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
um the um the the Affordable Care Act or
 
04:53:13.970 --> 04:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
through their employer or through other
 
04:53:16.610 --> 04:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
self-insured plans uh or through the
 
04:53:19.250 --> 04:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage but that all of these
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
plans are are required to um to provide
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
um uh access on a on a on apartment
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
parity you know mental health parity
 
04:53:34.368 --> 04:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
um uh health insurance coverage uh along
 
04:53:37.010 --> 04:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
with you know comparable to
 
04:53:39.770 --> 04:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and to the same extent as they do uh
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
physical wellness and that having that
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge would be beneficial for uh for
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
students coming through our system could
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
that be part of
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
this sort of comprehensive
 
04:53:52.930 --> 04:53:52.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not totally understood
 
04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
just creating an awareness that uh that
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
that the uh that our health care uh
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
industry as well as the insurance
 
04:54:03.050 --> 04:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
industry have to cover mental health
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
conditions um I think that makes sense
 
04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
right um recognizing that
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I think students are used to
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
going to the um you know to their yearly
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
checkups right but they're not used to
 
04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to their their yearly councilman
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
appointments because they don't have
 
04:54:20.760 --> 04:54:21.650 align:start position:0%
appointments because they don't have
them

04:54:21.650 --> 04:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:54:24.350 --> 04:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
um like I mentioned and the research is
 
04:54:27.650 --> 04:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
you know is very easy to find a large
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
number of uh adolescents and young
 
04:54:32.208 --> 04:54:32.218 align:start position:0%
people first experience severe mental
 
04:54:34.250 --> 04:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
health issues for example psychotic
 
04:54:34.260 --> 04:54:35.448 align:start position:0%
health issues for example psychotic
breaks

04:54:35.448 --> 04:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
breaks
 
04:54:38.448 --> 04:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
um another daughter of ours ended up
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
with dated a young man who had um who
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
had his first uh incidents with bipolar
 
04:54:44.160 --> 04:54:45.410 align:start position:0%
had his first uh incidents with bipolar
disorder

04:54:45.410 --> 04:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
um in his early 20s after she had dated
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
him for many many months so I can point
 
04:54:52.850 --> 04:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
to two specific examples in my own life
 
04:54:55.490 --> 04:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
where people did not see this coming and
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they have you know these
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
really serious impacts recognizing you
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
know the onset of those and recognizing
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
that there are there is help for those I
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
think would would be very beneficial
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:13.550 --> 04:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
um do you know and thank you for taking
 
04:55:16.970 --> 04:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
my question do you have any idea of
 
04:55:19.310 --> 04:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
what's actually being taught within our
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
or even prescribed by the um
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
department of education standards for
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
health education right now whether it
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
includes Mental Health
 
04:55:28.920 --> 04:55:30.410 align:start position:0%
includes Mental Health
it's

04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:55:32.330 --> 04:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I did a little bit of
 
04:55:32.340 --> 04:55:33.890 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I did a little bit of
research

04:55:33.890 --> 04:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
research
 
04:55:36.288 --> 04:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and this is not an area of expertise
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
of mine but I did do a little bit of
 
04:55:40.610 --> 04:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
research and I do find some
 
04:55:43.490 --> 04:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
um recommendations it looks like that
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
the state puts out for mental health
 
04:55:48.410 --> 04:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that another daughter
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
of ours we have six daughters
 
04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
um uh uh is a mental health nurse that's
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
what she does professionally now
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
um she has also she spent a lot of time
 
04:56:01.850 --> 04:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
now with my with our daughter that I've
 
04:56:03.288 --> 04:56:03.298 align:start position:0%
mentioned here
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
um that this was
 
04:56:08.570 --> 04:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
she went to school in Manchester
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
um this was not something that she did
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
not have this background coming out of
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
school either so I'm not sure what the
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
standard is but I I don't believe that
 
04:56:18.530 --> 04:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
it is if there is one that it is being
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
upheld to a level that is helping the
 
04:56:22.970 --> 04:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
students adequately
 
04:56:25.310 --> 04:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
um just as a follow-up um so I taught
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
health for a long time and
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
um we always had uh and even now there's
 
04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
a unit on suicide prevention uh mental
 
04:56:36.170 --> 04:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
health first aid and stress but it's
 
04:56:38.330 --> 04:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's a it's more General than I think
 
04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
your daughter's course in Psychology
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
which probably was at the junior senior
 
04:56:48.430 --> 04:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much
 
04:56:54.770 --> 04:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
for the time today
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I think we've asked a couple of
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
technical questions as to this point so
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite up here Elizabeth
 
04:57:03.770 --> 04:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
Eaton she's representing the board of
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.448 --> 04:57:11.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman and
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
before you get into yeah you know
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
because you've been haven't indicated
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
you hear more for technical support I I
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming because there's nothing
 
04:57:20.090 --> 04:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
check whether you support or don't
 
04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
support what correct the the board does
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
not take a specific position uh
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
generally they would support this but I
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
do have some uh written statement from
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
um from the board so I'm here to present
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
you please then go forward with your
 
04:57:37.850 --> 04:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
written statements and communicate that
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
with us and then we may have some
 
04:57:43.090 --> 04:57:43.100 align:start position:0%
technical questions one of which what is
 
04:57:46.090 --> 04:57:46.100 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
adverse Mental Health
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
so certainly okay thank you why don't
 
04:57:51.890 --> 04:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
you go ahead with yours and then we'll
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
ask these type of questions thank you uh
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
this is from Debbie Robinson she is a
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Board of
 
04:57:59.690 --> 04:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
mental health practice and she wrote I
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
am writing today to support hb505 I
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Board of
 
04:58:05.810 --> 04:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
mental health practice as a public
 
04:58:08.090 --> 04:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
member I have worked in mental health in
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for 28 years and can
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
affirm that a lack of comprehensive
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
mental health education in school
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
curriculums is to the detriment of
 
04:58:18.170 --> 04:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
students and the adults who love and
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
support them
 
04:58:22.010 --> 04:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
children pre-teens and teenagers are
 
04:58:24.770 --> 04:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
struggling with a complex world at the
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
same time they are experiencing complex
 
04:58:29.570 --> 04:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
emotions and relationships
 
04:58:31.730 --> 04:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
many of them do not have awareness of
 
04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
warning signs of mental health struggles
 
04:58:36.770 --> 04:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
let alone what is normal or what is
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
expected given the stressors they
 
04:58:40.850 --> 04:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
experience and how to process all of it
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
open dialogue about these risk factors
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
and how to seek appropriate support will
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
create opportunities for care that can
 
04:58:50.288 --> 04:58:50.298 align:start position:0%
be life-changing and in some cases
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
life-saving we owe this to our young
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
people their families and the community
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's the end of the written testimony
 
04:59:00.170 --> 04:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I do believe she emailed it to the
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
board to the committee members earlier
 
04:59:02.878 --> 04:59:03.830 align:start position:0%
board to the committee members earlier
today

04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
I want to before any questions come up I
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that I work for the
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
certification I'm an attorney I'm not a
 
04:59:14.690 --> 04:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
mental health professional however I do
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
sit in on all of their meetings I hear
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
all of their discussion tonight
 
04:59:20.090 --> 04:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and they voted to
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
um send me before you to represent them
 
04:59:26.090 --> 04:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
but I do have one
 
04:59:30.410 --> 04:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
um the bill starts out the school shall
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
ensure the health education physical
 
04:59:31.980 --> 04:59:33.830 align:start position:0%
ensure the health education physical
education

04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
are part of our curriculum
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time I look at the
 
04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm seeing that the
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
Department's estimating well there might
 
04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
be a need to purchase material
 
04:59:47.570 --> 04:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
but I don't see any labor costs
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
associated with this beyond what may
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
already be in existence where we're
 
04:59:54.650 --> 04:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
teaching it through
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
how the local wants to do that whether
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
it be through the physical education
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
teacher the health teacher Etc so
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
um where I'm asking is when I see the
 
05:00:05.650 --> 05:00:05.660 align:start position:0%
word comprehend I see other areas like
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
physiology and hygiene and health and
 
05:00:11.930 --> 05:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
what we discussed previously in previous
 
05:00:13.610 --> 05:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
years here and added to the wellness
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
portions of this
 
05:00:19.550 --> 05:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
but nowhere do we say comprehensive we
 
05:00:23.810 --> 05:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
say things like mental health and then
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
um I think it it gets out of that domain
 
05:00:28.010 --> 05:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
where we could almost Comprehensive
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health get into a singular course
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:00:34.850 --> 05:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so that's my concern so I was wanting
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
to know if the board had some kind of
 
05:00:38.690 --> 05:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
understanding what is meant by
 
05:00:41.090 --> 05:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental Health the next if
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
you don't the next one's going to go to
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education sitting back
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
there Diana and to find out where they
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
are on that or even Rebecca Fredette
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
because we see things like autism
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
and other health impaired emotional
 
05:00:58.368 --> 05:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
disabilities all is categorical IEP
 
05:01:02.090 --> 05:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
categories out of the 13. so where are
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
we you know where's this thing going is
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
and how are we defining it
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
I can only speak to how the board um
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
looked at this and discussed this bill
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
um when you when you look at the words
 
05:01:14.520 --> 05:01:15.350 align:start position:0%
um when you when you look at the words
um

05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at health education and
 
05:01:19.368 --> 05:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
then it kind of breaks it down into
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
physiology hygiene health and
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships
 
05:01:25.250 --> 05:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
um that's all part of what health
 
05:01:27.730 --> 05:01:27.740 align:start position:0%
education is and so there isn't any
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown here of Comprehensive Mental
 
05:01:31.490 --> 05:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
Health there's no breakdown of mental
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
health into different categories the
 
05:01:34.970 --> 05:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
same way that the the other physical

education and health education was
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
broken down
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm guessing but I don't know I
 
05:01:40.560 --> 05:01:41.570 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm guessing but I don't know I
didn't

didn't
 
05:01:43.850 --> 05:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know we didn't get into what it
 
05:01:46.730 --> 05:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
specifically means but that's the
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
overview of what the board discussed
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%

trainings with schools and different
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
things so I don't know how much

different this would be or what is
 
05:02:38.570 --> 05:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
actually happening with that so it would
 
05:02:40.368 --> 05:02:40.378 align:start position:0%
be nice to have someone
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%

in and tell us what is going on in the
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%

something is I I know that there are
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
trainings that districts can sign up for
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
to to have stuff done so it would be
 
05:02:57.170 --> 05:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
nice to get
 
05:02:57.180 --> 05:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
nice to get
some

05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%

05:03:01.490 --> 05:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
knowledge yeah I agree with you and we
 
05:03:01.500 --> 05:03:02.150 align:start position:0%
knowledge yeah I agree with you and we

05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
let's continue on with the hearing
 
05:03:05.570 --> 05:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
process then
 
05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.770 --> 05:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually here to read one of the
 
05:03:19.850 --> 05:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
testimonies from one of the high
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%

um so good morning
um

05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
I'm Erica Perez but I'm reading
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
um Nancy mathur's
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that's funny
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
so it says my name is Nancy mature I'm
 
05:03:43.010 --> 05:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
from Hudson New Hampshire I would like
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of hb505
 
05:03:48.288 --> 05:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education is
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly important in schools all
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire students having
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
access to adequate Mental Health
 
05:03:56.330 --> 05:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
Resources has remained a challenge for
 
05:03:58.490 --> 05:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire and this bill
 
05:03:59.930 --> 05:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
Works to strengthen mental health
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
education in schools as a high school as
 
05:04:06.050 --> 05:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
a senior in high school I have seen many
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
of my peer struggle with their mental
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
health due to these struggles some
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
students rely on substances as a coping
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism which causes even more harmful
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
effects both physical and mental
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
therefore it is crucial to provide
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
adequate mental health education in
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
schools students will then be aware of
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
proper resources that are available to
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
help them during these challenging times
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
as the president of my school spring
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
change to mind Club
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
I work with peers to raise awareness
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
surrounding mental health stigma this
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
club runs after school although we do
 
05:04:41.208 --> 05:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
have a solid group of students in this
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
club some students cannot make it to
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
club meetings due to sports driving
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
situations and other activities this
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill makes sure that schools Implement
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
proper mental health education in
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
certain classes they're structured
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
this allows for all students to have the
 
05:05:00.170 --> 05:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
same mental health education and
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
increases accessibility to that
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
information because students who have
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
been driving and working situations can
 
05:05:09.288 --> 05:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
also receive that education this bill
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
Works to ensure that students are better
 
05:05:13.368 --> 05:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
equipped with knowledge to navigate
 
05:05:15.650 --> 05:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
challenging times and provides
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
up-to-date and adequate resources so
 
05:05:19.490 --> 05:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
students can find help during these
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
tough times thank you for your
 
05:05:23.288 --> 05:05:23.298 align:start position:0%
consideration please vote on to pass on
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.010 --> 05:05:37.020 align:start position:0%

05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
um there are so many attempts um to help
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
you know there we have social workers
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors
 
05:06:16.250 --> 05:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
um School psychologists our teachers are
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
trained in SEL and trauma-based
 
05:06:21.170 --> 05:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
um education
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
um there's just there is a lot of
 
05:06:27.170 --> 05:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
support I am not for or against this
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill I just want to give you my
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
perspective in that comprehensive is
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
very nebulous and also students these
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
the mental health issues kids are
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
bringing to school these days are very
 
05:06:46.128 --> 05:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
very serious multifaceted and cannot be
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
treated in a school setting and I my
 
05:06:53.090 --> 05:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
concern is that if a teacher is tasked
 
05:06:58.128 --> 05:06:58.138 align:start position:0%
with teaching mental health to students
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're she's not gonna or they're not
 
05:07:02.090 --> 05:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
gonna know who is suffering from what
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
mental illness it's a confidential thing
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
a student can be triggered or whatever
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
and the teacher is not going to know
 
05:07:10.260 --> 05:07:11.810 align:start position:0%
and the teacher is not going to know
that

05:07:11.810 --> 05:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and what about a student that um is
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
secretly suicide has suicidal ideation
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
um goes to these um classes and makes an
 
05:07:21.958 --> 05:07:23.530 align:start position:0%
um goes to these um classes and makes an
attempt

05:07:23.530 --> 05:07:23.540 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
05:07:26.208 --> 05:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
his classmates or their classmates are
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
going to feel very guilty because they
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
didn't pick up on those signs
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
um I just feel that
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
the level of mental health the kids are
 
05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
suffering from from is best left to
 
05:07:38.100 --> 05:07:39.770 align:start position:0%
suffering from from is best left to
licensed

05:07:39.770 --> 05:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
05:07:43.250 --> 05:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals who are
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
better equipped to deal with students to
 
05:07:49.850 --> 05:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
put a teacher in the position of
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
um generally teaching mental health
 
05:07:53.810 --> 05:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
Concepts and how what's healthy and
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
what's not it sounds good but I do think
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a some collateral
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
incidents that we aren't even aware of
 
05:08:04.550 --> 05:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I do have an example of that one of
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
my schools we brought in the
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
administration brought in a program
 
05:08:11.930 --> 05:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
um you know to prevent um a certain
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
thing I don't want to get into specifics
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
I looked at the curriculum the materials
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
went to the orientation sounded
 
05:08:21.050 --> 05:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
wonderful well the last activity of the
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
day the students had to draw a picture
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the pictures the kids drew were
 
05:08:31.010 --> 05:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
disturbing on themselves and then the
 
05:08:33.770 --> 05:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
kids that never had an exposure looked
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
at these pictures both of those kids
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
groups were very confused and there was
 
05:08:40.250 --> 05:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
nobody to help process help those
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
students process process any of it they
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
were just left to go
 
05:08:46.610 --> 05:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
I was very uncomfortable with that
 
05:08:46.620 --> 05:08:47.810 align:start position:0%
I was very uncomfortable with that
luckily

05:08:47.810 --> 05:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
luckily
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
nothing came of that but that is just
 
05:08:54.410 --> 05:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
one potential for having a teacher who
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
is not a mental health professional help
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
kids it's just to me I would like to see
 
05:09:02.770 --> 05:09:02.780 align:start position:0%
that left in the hands of a
 
05:09:05.448 --> 05:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
professionals teachers are you know
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
health class you already cover hygiene
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know nutrition uh you know
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
dangers of drugs some sex ed they cover
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
you know the basics this is a whole
 
05:09:21.170 --> 05:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
other level that does leave me with some
 
05:09:23.650 --> 05:09:23.660 align:start position:0%
concerns as to safety
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
students have so much access the student
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
if they're if they feel they're in
 
05:09:30.110 --> 05:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
crisis or a friend that has some
 
05:09:30.120 --> 05:09:31.310 align:start position:0%
crisis or a friend that has some
concerns

05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
all the guidance counselors all the
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
social workers all the teachers doors
 
05:09:37.250 --> 05:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
the principals are always open and the
 
05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
kids know that
 
05:09:38.718 --> 05:09:40.430 align:start position:0%
kids know that
so

05:09:40.430 --> 05:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:43.368 --> 05:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
I just think that this is not maybe not
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
necessary at best and at worst you know
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
may cause some untowered effects to our
 
05:09:51.288 --> 05:09:51.298 align:start position:0%
our student population so thank you very
 
05:09:53.090 --> 05:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
much I'll take any questions thank you
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative Belcher
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
05:09:59.930 --> 05:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
testimony I think you raised an
 
05:10:01.850 --> 05:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
important point that sparked an idea in
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
my head
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
as it comes to comprehensive and you
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
said it is a little bit of a nebulous
 
05:10:08.570 --> 05:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
concept and as I consider some of the
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
stuff I've read into things like
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
um well-being and some of the concepts
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
that are Incorporated under under these
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
broad umbrellas I'm wondering and is it
 
05:10:21.770 --> 05:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
possible that we actually could Under
 
05:10:24.170 --> 05:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
the Umbrella of comprehensive
 
05:10:27.170 --> 05:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
be getting into some topics that might
 
05:10:29.690 --> 05:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
be controversial might be perhaps
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
ideological even that parents might not
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
agree with absolutely and if there was a
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum adopted I think that there
 
05:10:38.810 --> 05:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
definitely needs some parent input and
 
05:10:38.820 --> 05:10:40.270 align:start position:0%
definitely needs some parent input and
transparency

05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing in a positive note
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
though on Mental Health Wellness is
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the students take activity
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
breaks they do mindfulness they do you
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
know deep breathing that is all good but
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about you know
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
bringing up suicide depression Eating
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
Disorders cutting we have so many kids
 
05:11:07.128 --> 05:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
now that cut I just think that um you
 
05:11:09.410 --> 05:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
know it's this is dealing with this and
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
addressing this cannot be learned in a
 
05:11:11.160 --> 05:11:12.288 align:start position:0%
addressing this cannot be learned in a
weekend

05:11:12.288 --> 05:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
05:11:15.550 --> 05:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
um you know staff development this takes
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
a course of study to you know to be able
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
to really help students and I think
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's best left to their professionals
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a questions representative Myler
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
being here so I'm a little confused on
 
05:11:36.170 --> 05:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
where do you draw the line between
 
05:11:39.890 --> 05:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
information sharing in a curriculum for
 
05:11:39.900 --> 05:11:41.150 align:start position:0%
information sharing in a curriculum for
example

05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis of the fear
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
that the knowledge of that information
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
may take someone over the edge can you
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
talk it from a nursing standpoint can
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
you talk about that fine line between
 
05:11:58.490 --> 05:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
information versus unintended
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of that information I think
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
I understand so what you're saying is
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
just because a student is presented with
 
05:12:06.128 --> 05:12:06.138 align:start position:0%
an uncomfortable
 
05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
topic will that cause that student to
 
05:12:11.930 --> 05:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
spiral or decompensate
 
05:12:14.570 --> 05:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not a mental health professional I'm
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
just putting that out there as a
 
05:12:20.208 --> 05:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
potential but what I can see happening
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
is if you know if there is a student
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's kind of struggling
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
um and does make an attempt
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
um his class their classmates may feel
 
05:12:31.128 --> 05:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
responsible because they took this class
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
they were showing they were told the
 
05:12:34.128 --> 05:12:34.138 align:start position:0%
signs and symptoms of what to watch for
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
and they didn't see it so
 
05:12:38.810 --> 05:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we need to tread
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
lightly I do think our kids are
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
suffering and they do need so much help
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
but I do think that whatever you guys
 
05:12:48.770 --> 05:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
decide policy wise please just tread
 
05:12:51.490 --> 05:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
carefully and and think of the untoward
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
effects that a class taught by a teacher
 
05:12:57.530 --> 05:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
to kids who potentially have very
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
serious mental health issues what those
 
05:13:01.788 --> 05:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
implications might be
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
05:13:05.690 --> 05:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
committee representative Woodcock thank
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
you General Bud good afternoon thank you
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
just following up on representative
 
05:13:11.810 --> 05:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
Milo's uh dialogue uh in the
 
05:13:13.850 --> 05:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the way the build is written it is
 
05:13:17.930 --> 05:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
sort of uh embeds uh mental health
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
instruction or curricula in the typical
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
Health instruction classroom obviously
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
the word comprehensive is throwing us
 
05:13:28.128 --> 05:13:28.138 align:start position:0%
all off not only What that particular
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
means in this particular case that being
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
said uh I want to be sure okay are you
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
still are you advocating for or against
 
05:13:42.170 --> 05:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
basic understanding of uh issues of
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
mental health and emotional health uh is
 
05:13:47.448 --> 05:13:47.458 align:start position:0%
part of the health curriculum or you
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
advocating not to have this product
 
05:13:48.958 --> 05:13:51.830 align:start position:0%
advocating not to have this product
curriculum

05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.650 --> 05:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
I at this point this kind of leading
 
05:13:57.650 --> 05:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
to caution because there is no
 
05:14:01.128 --> 05:14:01.138 align:start position:0%
um curriculum and what what might one
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
person might think is just a basic could
 
05:14:06.110 --> 05:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
could lead to questions to more deeper
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
to more
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
um you know because what it would look
 
05:14:12.170 --> 05:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
like is you know during your Cal your
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
school year the health teacher or the
 
05:14:15.890 --> 05:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
gym teacher would have you know
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
so there would be a component on mental
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
health and what you're saying is if it's
 
05:14:23.770 --> 05:14:23.780 align:start position:0%
just grazes the the the
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
ideas you think that would I don't know
 
05:14:29.090 --> 05:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
I because I could see that going deeper
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
than just a surface
 
05:14:33.230 --> 05:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
um knowledge if that was your question
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you my concern was that
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes a lack of information is an
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
error versus no versus too much there's
 
05:14:43.730 --> 05:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
a fine line absolutely thank you thank
 
05:14:46.368 --> 05:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:14:48.530 --> 05:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:14:50.330 --> 05:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify what I think I
 
05:14:56.208 --> 05:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
heard early in your remarks
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
which seemed to be a suggestion that
 
05:15:01.010 --> 05:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
students being aware of risk factors for
 
05:15:03.170 --> 05:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
suicide would increase the risk of
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
suicide did I hear that yeah you didn't
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
hear that correctly if if a student is
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
having suicidal ideation you know and
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
say the the you know uh topic of suicide
 
05:15:16.730 --> 05:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
is addressed and talked about or
 
05:15:16.740 --> 05:15:18.430 align:start position:0%
is addressed and talked about or
whatever

05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that's going through that
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
student's mind May the may prompt it may
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
not but regardless if that student
 
05:15:29.930 --> 05:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an attempt the P the his
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
friends and his classmates may feel
 
05:15:34.128 --> 05:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
responsible whether it was related to
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
that or not it could be months later but
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're like I should have known I
 
05:15:40.670 --> 05:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
should have seen I was taught the signs
 
05:15:42.050 --> 05:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
and symptoms how come I didn't see
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Burden with that
 
05:15:47.930 --> 05:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
especially if there I feel you know we
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
all need to be aware of kids and their
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
mental health and any suicide ideation
 
05:15:56.570 --> 05:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely but to to
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
to put that to on kids again that's we
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
need to be careful we need to tread
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
carefully I may I
 
05:16:08.090 --> 05:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your further explanation I
 
05:16:09.890 --> 05:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
just want to state that I'm very
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
confident that the large body of
 
05:16:13.730 --> 05:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
evidence and mental health is that not
 
05:16:19.730 --> 05:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
I do have a question and following up on
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
that line of thinking
 
05:16:28.128 --> 05:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with nutrition and
 
05:16:29.890 --> 05:16:29.900 align:start position:0%
eating disorders
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
and we do believe that uh by a teacher
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
getting into uh talking about this topic
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
without a basic understandings of all
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
the causes and effects of that such as
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to do some fat testing in
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
the school that does that lead to
 
05:16:51.250 --> 05:16:51.260 align:start position:0%
anorexia and
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
other types of eating disorder I have
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
seen that in a middle school
 
05:17:00.530 --> 05:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
where half the girls came out with
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
anorexia or or a severe and that is a
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.050 --> 05:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
do you I hear you I think I hear you say
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
that before we engage in this we need to
 
05:17:17.330 --> 05:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a well-defined
 
05:17:17.340 --> 05:17:18.550 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a well-defined
curriculum

05:17:18.550 --> 05:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that we can stay out of the opinion
 
05:17:25.788 --> 05:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
making and in the science area of the
 
05:17:28.850 --> 05:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
subject yeah and I I would like it to be
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
presented by um if if it is adopted I
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
would like it to be taught by a
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
counselor or a social worker or the
 
05:17:39.890 --> 05:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
school psychologist as opposed to it to
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know health teacher somebody who
 
05:17:43.850 --> 05:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
can help these kids process whatever
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what's going to
 
05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
come out of their how they're going to
 
05:17:49.970 --> 05:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
perceive their lesson we can't know
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their mind and I
 
05:17:54.650 --> 05:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
would feel safer having it taught by a
 
05:17:56.448 --> 05:17:56.458 align:start position:0%
counselor social worker school
 
05:17:58.910 --> 05:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
psychologist somebody who can see and
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
help these kids process if needed you
 
05:18:03.770 --> 05:18:03.780 align:start position:0%

administrative role yeah in spite of
 
05:19:17.930 --> 05:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
this Navy New Hampshire has heard from
 
05:19:19.550 --> 05:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
several students who indicate that they
 
05:19:21.170 --> 05:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
have had zero mental health education
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
within the health education program in
 
05:19:24.530 --> 05:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
their schools and I think we can see
 
05:19:26.208 --> 05:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
that in other testimony we've heard
 
05:19:26.218 --> 05:19:26.930 align:start position:0%
that in other testimony we've heard
today

05:19:26.930 --> 05:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
by codifying these requirements HP 505
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
would ensure that every school provide
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
this critical education and reduce the
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
stigma surrounding mental health by
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%

state schools by requiring mental health

05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and we just said
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
can you explain what what it means from
 
05:20:09.770 --> 05:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
a mental health standpoint to validate
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
um mental health and mental illness uh
 
05:20:14.690 --> 05:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
um it's not a very scientific term of
 
05:20:16.920 --> 05:20:17.750 align:start position:0%
um it's not a very scientific term of
course

05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:20:17.760 --> 05:20:20.570 align:start position:0%
course
um

05:20:20.570 --> 05:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.330 --> 05:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
but in the way that we shove mental
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
health symptoms and mental health
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
discourse into uh sort of into the
 
05:20:30.050 --> 05:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
Shadows outside of uh open and
 
05:20:31.850 --> 05:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
comfortable dialogue we make the
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
children who are suffering from those
 
05:20:35.090 --> 05:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
symptoms feel as if there's something
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
wrong with them by acknowledging that it
 
05:20:39.530 --> 05:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
is a normal condition that many people
 
05:20:40.850 --> 05:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
suffer from
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
we are validating their experience and
 
05:20:44.390 --> 05:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
making them more comfortable to come
 
05:20:46.368 --> 05:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
forward and talk about it
 
05:20:49.128 --> 05:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh representative
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
Luna I didn't see you down there no
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks it was sort of a late hand
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
growing up and thanks for uh thanks for
 
05:20:58.610 --> 05:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
joining us today it's been been very
 
05:21:02.330 --> 05:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
helpful I noticed in um in one of the
 
05:21:04.850 --> 05:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
um pieces of information that went out
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
in fact I think it was from
 
05:21:10.490 --> 05:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
so it's not your testimony maybe from uh
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
Miss savini um but um but I think you
 
05:21:16.730 --> 05:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
sort of touched on it too that um in in
 
05:21:19.128 --> 05:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:21:19.138 --> 05:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

05:21:19.750 --> 05:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:22.128 --> 05:21:22.138 align:start position:0%
I guess the number of Youth reported
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
suffering from at least one major
 
05:21:26.030 --> 05:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
depressive episode in the past year is
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
about 15 percent which is um almost well
 
05:21:32.448 --> 05:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
coming on two percent maybe not quite
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
higher than the national average and
 
05:21:36.770 --> 05:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
when you see when you see shifts like
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
that from a national average that really
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
really stands out and I was wondering
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you know about what
 
05:21:46.368 --> 05:21:46.378 align:start position:0%
other states are doing in terms of
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
incorporating or folding in
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
um mental health into uh into uh um
 
05:21:55.250 --> 05:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
Wellness uh curriculum thank you for
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I absolutely agree that seeing the uh
 
05:22:00.410 --> 05:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
that rise above the national averages is
 
05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
alarming uh I'm not sure what other
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
states have been doing we didn't look
 
05:22:04.850 --> 05:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
into that in preparing this testimony
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
but we will and I'll get that would be
 
05:22:09.050 --> 05:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
great yeah thank you very much
 
05:22:11.570 --> 05:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
while you're doing that is it okay for
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
you to would you please check in and see
 
05:22:16.490 --> 05:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
who's conveying that curriculum yeah is
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
it the classroom teacher is it the gym
 
05:22:20.448 --> 05:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
teacher or is it somebody specifically
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
trained to as we've heard that to handle
 
05:22:26.810 --> 05:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
this type of uh heavy duty topic we're
 
05:22:28.690 --> 05:22:28.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely looking thank you thank you
 
05:22:33.050 --> 05:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
like further further questions yeah
 
05:22:46.850 --> 05:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I don't have any written
 
05:22:48.840 --> 05:22:50.330 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I don't have any written
testimony

05:22:50.330 --> 05:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
um again Anne-Marie Banfield parental
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
rights advocate in New Hampshire focused
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
on academic excellence and education
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose this bill
 
05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh some of you have already covered for
 
05:23:04.850 --> 05:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
the reasons so this comprehensive the
 
05:23:06.890 --> 05:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
word comprehensive is extremely
 
05:23:06.900 --> 05:23:09.170 align:start position:0%
word comprehensive is extremely
concerning

05:23:09.170 --> 05:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
05:23:09.180 --> 05:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
concerning
um

05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
I think the the nurse behind me who
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
spoke uh brought up some points that I
 
05:23:16.550 --> 05:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have brought up but
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
she covered them so I repeat them
 
05:23:22.490 --> 05:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh this would be Health curriculum this
 
05:23:25.550 --> 05:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
would be Health uh subject in the
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
subject of Health
 
05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
we have state standards in this state
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
and they are vetted and they are
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and they are put together by
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
professionals and so when I see putting
 
05:23:40.128 --> 05:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
something in like this with absolutely
 
05:23:42.410 --> 05:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
no idea what this means absolutely no
 
05:23:43.850 --> 05:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
idea what that will look like in a
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
classroom absolutely no idea what's
 
05:23:47.530 --> 05:23:47.540 align:start position:0%
going to be taught
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
then I say go to the State Board of
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
Education if you have standards that you
 
05:23:55.250 --> 05:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
would like to meet in mental health that
 
05:23:57.050 --> 05:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
our children should be learning then you
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education you
 
05:24:01.128 --> 05:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
don't come to this committee
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh that way the commissioner can decide
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
who sits on that committee and then
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully we would have mental health
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
professionals that would go through this
 
05:24:12.770 --> 05:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
and scrutinize them
 
05:24:15.650 --> 05:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
teachers are not mental health experts
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
and yet we're here we are again putting
 
05:24:19.690 --> 05:24:19.700 align:start position:0%
this on their shoulders
 
05:24:22.730 --> 05:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
often times as some of you teachers who
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
who serve know that when they bring in
 
05:24:26.448 --> 05:24:26.458 align:start position:0%
these programs they give you about eight
 
05:24:28.010 --> 05:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
hours of training and then if they throw
 
05:24:29.570 --> 05:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
you back into the classroom and now you
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
are supposed to cover these subjects
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's not your area of expertise yet this
 
05:24:38.330 --> 05:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
is extremely important I don't want you
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
to to think that because I don't want
 
05:24:43.490 --> 05:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
this put into State Statute the way it
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that this is not important in fact
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
just the opposite if you're going to do
 
05:24:50.810 --> 05:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
something like this you better make sure
 
05:24:53.208 --> 05:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
that there's a child psychologist PhD
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
level who has clinical training
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
and education
 
05:25:00.650 --> 05:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
in every school in this state because
 
05:25:02.570 --> 05:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
they need to be overseeing something
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
like this
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
says the the the
 
05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
um presenter said that this is a
 
05:25:08.580 --> 05:25:09.890 align:start position:0%
um presenter said that this is a
priority

05:25:09.890 --> 05:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
priority
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
it's a priority that's why they wanted
 
05:25:14.930 --> 05:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
it this isn't State Statute so removing
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
something like this if this goes wrong
 
05:25:20.030 --> 05:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
becomes impossible
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
we have social emotional learning in the
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
school right now and we're finding
 
05:25:26.570 --> 05:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
problems with that we're finding
 
05:25:29.570 --> 05:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
problems with mental health
 
05:25:32.810 --> 05:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
programs being brought into the school
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
group therapy in classrooms and parents
 
05:25:38.330 --> 05:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
haven't consented
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
we're in this bill does it say anything
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
about what this is going to look like
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
and will parents be allowed to consent
 
05:25:49.128 --> 05:25:49.138 align:start position:0%
as they should per essay there is a
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
provision in there that requires
 
05:25:52.250 --> 05:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
parental consent when there's any
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
assessment or mental health services
 
05:25:58.250 --> 05:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.650 --> 05:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
so what does this look like
 
05:26:03.170 --> 05:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
um first of all I want to bring up the
 
05:26:05.390 --> 05:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
school shutdowns that is one of the
 
05:26:08.090 --> 05:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
biggest proponents of mental health
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
problems amongst our students brought to
 
05:26:16.190 --> 05:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:19.970 --> 05:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just bring a couple more
 
05:26:21.480 --> 05:26:22.788 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just bring a couple more
points

05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
points
 
05:26:24.830 --> 05:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I know that some of you have seen
 
05:26:26.510 --> 05:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
this video because I've sent it to some
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
of you in the past
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
in Columbine where there was the school
 
05:26:33.050 --> 05:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
shootings there was something that they
 
05:26:35.150 --> 05:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
called deaf education several years ago
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
they were concerned about the mental
 
05:26:39.050 --> 05:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
health of their kids too so they decided
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
to Let's talk about
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
death and suicide to help the students
 
05:26:46.610 --> 05:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
and they covered this on a program
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
called 2020 and you can go back it's on
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
the it's on the um that's on YouTube and
 
05:26:52.730 --> 05:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of you have seen it and if
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
you haven't I've sent it to you so you
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
should have seen it
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
and so what they did is they brought in
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to talk to the kids about death
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so they started interviewing the the
 
05:27:06.050 --> 05:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
person from 2020 interviewed some of the
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
kids in the class
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
and how it began to make them start
 
05:27:12.850 --> 05:27:12.860 align:start position:0%
thinking about suicide
 
05:27:16.730 --> 05:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
and so where they were trying to prevent
 
05:27:19.730 --> 05:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
they were actually doing harm to these
 
05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
children who's liable for that
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
acts out in that way who's liable for
 
05:27:29.390 --> 05:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
that what about liability
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
um you brought up the Eating Disorders
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
in schools there was an article not too
 
05:27:37.010 --> 05:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
long ago and sorry but it was one of the
 
05:27:39.288 --> 05:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
housewives one of the women who who's a
 
05:27:42.350 --> 05:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
housewife on TV one of those shows and
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
she talked about how she was a bulimic
 
05:27:46.128 --> 05:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
and still struggles today and where did
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
she learn about it she says in school
 
05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
so if you have somebody who doesn't
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
understand the impact that they are
 
05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
having on these children teaching and
 
05:28:00.110 --> 05:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
covering these subjects you may be doing
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
them very serious harm very serious harm
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
and that's I'm sure what everybody in
 
05:28:08.750 --> 05:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
this probably room wants to avoid
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
so without that that detailed
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
information I could never support
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
something like this and again I would
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
hope that if this is turned down that
 
05:28:22.850 --> 05:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
maybe this is taken to the commissioner
 
05:28:25.128 --> 05:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
and we look at standards that can be
 
05:28:28.490 --> 05:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and looked at and vetted and
 
05:28:30.530 --> 05:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
debated once they are released to the
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
public so I can look at him as a parent
 
05:28:34.128 --> 05:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
we can look at them as mental health
 
05:28:36.170 --> 05:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
professionals and determine whether it's
 
05:28:36.180 --> 05:28:38.150 align:start position:0%
professionals and determine whether it's
appropriate

05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:28:38.160 --> 05:28:38.868 align:start position:0%
appropriate
um

05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
one last point
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
this cause this costs resources this is
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
resources that we will be expending on
 
05:28:45.240 --> 05:28:46.368 align:start position:0%

is one other health related program I am
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
aware of that uses the word
 
05:29:43.550 --> 05:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in the title and it's
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%

speak to that at all and what's what
involves

05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
involves
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I don't think that's on on
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
topic here we're talking about
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental Health not sex ed
 
05:30:02.330 --> 05:30:02.340 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:30:20.208 --> 05:30:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay good morning afternoon
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Olivia Cheney I'm a junior at
 
05:30:28.970 --> 05:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
Bedford High School and I am here to
 
05:30:32.810 --> 05:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
testify in support of hb505. mental
 
05:30:36.050 --> 05:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
illness runs in my family and I suffered
 
05:30:39.948 --> 05:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
greatly from a couple of things
 
05:30:43.368 --> 05:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know much about mental
 
05:30:45.410 --> 05:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
illness I've attended multiple mental
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
health recovery oriented programs
 
05:30:50.448 --> 05:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
but I still feel like I know nothing
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
I've heard people talk about the darkest
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
corners of their minds I've been to
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
programs where I was learning about
 
05:30:59.570 --> 05:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
mental health six hours every day for
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
months straight and yet my understanding
 
05:31:04.368 --> 05:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
of it as a broad topic is hollow and
 
05:31:06.890 --> 05:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
unfulfilling so I wonder how lost those
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
who don't have the same history as me
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
feel I wonder if they feel isolated I
 
05:31:14.330 --> 05:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
wonder if they cry at night
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of people diagnosed with
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
depression in New Hampshire are in high
 
05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
school according to the cdc's risk
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
factor surveillance system
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
with a majority demographic being in
 
05:31:24.890 --> 05:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
high school it's most effective to
 
05:31:26.570 --> 05:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
provide mental health education to high
 
05:31:28.850 --> 05:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
school students this is a prime time to
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
develop empathy for our peers via
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
education mental illness is dysfunction
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the brain and can be hard for others
 
05:31:38.090 --> 05:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
to understand the opportunity to enforce
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
a mental health curriculum is the
 
05:31:41.930 --> 05:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to stretch empathy Beyond
 
05:31:44.690 --> 05:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
just what you have experienced mental
 
05:31:46.490 --> 05:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
health education could teach students
 
05:31:48.050 --> 05:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
how to talk to someone when they're
 
05:31:50.448 --> 05:31:50.458 align:start position:0%
angry or about accountability or
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
self-regulation or how to ask someone
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
for help the list can go on and on
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
mental health education does not need to
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
be confined to mental illness it can
 
05:32:01.550 --> 05:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
give students the foundation to move
 
05:32:04.368 --> 05:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
into adulthood confidently and safely
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago I had an episode
 
05:32:08.690 --> 05:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
where I could physically felt all of my
 
05:32:10.490 --> 05:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
thoughts filling up my head pressing
 
05:32:12.530 --> 05:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
against my skull and I didn't know what
 
05:32:15.288 --> 05:32:15.298 align:start position:0%
to do I was scared I was irrational I
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
was in pain I was ultimately sent to the
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
ER but by the time I spoke to the
 
05:32:21.708 --> 05:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist there I was caught I calmed
 
05:32:24.890 --> 05:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
down I was ashamed I had just wasted so
 
05:32:27.170 --> 05:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
many people's time and effort the
 
05:32:28.970 --> 05:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist recommended I go to a
 
05:32:31.750 --> 05:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
behavioral center this Behavioral Center
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on children who were
 
05:32:37.368 --> 05:32:37.378 align:start position:0%
getting in fights in school or involved
 
05:32:39.288 --> 05:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
in drugs so it was not equipped to
 
05:32:41.570 --> 05:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
properly treat mental health it served
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
no purpose in my recovery
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
prior to my episode I was never taught
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
what options I had I didn't know how
 
05:32:51.288 --> 05:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
mental illness could affect my body I
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
didn't I never knew that I was capable
 
05:32:55.788 --> 05:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
of feeling like I did I was never taught
 
05:32:58.448 --> 05:32:58.458 align:start position:0%
how Unapologetic mental illness can be
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
if I had more knowledge I could have
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
made a smarter Choice than going to the
 
05:33:04.970 --> 05:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
ER that's not what I should have done
 
05:33:07.310 --> 05:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
that day but I was never told what else
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:33:10.970 --> 05:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
in school we learned I've learned about
 
05:33:12.530 --> 05:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
different mental illnesses in health
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
class we learned how to identify things
 
05:33:18.288 --> 05:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
like schizophrenia bulimia or anxiety
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't learn what to do when someone's
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
having a panic attack or a delusional
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
episode or even how to build a proper
 
05:33:26.448 --> 05:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
support system
 
05:33:28.190 --> 05:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
if schools don't tell us this thing
 
05:33:30.050 --> 05:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
these things who will
 
05:33:32.448 --> 05:33:32.458 align:start position:0%
do I have to be in crisis to receive
 
05:33:32.458 --> 05:33:35.868 align:start position:0%
do I have to be in crisis to receive
support

05:33:35.868 --> 05:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there there are
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:33:42.110 --> 05:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps in woodcock
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask you if you
 
05:33:48.530 --> 05:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
had any of any basic Construction in
 
05:33:49.850 --> 05:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
probably the health curricula which you
 
05:33:52.090 --> 05:33:52.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was some there
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
do you know if in terms of the health
 
05:33:58.670 --> 05:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh in bed so obviously also
 
05:34:01.550 --> 05:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
the high school at Bedford High is this
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
by a regular health teacher or typically
 
05:34:07.610 --> 05:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
my summer program a regular health
 
05:34:09.650 --> 05:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
teacher and at Bedford High School
 
05:34:11.570 --> 05:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
health and physical education classes
 
05:34:14.330 --> 05:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
are by one teacher okay so you're you're
 
05:34:14.340 --> 05:34:16.208 align:start position:0%
are by one teacher okay so you're you're
thinking

05:34:16.208 --> 05:34:16.218 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:34:18.830 --> 05:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
is then that the program that's embedded
 
05:34:20.570 --> 05:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
now in the curriculum should be expanded
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
more to give more information to the
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
students yeah more so about as it says
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%

05:35:25.368 --> 05:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that's close to my
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
heart as I have seen the impact that
 
05:35:30.650 --> 05:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
limited health education can have on
 
05:35:31.730 --> 05:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
young people
 
05:35:33.530 --> 05:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
as a member of the governor's youth
 
05:35:35.690 --> 05:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
advisory Council on substance misuse and
 
05:35:37.850 --> 05:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
prevention I have had the opportunity to
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
collaborate with organizations and
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
leaders all over New Hampshire to tackle
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
this issue of substance abuse among the
 
05:35:43.920 --> 05:35:44.868 align:start position:0%
this issue of substance abuse among the
youths

05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
youths
 
05:35:46.850 --> 05:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
Pro work we have discovered the shortage
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
of mental health education in the state
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
leading the G act to advocate for this
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
bill this bill will greatly improve
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
students access to the Vital Information
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
they need for the mental well-being and
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
would help to address the growing need
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
for comprehensive mental health
 
05:36:03.410 --> 05:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
education in our schools
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
during my high school years I had the
 
05:36:07.010 --> 05:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take my health class
 
05:36:09.050 --> 05:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
online but I was disappointed to find a
 
05:36:11.150 --> 05:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
lack of emphasis on Substance Abuse and
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
these are topics that are vital for
 
05:36:15.650 --> 05:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
young people today and are often
 
05:36:17.570 --> 05:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
overlooked in the current curriculum the
 
05:36:20.448 --> 05:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
lack of education on these subjects can
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
lead to dangerous consequences for
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
students later on in life which is why I
 
05:36:25.850 --> 05:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
took the initiative to research more on
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
my own but I noticed that many of my
 
05:36:30.288 --> 05:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
peers did not do the same
 
05:36:33.530 --> 05:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
pandemic has only heightened the need
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
for a comprehensive mental health
 
05:36:39.470 --> 05:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
education in our schools with mental
 
05:36:41.330 --> 05:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
health struggles On The Rise as the
 
05:36:43.010 --> 05:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
other people have mentioned it is more
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
important than ever for high schools to
 
05:36:47.030 --> 05:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
receive education and access to
 
05:36:50.330 --> 05:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
resources to navigate these challenges
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
the current curriculum High School only
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
requires one health class for a quarter
 
05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
of the year over all four years uh which
 
05:36:58.850 --> 05:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
is simply not enough time for to provide
 
05:37:00.050 --> 05:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
students with Comprehensive
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of these topics
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I strongly urge the
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee to support HP 505
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education is
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
vital for high school students and will
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
provide them with the information they
 
05:37:12.770 --> 05:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
need to succeed in high school and
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
Beyond by supporting this bill you will
 
05:37:16.610 --> 05:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
be giving tools tools they need to make
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about their mental
 
05:37:20.448 --> 05:37:20.458 align:start position:0%
well-being and navigate the challenges
 
05:37:22.250 --> 05:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
that I had thank you for your time
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you are there reps
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
in woodcock
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good afternoon how
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
you doing how are you fine thank
 
05:37:31.490 --> 05:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
you a couple quick questions just so I
 
05:37:33.410 --> 05:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
may have about your online course but
 
05:37:34.970 --> 05:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
was that a curriculum from the high
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
school or was that a separate curriculum
 
05:37:38.690 --> 05:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I took it on vlax it was
 
05:37:40.128 --> 05:37:40.138 align:start position:0%
Health opportunities and physical
 
05:37:42.770 --> 05:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
education it was uh and kind of just a
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that uh from that class was
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
interacting with an instructor or was
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
just uh uh information I had a velox
 
05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
instructor but the thing is most of the
 
05:37:53.690 --> 05:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
work is done by yourself so you just
 
05:37:55.490 --> 05:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
occasionally have a few check-ins but
 
05:37:57.470 --> 05:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it wasn't really the same as a
 
05:38:00.050 --> 05:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
proper uh in school education okay the
 
05:38:01.490 --> 05:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
reality is that most of the people at my
 
05:38:03.230 --> 05:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
school are taking online so they're
 
05:38:04.610 --> 05:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
getting probably similar experience to
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
me um I took some research from running
 
05:38:07.970 --> 05:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
on but most of my peers did not do the
 
05:38:09.890 --> 05:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
same okay thank you so much thank you
 
05:38:11.448 --> 05:38:11.458 align:start position:0%
representative a good question for you
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
then following up to represent Woodcock
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important
 
05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
important part is this the type of
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
subject that should be done online or
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
something that should be done with
 
05:38:22.368 --> 05:38:22.378 align:start position:0%
another human body in the classroom with
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
you instructor yeah I think in person
 
05:38:25.730 --> 05:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's going to give a much better
 
05:38:27.770 --> 05:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
educational experience when it's online
 
05:38:29.288 --> 05:38:29.298 align:start position:0%
you're just kind of reading articles
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
typing a stuff by yourself you don't
 
05:38:32.448 --> 05:38:32.458 align:start position:0%
really get to see you don't really get
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
as much out of the curriculum as you
 
05:38:35.330 --> 05:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
would if you are sitting in a classroom
 
05:38:39.050 --> 05:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
and learning thank you further questions
 
05:38:41.570 --> 05:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much
 
05:38:50.330 --> 05:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
understood three you know this one right
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
here just there's four people can't rely
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
05:39:00.530 --> 05:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Lily O'Brien and
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a junior at Plymouth Regional High
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
School in Plymouth I'm here to testify
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
in support of hb505 it is important that
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
we create a community where young people
 
05:39:10.730 --> 05:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
and students can build a positive future
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
for themselves which is why it is
 
05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
critical that this legislation is passed
 
05:39:15.890 --> 05:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we are granted the
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
education we deserve I have attended New
 
05:39:20.030 --> 05:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools for my entire
 
05:39:21.890 --> 05:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
life and have experienced firsthand the
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
effects that mental illness has had on
 
05:39:25.730 --> 05:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
my peers and Community our education
 
05:39:27.708 --> 05:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
laws and policies serve the purpose of
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
meeting the educational needs of all
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
students yet we're still without mental
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
health education much to us education on
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
prevention strategies and response
 
05:39:37.368 --> 05:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
methods this is a grave disservice to
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
the students of New Hampshire it is of
 
05:39:41.090 --> 05:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
the utmost importance that students are
 
05:39:42.650 --> 05:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
equipped with the proper knowledge to
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
handle situations impacting and
 
05:39:46.070 --> 05:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
affecting their mental health that they
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
are highly susceptible to
 
05:39:50.208 --> 05:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
within my own Community I have seen many
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
of my friends struggle with their mental
 
05:39:53.570 --> 05:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
health myself included
 
05:39:55.310 --> 05:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
stressors that come from a multitude of
 
05:39:56.990 --> 05:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
factors that include schoolwork social
 
05:39:59.150 --> 05:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
engagement and many more are only making
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
it worse
 
05:40:02.448 --> 05:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
I've watched my friends fall away from
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
whom I've always known them as becoming
 
05:40:05.810 --> 05:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
yet another statistic charting teen
 
05:40:07.550 --> 05:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
self-harm or eating disorders within the
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
youth population
 
05:40:10.910 --> 05:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
we attend school each day for five days
 
05:40:12.890 --> 05:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
a week and yet the only health education
 
05:40:14.570 --> 05:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
we've received has been a semester-long
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
course in our freshman year that covered
 
05:40:18.050 --> 05:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
the surface of physical health and
 
05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
social well-being mental illness is a
 
05:40:21.770 --> 05:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
very real topic that has become
 
05:40:23.208 --> 05:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
increasingly prevalent in youth
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
populations and we are still yet to
 
05:40:27.050 --> 05:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
receive education on it my friends and
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
classmates have been grappling with
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
these situations and are unprepared to
 
05:40:30.890 --> 05:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
handle them
 
05:40:33.530 --> 05:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
this issue has also severely affected my
 
05:40:35.448 --> 05:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
school community and my school has tried
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
to solve it through motivational
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
speakers lunch initiatives allotted
 
05:40:40.610 --> 05:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
mindfulness walks and many other methods
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
but to no avail
 
05:40:43.850 --> 05:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed mental health
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
education would be streamlined and
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
normalized in conversation and my
 
05:40:49.128 --> 05:40:49.138 align:start position:0%
friends peers and every other student in
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would be able
 
05:40:52.250 --> 05:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
to gain the necessary knowledge to
 
05:40:53.930 --> 05:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
handle these situations and be equipped
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
to respond to them this legislation
 
05:40:57.470 --> 05:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
would act as a preventative step for
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
health care so that our only medical
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
treatment for mental health wouldn't be
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to the emergency room as a last
 
05:41:04.550 --> 05:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
resort investing in preventative Mental
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care is important so we can
 
05:41:07.850 --> 05:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
respond to mental health concerns before
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
they reach the point of life or death
 
05:41:10.850 --> 05:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
which is something that I've sadly had
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with one too many times
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have an endless amount of resources
 
05:41:16.550 --> 05:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and we must utilize them this is an
 
05:41:18.590 --> 05:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to prevent and decrease the
 
05:41:20.208 --> 05:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
high rates of mental illness amongst
 
05:41:21.410 --> 05:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
young people that is always being
 
05:41:23.810 --> 05:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
observed and reported but never acted
 
05:41:26.690 --> 05:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
upon we are your future the students and
 
05:41:28.128 --> 05:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
teens are the people of the state who
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
will be stepping up to lead in the
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
coming years it is in our best interest
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
to act upon these issues now in order to
 
05:41:35.330 --> 05:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
equip students with the resources we
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
need to ensure a strong and successful
 
05:41:39.470 --> 05:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
future I urge you to support us your
 
05:41:41.448 --> 05:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
students and your youth by supporting HP
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
505 thank you thank you
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:41:49.150 --> 05:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much
 
05:42:01.550 --> 05:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me my name
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
is Betsy Harrington I'm from Deering I'm
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
a therapist I've been a therapist for
 
05:42:10.490 --> 05:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
over 20 years and you're probably going
 
05:42:12.288 --> 05:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
to be surprised to hear me say that I do
 
05:42:14.270 --> 05:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
not support this bill
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think that we should
 
05:42:19.010 --> 05:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
be increasing Mental Health and Medical
 
05:42:21.830 --> 05:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
in our schools I feel like if it relates
 
05:42:24.650 --> 05:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
to education then I think we should be
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
taking that on in the school but
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you're going to take on
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
mental health issues of children that
 
05:42:32.690 --> 05:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
are not related to school there are huge
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
liabilities like as a therapist I just
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
think to myself what if somebody accuses
 
05:42:39.770 --> 05:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
you of something
 
05:42:43.550 --> 05:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
my school has 75 000 assigned each year
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
for like legal costs related to these
 
05:42:48.410 --> 05:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that's not enough it's
 
05:42:50.208 --> 05:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
not going to be enough if we get sued
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
for something that we did wrong so I
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
feel like the more you put these
 
05:42:59.708 --> 05:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
Outside Agency type things into a school
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
the more problems we potentially have I
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
think if kids have insurance Medicaid
 
05:43:06.890 --> 05:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
things like that they should be going to
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Center like
 
05:43:10.610 --> 05:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
everybody else with their parents not
 
05:43:13.128 --> 05:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
during school time remember you had to
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
take kids out of class
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
to do these groups there's already
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
Health they the kids were always saying
 
05:43:23.530 --> 05:43:23.540 align:start position:0%
that they get a quarter a semester of
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
Health maybe we should increase the
 
05:43:29.330 --> 05:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
health time to something more do we have
 
05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
to put in a new program that creates
 
05:43:34.550 --> 05:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
more liabilities and more issues when we
 
05:43:37.070 --> 05:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a program that already exists we
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
can make that one better we don't need
 
05:43:41.690 --> 05:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
the liability of adding new services
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
that then take on who knows if that
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
therapist was inappropriate If the
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
parents didn't like the way they did it
 
05:43:51.650 --> 05:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
I feel like we're getting into a place
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
that puts us at such liability it's
 
05:43:56.208 --> 05:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
really not a great idea I think if it's
 
05:43:58.850 --> 05:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
related to their schooling so it's going
 
05:44:01.310 --> 05:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
to be on their IEP or their 504 plan
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
then it might make sense to do some
 
05:44:05.330 --> 05:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
counseling because you want them to
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
attend school you want them to do their
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
best but if it's not about school let's
 
05:44:11.330 --> 05:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
say it's just depression about something
 
05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
else you should be going to the mental
 
05:44:14.570 --> 05:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
health center
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
and you know seeing a psychiatrist and
 
05:44:18.530 --> 05:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know maybe having mom go with you so
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
you've got that conversation time on the
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
way there I feel like it really leaves
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
the parents out when you start to put
 
05:44:25.850 --> 05:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
all these programs into the school that
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
the parents aren't aware of have been
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
approved of I really look at all the
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum that my kids get and I can
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
tell you A lot of it I say no to because
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
I find it inappropriate so I guess I'd
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
really have to see this ahead of time
 
05:44:41.208 --> 05:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
and wonder why it's just not included in
 
05:44:43.070 --> 05:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
the current health class
 
05:44:47.690 --> 05:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.730 --> 05:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:05.448 --> 05:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.010 --> 05:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
all right so my name is Abby Cade and
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior at Bedford High School I'm
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
in the town of Bedford obviously
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
um I also serve as a student
 
05:45:13.128 --> 05:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative on the Bedford school
 
05:45:14.930 --> 05:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
board however I am here to represent
 
05:45:14.940 --> 05:45:15.948 align:start position:0%
board however I am here to represent
myself

05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of House
 
05:45:20.090 --> 05:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 505 a comprehensive mental health
 
05:45:22.490 --> 05:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
education curriculum in is a necessity
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Public Schools
 
05:45:25.610 --> 05:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a minute to discuss
 
05:45:27.890 --> 05:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
what the word comprehensive means to me
 
05:45:29.990 --> 05:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in my definition means a
 
05:45:32.208 --> 05:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
complete including all or nearly all
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
elements or aspects of something
 
05:45:35.448 --> 05:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
this to me means talking about
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
everything from warning signs to the
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
actual disorders to the resources that
 
05:45:41.930 --> 05:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
are available such as like The Suicide
 
05:45:43.548 --> 05:45:43.558 align:start position:0%
Prevention Hotline or the mental health
 
05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
hotlines which I know a lot of schools
 
05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
are putting on their websites now but
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
they aren't actually being told about
 
05:45:52.610 --> 05:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
students on six plus hours at school
 
05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
five days a week
 
05:45:56.690 --> 05:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
if we think about a normal nine-to-five
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
working job students between school and
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
homework and sports are spending that
 
05:46:03.410 --> 05:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
much time using their brains as well
 
05:46:05.750 --> 05:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
this can become incredibly mentally
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
draining I know through the course of my
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
high school career I myself plus a lot
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
of my peers have simply not come to
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
school because we just need to sleep we
 
05:46:18.530 --> 05:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
I can say that being in school and
 
05:46:21.230 --> 05:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
navigating the stress of test
 
05:46:23.090 --> 05:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
assignments and heavy workloads plus the
 
05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
social aspects of school can take a toll
 
05:46:26.628 --> 05:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
on anyone's Mental Health
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
I know Nami smoke spoke but I do have a
 
05:46:31.610 --> 05:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
um quote from them untreated
 
05:46:33.170 --> 05:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
inadequately treated mental illness can
 
05:46:34.490 --> 05:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
lead to high rates of school dropout
 
05:46:36.170 --> 05:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
unemployment substance use arrest
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
incarceration and early death suicide is
 
05:46:41.570 --> 05:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
also the second leading cause of death
 
05:46:44.090 --> 05:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
for youth ages 10 to 34.
 
05:46:45.530 --> 05:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
so I ask
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
why if mental health is one of the
 
05:46:50.090 --> 05:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
biggest factors affecting Generation Z
 
05:46:52.250 --> 05:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
are we not doing something about it why
 
05:46:53.930 --> 05:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
if schools are the place where
 
05:46:55.850 --> 05:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
Generation Z is spending the most time
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
are we not changing something in our
 
05:46:58.320 --> 05:47:00.288 align:start position:0%
are we not changing something in our
schools

05:47:00.288 --> 05:47:00.298 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
with mental health being one of the
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
biggest factors in this we deserve to
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
learn about it imagine how many lives
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
could be saved if someone had just
 
05:47:10.970 --> 05:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
noticed the signs teaching about mental
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
health encouraging students to take to
 
05:47:14.930 --> 05:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
talk and take a break
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
and learn about how they're feeling it
 
05:47:18.770 --> 05:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
provides a better understanding of how
 
05:47:20.090 --> 05:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
mental illness can affect a person's
 
05:47:20.100 --> 05:47:20.930 align:start position:0%
mental illness can affect a person's
life

05:47:20.930 --> 05:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
it can help to reduce stigma which let
 
05:47:25.010 --> 05:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
me tell you there's a huge stigma around
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
mental health right now
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
it can give competence to ask for help
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
or help those who are suffering it also
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
encourages early intervention by
 
05:47:34.850 --> 05:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
recognizing early signs and risk of
 
05:47:36.770 --> 05:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
mental health because like the others
 
05:47:38.330 --> 05:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
have said why wait for us to be in
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
crisis before we intervene
 
05:47:41.930 --> 05:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
the reality is this issue cannot be
 
05:47:43.788 --> 05:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
ignored any longer how can we sit here
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
in contempt at the cries from students
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
and Educators to change things at our
 
05:47:46.378 --> 05:47:47.270 align:start position:0%
and Educators to change things at our
schools

05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
today I'm angry today I'm I am upset
 
05:47:53.810 --> 05:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
because I do not want my peers or myself
 
05:47:56.150 --> 05:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
to suffer any longer and I think that
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
this early intervention mental health
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
curriculum would greatly help that
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
we must do right by the Youth of New
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and with that I urge the
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee to vote ought to pass on HP
 
05:48:07.250 --> 05:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
505 thank you for the time and I will
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
05:48:10.490 --> 05:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
05:48:10.500 --> 05:48:11.628 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
woodcock

05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
05:48:14.930 --> 05:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you my question
 
05:48:16.610 --> 05:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
um of course during the course of your
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned that you you're
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
pretty wound up after a long week and
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
you took a day out of school and that if
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
I may get suspected bill right before
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
lunch uh with HP 359 was talking about
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
the need for students to be able to if I
 
05:48:31.610 --> 05:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
may representative the need for students
 
05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a option at some
 
05:48:35.770 --> 05:48:35.780 align:start position:0%
point for a mental health day or a
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
behavioral health day for themselves
 
05:48:40.310 --> 05:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
um obviously we're assuming with this
 
05:48:42.890 --> 05:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
Paris knowing that Rogers downtown
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
um you or your uh is a school board rep
 
05:48:48.048 --> 05:48:48.058 align:start position:0%
are you feeling is that something that'd
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
be useful
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
um because this bill is having a high
 
05:48:52.250 --> 05:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
time as you can see already because the
 
05:48:54.250 --> 05:48:54.260 align:start position:0%
world coffee has those types of
 
05:48:56.990 --> 05:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
subsidiary bills like the option to give
 
05:48:59.510 --> 05:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
kids uh some of the time is that
 
05:49:00.590 --> 05:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
something to be acceptable not
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable in a little while but as an
 
05:49:02.280 --> 05:49:03.110 align:start position:0%
acceptable in a little while but as an
addition

05:49:03.110 --> 05:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
addition
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think with the talk about
 
05:49:07.128 --> 05:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
mental health in schools there's a lot
 
05:49:08.930 --> 05:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
of things that are in my opinion wrong
 
05:49:10.730 --> 05:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
with the school system right now and I
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
think that with a bill like this with
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
mental health curriculum
 
05:49:16.490 --> 05:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
attacks the um aspect of trying to
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
reduce the people who are already in
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
crisis in the actual like issues that
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
are already up like that but as far as
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill you're referring before about
 
05:49:26.090 --> 05:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
the mental health um as like a absence
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
from school I would be in support of
 
05:49:30.288 --> 05:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's a great idea I
 
05:49:31.730 --> 05:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
do know that like as a school board
 
05:49:33.770 --> 05:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative um I do know that there
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
are a certain amount of like days that
 
05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
students have to be in school that like
 
05:49:38.030 --> 05:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
the district has to provide so it would
 
05:49:40.190 --> 05:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
be something that had to be like worked
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
out with like calendars and stuff um so
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
I know that that is a bigger issue but I
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
do think with something like this that
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
can even be the first step in bigger
 
05:49:50.448 --> 05:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
topics like mental health days things
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
like that thank you thank you thank you
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
representation you're welcome thank you
 
05:49:56.570 --> 05:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
very much are the further questions
 
05:49:58.368 --> 05:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:05.930 --> 05:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
to East Cornell out in New Hampshire I
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
know we're running behind and I'm going
 
05:50:10.850 --> 05:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
to go very quickly I think we're at a
 
05:50:13.368 --> 05:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
Crossroads I love these Youth and I hope
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
that these you will connect with me
 
05:50:16.490 --> 05:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
afterwards because what I see every two
 
05:50:18.048 --> 05:50:18.058 align:start position:0%
weeks at the executive council meeting
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
is a half a billion dollars going for
 
05:50:24.288 --> 05:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
things like resources for mental health
 
05:50:26.690 --> 05:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
but yeah as a registered nurse I'm
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
seeing people wait up to a year to get
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
into a psychiatrist to get the
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
medications their brain needs to
 
05:50:35.390 --> 05:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
function appropriately we have a mental
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
health crisis in New Hampshire Bar None
 
05:50:40.730 --> 05:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
unlike anything ever I've ever seen in
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
worse than most States it has to be
 
05:50:45.230 --> 05:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with but yet we have a half a
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
billion dollars that goes through that
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
room in two hours every two weeks to
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS for a mobile crisis 1-800 clinic to
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
get to these kids when they need them
 
05:50:56.930 --> 05:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
and they go to their guidance counselor
 
05:51:00.410 --> 05:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
who's not got a PhD in psychiatry
 
05:51:02.810 --> 05:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
we have to decide as an education
 
05:51:06.470 --> 05:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee what does that what is that
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
what are we here to do for education
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
if our test scores are horrible and our
 
05:51:13.548 --> 05:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
kids are not reading or doing a rhythm
 
05:51:15.770 --> 05:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
attack or able to get out and write a
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
resume and do the basic fundamentals of
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
Education if we spread ourselves Way Too
 
05:51:24.048 --> 05:51:24.058 align:start position:0%
Thin and there is a lot of crossover
 
05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be effective anywhere
 
05:51:27.890 --> 05:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're at already
 
05:51:29.750 --> 05:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do health care we're
 
05:51:32.170 --> 05:51:32.180 align:start position:0%
trying to do you know comprehensive
 
05:51:34.010 --> 05:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care
 
05:51:35.930 --> 05:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
and yeah our test scores and I'm hearing
 
05:51:37.250 --> 05:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony we don't have
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
enough money for Perez
 
05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
like we don't have enough money to do
 
05:51:43.250 --> 05:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
the basics and now we're going to spread
 
05:51:45.410 --> 05:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
ourselves thinner what I would love to
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
see these kids do with me if they've got
 
05:51:48.890 --> 05:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
their righteous anger like I do and I'm
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
hearing it from them and rightfully so
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
as they partner with me and we start
 
05:51:54.170 --> 05:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
going down that rabbit show and
 
05:51:55.970 --> 05:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
investigating where is that half a
 
05:51:58.128 --> 05:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
billion dollars going that I'm seeing
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
going through that executive council
 
05:52:00.890 --> 05:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
meeting every two weeks because it's
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to Hampton and if
 
05:52:04.010 --> 05:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to shut down this new news
 
05:52:04.970 --> 05:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
center we're not going to do something
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
good with it only to build another
 
05:52:06.240 --> 05:52:07.430 align:start position:0%
good with it only to build another
something

05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
like that's where we need to all get in
 
05:52:12.288 --> 05:52:12.298 align:start position:0%
the game here and start asking the
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions because the money is not
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
getting to these kids
 
05:52:19.128 --> 05:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
it is not a new legislation is not going
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
to cause that to start to fix the
 
05:52:23.150 --> 05:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
problem and we have seen too many kids
 
05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
commit suicide these kids have been
 
05:52:25.260 --> 05:52:26.628 align:start position:0%
commit suicide these kids have been
wrecked

05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
wrecked
 
05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
through US sending them home during
 
05:52:28.200 --> 05:52:29.690 align:start position:0%
through US sending them home during
covid

05:52:29.690 --> 05:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
covid
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're going through so much through
 
05:52:33.410 --> 05:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
social media they're living in pressures
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
we never experienced as children and we
 
05:52:38.330 --> 05:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
do need to step up for them but I don't
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
think spreading education to do both
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
health care psychiatric care this and
 
05:52:45.650 --> 05:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
that yes they're there for the majority
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
of their day and yes these kids maybe go
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
home to a home life but there's not
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
someone there to facilitate it but I'd
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
much rather see the resource go to their
 
05:52:54.410 --> 05:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor who picks up that
 
05:52:56.330 --> 05:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
1-800 number for that mobile clinic with
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
Riverbend and they have someone right
 
05:52:59.570 --> 05:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
then and there to spend time with that
 
05:53:01.610 --> 05:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
child for a few hours after school who's
 
05:53:03.890 --> 05:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
a professional doctorate trained
 
05:53:05.690 --> 05:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
individual to make sure that child truly
 
05:53:07.250 --> 05:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
gets what they need and that we have a
 
05:53:08.810 --> 05:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
bed available for them in Hampton and
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
they don't sit for three weeks and the
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
yellow POD at Concord Hospital
 
05:53:15.530 --> 05:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
that does them no good these kids are
 
05:53:17.150 --> 05:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely right about that but it does
 
05:53:18.650 --> 05:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
not belong in within the scope of our
 
05:53:18.660 --> 05:53:19.970 align:start position:0%
not belong in within the scope of our
education

05:53:19.970 --> 05:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I am opposed to this
 
05:53:24.048 --> 05:53:24.058 align:start position:0%
within our Public Schools thank you for
 
05:53:25.610 --> 05:53:25.620 align:start position:0%

thank you and with that I'm going to
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%

05:53:37.740 --> 05:53:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:53:40.750 --> 05:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:45.230 --> 05:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
we only have one card here 517 that's
 
05:53:48.708 --> 05:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:48.718 --> 05:53:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay

okay
yes

so why don't you just introduce it and
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
let them speak to a week and he died in
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
a minute yeah that's yeah so we have it
 
05:54:01.850 --> 05:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
knocked off and off the schedule of the
 
05:54:01.860 --> 05:54:04.810 align:start position:0%
knocked off and off the schedule of the
end

05:54:04.810 --> 05:54:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:09.288 --> 05:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:09.298 --> 05:54:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:54:14.030 --> 05:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.040 --> 05:54:18.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:54:18.250 --> 05:54:18.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
this bill which we have we don't have
 
05:54:23.448 --> 05:54:23.458 align:start position:0%
anybody speaking 517 so we're going to
 
05:54:27.770 --> 05:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.780 --> 05:54:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
actually

05:54:32.110 --> 05:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.090 --> 05:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
before everybody gets hits the road we
 
05:54:36.650 --> 05:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
want to thank all our students who took
 
05:54:38.510 --> 05:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
the time out today to
 
05:54:54.490 --> 05:54:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:00.490 --> 05:55:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.490 --> 05:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
I got it yeah no she's always part of
 
05:55:06.890 --> 05:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
this education in fact she was in that
 
05:55:09.650 --> 05:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
first class of names I may call it but
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
she does
 
05:55:11.520 --> 05:55:43.850 align:start position:0%
she does
applications

05:55:43.850 --> 05:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:46.250 --> 05:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna go ahead right now with

05:55:51.770 --> 05:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
here HP 517
 
05:55:54.048 --> 05:55:54.058 align:start position:0%
so if everybody would turn their books
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
to 517 and we have representative Miler
 
05:56:06.770 --> 05:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Miler well thank
 
05:56:11.208 --> 05:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
you Mr uh Mr chairman my name is Mel
 
05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
Miler uh representing Hopkinton and Beau
 
05:56:19.010 --> 05:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce uh 517 relative to
 
05:56:21.948 --> 05:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
background check for surrogate parents
 
05:56:24.590 --> 05:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to introduce this on the
 
05:56:27.288 --> 05:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
part of the department since there is a
 
05:56:31.090 --> 05:56:31.100 align:start position:0%
need I passed out to you two uh handouts
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
that basically Define what a surrogate
 
05:56:36.890 --> 05:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
parent is and it was interesting because
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
when Deanna asked me to do this in all
 
05:56:43.368 --> 05:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
Canada I had no clue what a surrogate
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
parent was but as you can see as you
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
begin to look at this at the surrogate
 
05:56:50.930 --> 05:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
parent plays a very important role in
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
the area of special education
 
05:56:56.930 --> 05:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
and uh and disabilities as you can
 
05:56:59.390 --> 05:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
Define as it's defined in the handouts
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
it basically under idea it provides an
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an individual to
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
basically be trained and certified in
 
05:57:11.868 --> 05:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
becoming the surrogate parent for a an
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
individual who is disabled and either
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
the parent is in it has an inability to
 
05:57:19.250 --> 05:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
represent the needs of that that
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual or in fact they don't know
 
05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
where the parent is and so this is a
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
serious thing and um but I would like if
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't mind I would defer
 
05:57:32.448 --> 05:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
questions to me because the department
 
05:57:34.610 --> 05:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
is going to be here to basically answer
 
05:57:36.530 --> 05:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the need for this
 
05:57:39.170 --> 05:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
particular uh background check for these
 
05:57:41.090 --> 05:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
surrogate parents but if you have a
 
05:57:42.890 --> 05:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
question I might be able to answer and
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay I I think we're gonna just try to
 
05:57:49.070 --> 05:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
get right to the department
 
05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%

05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:27.958 --> 05:58:30.730 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:58:30.730 --> 05:58:30.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.208 --> 05:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
you're a typical prosecutor yeah and you
 
05:58:36.770 --> 05:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
still all heard me so there's a problem
 
05:58:38.990 --> 05:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
right there good afternoon my name is
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenn I'm an attorney for the
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh with me is
 
05:58:45.770 --> 05:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
Becky for debt with special ed so uh
 
05:58:47.628 --> 05:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative Miler for
 
05:58:49.610 --> 05:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
bringing forward House Bill 517 on
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department
 
05:58:55.610 --> 05:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
um so the educational surrogate program
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
has been in effect for a while and Becky
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
will answer all questions as it pertains
 
05:59:01.610 --> 05:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
to that program
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
um my cursory understanding of it is
 
05:59:08.570 --> 05:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
when a child is placed in dcyf care
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
um there are times where that individual
 
05:59:12.650 --> 05:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
may or may not be able to serve making
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
educational decisions for that child and
 
05:59:17.448 --> 05:59:17.458 align:start position:0%
so an educational surrogate is a
 
05:59:19.128 --> 05:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
specialized person who can make those
 
05:59:22.368 --> 05:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
decisions on behalf of the child they
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of Education
 
05:59:25.850 --> 05:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
and they work hand in glove with the
 
05:59:28.490 --> 05:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
child and so the department does as one
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
would expect and hope run criminal
 
05:59:33.530 --> 05:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
background checks on those individuals
 
05:59:35.628 --> 05:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
prior to them becoming educational
 
05:59:35.638 --> 05:59:37.690 align:start position:0%
prior to them becoming educational
surrogates

05:59:37.690 --> 05:59:37.700 align:start position:0%
surrogates
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
the permission for running the
 
05:59:42.770 --> 05:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
background checks was in our
 
05:59:45.890 --> 05:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules it was not and is
 
05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
not in the statute it was in our
 
05:59:50.930 --> 05:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
05:59:52.670 --> 05:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and it was brought to our attention
 
05:59:55.368 --> 05:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
by the department of safety who always
 
05:59:58.128 --> 05:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
tends to show up whenever I testify
 
06:00:00.850 --> 06:00:00.860 align:start position:0%
um that that practice
 
06:00:04.850 --> 06:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
was no longer allowed under the FBI
 
06:00:06.530 --> 06:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
regulations which this committee has
 
06:00:09.530 --> 06:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
heard reference to in various forms
 
06:00:13.730 --> 06:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
um that the authority to disseminate the
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
background check had to be in statute
 
06:00:20.650 --> 06:00:20.660 align:start position:0%
it could not just simply appear in rules
 
06:00:24.890 --> 06:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
along those lines we recognize that the
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
rules that authorize the background
 
06:00:29.868 --> 06:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
checks was not entirely clear as to what
 
06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
the department was looking for what some
 
06:00:34.850 --> 06:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
of the disqualifying offenses would be
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so this was a great opportunity for
 
06:00:40.368 --> 06:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
the Department to clarify what that
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
background check would look for
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we just linked it to 189 13A that's
 
06:00:49.250 --> 06:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
already set out in statute for
 
06:00:50.448 --> 06:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
employment this committee is very
 
06:00:52.730 --> 06:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
familiar with that terminology and that
 
06:00:55.250 --> 06:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
list of disqualifiers that we have
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
talked about previously so that
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything is consistent so we're happy
 
06:01:02.448 --> 06:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and I believe that
 
06:01:03.890 --> 06:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
department of safety is still here to
 
06:01:06.048 --> 06:01:06.058 align:start position:0%
answer questions as it pertains to their
 
06:01:06.058 --> 06:01:08.330 align:start position:0%
answer questions as it pertains to their
process

06:01:08.330 --> 06:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
06:01:10.680 --> 06:01:11.930 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
Tanner

06:01:11.930 --> 06:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
06:01:13.490 --> 06:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:15.110 --> 06:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
um how many surrogate parents are
 
06:01:15.120 --> 06:01:16.368 align:start position:0%
um how many surrogate parents are
currently

06:01:16.368 --> 06:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:01:19.850 --> 06:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
around so currently we have um two
 
06:01:21.530 --> 06:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
different types of educational surrogate
 
06:01:23.448 --> 06:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
parents we have Master educational
 
06:01:25.610 --> 06:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
surrogates we currently have six and
 
06:01:27.410 --> 06:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
they are paid by the department
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and trained by the department they're
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
typically people who have been a special
 
06:01:32.810 --> 06:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
education administrator they have a lot
 
06:01:34.490 --> 06:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
of experience in special education and
 
06:01:35.750 --> 06:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
they take some of our more difficult
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
cases and then we have
 
06:01:40.670 --> 06:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
on the books over a hundred educational
 
06:01:43.730 --> 06:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
surrogates that are volunteers that take
 
06:01:45.890 --> 06:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
on just some kids that have had an issue
 
06:01:49.250 --> 06:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
and are involved with dcyf or students
 
06:01:50.930 --> 06:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
that um their parents can't be found
 
06:01:52.490 --> 06:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
they may be living with a grandparent or
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else and so we assign an
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.868 --> 06:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
further questions repson woodcock
 
06:02:04.610 --> 06:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for coming
 
06:02:04.620 --> 06:02:06.250 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for coming
um

06:02:06.250 --> 06:02:06.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:08.930 --> 06:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
the information you gave us uh the
 
06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
handout that over the mileage came
 
06:02:13.368 --> 06:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
forward uh on surrogate parents for
 
06:02:16.128 --> 06:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
references all the stuff in Minnesota so
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
just my question is does New Hampshire
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
have a training program similar to a
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
different thing or at all for surrogate
 
06:02:23.570 --> 06:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
parents sure I'm not familiar with the
 
06:02:25.010 --> 06:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
handout that you have but I can speak to
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
it um we do have a training for all of
 
06:02:29.390 --> 06:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
our educational surrogates they attend a
 
06:02:31.490 --> 06:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
training with us for about it takes like
 
06:02:33.770 --> 06:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
at least a day and a half it's been a
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
little shorter now that it's been
 
06:02:37.010 --> 06:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
virtual but um and then they have to
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
take a test that goes through just some
 
06:02:40.368 --> 06:02:40.378 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire rules around
 
06:02:42.288 --> 06:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
special education and some of what their
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and things like
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
that so there is a whole um training
 
06:02:47.930 --> 06:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
that we've developed for those thank you
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
06:02:52.010 --> 06:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
questions representative Damon thank you
 
06:02:53.208 --> 06:02:53.218 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:02:53.218 --> 06:02:54.230 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

06:02:54.230 --> 06:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
do the Serbian parents have any
 
06:02:58.080 --> 06:02:59.090 align:start position:0%
do the Serbian parents have any
um

06:02:59.090 --> 06:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:00.830 --> 06:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
communication directly with the children
 
06:03:03.708 --> 06:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
do they are they like Casa Volunteers in
 
06:03:07.190 --> 06:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
any way or develop like how do they
 
06:03:09.170 --> 06:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
become able to represent for these kids
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
I guess is what I'm trying to ask so
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're assigned so uh um the process is
 
06:03:14.930 --> 06:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
that a district would reach out to us
 
06:03:17.090 --> 06:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
and fill out an application to have an
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
educational surrogate assigned either
 
06:03:20.990 --> 06:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
because of dcyf or because they have not
 
06:03:22.970 --> 06:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
been able to find the parent and they
 
06:03:24.590 --> 06:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
may be living with a relative or a
 
06:03:27.110 --> 06:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
neighbor or somebody else and then we
 
06:03:29.448 --> 06:03:29.458 align:start position:0%
ensure that we go we have a person who
 
06:03:31.850 --> 06:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
is solely that's her one of her jobs she
 
06:03:33.708 --> 06:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
goes through the application she goes
 
06:03:34.850 --> 06:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
through who we have for educational
 
06:03:37.250 --> 06:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
surrogates and assigns a surrogate
 
06:03:38.510 --> 06:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
um depending on the age of the child
 
06:03:40.610 --> 06:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
they do meet with the child they do like
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
if it's an older student they will talk
 
06:03:43.730 --> 06:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
to them about their plan talk to them
 
06:03:45.890 --> 06:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
about what might go into the plan just
 
06:03:47.690 --> 06:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
like a parent would you know they want
 
06:03:49.010 --> 06:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
you to work on this or they want you to
 
06:03:51.288 --> 06:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
work on that but they do become involved
 
06:03:52.670 --> 06:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
with the child as well so that they're
 
06:03:54.410 --> 06:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
representing the child's best interests
 
06:03:56.868 --> 06:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
and they know about the child
 
06:03:56.878 --> 06:03:58.128 align:start position:0%
and they know about the child
oh

06:03:58.128 --> 06:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:03:58.138 --> 06:03:59.530 align:start position:0%
oh
exactly

06:03:59.530 --> 06:03:59.540 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
are if the child's with extended family
 
06:04:04.128 --> 06:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
members you mentioned grandparents are
 
06:04:06.830 --> 06:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
they sometimes in this role
 
06:04:06.840 --> 06:04:07.548 align:start position:0%
they sometimes in this role
um

06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
typically they would have gotten
 
06:04:10.850 --> 06:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
guardianship so this is where maybe the
 
06:04:12.288 --> 06:04:12.298 align:start position:0%
grandparent doesn't want to do that they
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a temporary situation or um
 
06:04:19.128 --> 06:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.170 --> 06:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
no further questions
 
06:04:23.330 --> 06:04:23.340 align:start position:0%

so um you you can go ahead and move in
 
06:04:49.250 --> 06:04:49.260 align:start position:0%

this is one where after I have
um

06:07:47.690 --> 06:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the primary uh sponsor presented most
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
likely due to the number of cards which
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have I'm going to go down to the
 
06:08:07.208 --> 06:08:07.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:27.170 --> 06:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:32.990 --> 06:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:36.650 --> 06:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
well welcome I was looking for your yes
 
06:08:38.030 --> 06:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's in this bundle somewhere
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
it is Mr chairman okay thank you welcome
 
06:08:42.650 --> 06:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh this is the prime sponsor of the bill
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
pie 39. thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee for the
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jim Cole I'm a state
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative representing Hillsborough
 
06:08:53.930 --> 06:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
County District 32 which comprises the
 
06:08:58.190 --> 06:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
towns of Wilton Temple and New Ipswich
 
06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 539 uh very simply would
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
prohibit K-12 public schools in the
 
06:09:04.730 --> 06:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
06:09:07.128 --> 06:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
from hosting vaccination clinics during
 
06:09:08.868 --> 06:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
school hours
 
06:09:10.430 --> 06:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
it would stipulate that if schools are
 
06:09:15.288 --> 06:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
to host vaccination clinics outside of
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
school hours that that a parent would
 
06:09:21.470 --> 06:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
would need to be present with their with
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
their children at the time that a
 
06:09:24.650 --> 06:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
vaccine is administered
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
06:09:29.448 --> 06:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
several very important reasons why I
 
06:09:31.010 --> 06:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward first of all
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental conflict between
 
06:09:36.288 --> 06:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
the practices in these clinics and the
 
06:09:39.250 --> 06:09:39.260 align:start position:0%
principle of informed consent
 
06:09:41.990 --> 06:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
mind you I'm not saying that there is a
 
06:09:44.750 --> 06:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
conflict between the stated policies and
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
procedures I am talking about the actual
 
06:09:50.930 --> 06:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
practices at these clinics conflicting
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.000 --> 06:10:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
secondly

06:10:00.650 --> 06:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:02.090 --> 06:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
hosting these vaccination clinics
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
detracts from the core mission of our
 
06:10:05.330 --> 06:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
schools I have spoken to numerous
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
parents who say that this erodes trust
 
06:10:10.128 --> 06:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
they are concerned that if they send
 
06:10:12.708 --> 06:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
their child to school on a day that a
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinic is being held they do
 
06:10:17.330 --> 06:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
not know whether their child will be
 
06:10:19.548 --> 06:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against their wishes and I
 
06:10:21.470 --> 06:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
have several stories that I would like
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
to relate to you about instances where
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
that exact scenario played out
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh third and perhaps most importantly
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are serious safety concerns
 
06:10:36.010 --> 06:10:36.020 align:start position:0%
associated with this there are medical
 
06:10:38.208 --> 06:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
contraindications to certain
 
06:10:41.208 --> 06:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so the flu vaccine for
 
06:10:44.090 --> 06:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
example can cause serious adverse
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
reactions potentially life-threatening
 
06:10:46.200 --> 06:10:48.128 align:start position:0%
reactions potentially life-threatening
reactions

06:10:48.128 --> 06:10:48.138 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
06:10:52.730 --> 06:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
if if a child has certain allergies
 
06:10:54.948 --> 06:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
um or or other conditions so I'll get
 
06:10:57.770 --> 06:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
into that in a little bit more detail
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to start out by by relating
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
a story that that happened in
 
06:11:04.910 --> 06:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro Vermont in uh late 2021 I
 
06:11:07.970 --> 06:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
believe it's November of 2021.
 
06:11:07.980 --> 06:11:09.470 align:start position:0%
believe it's November of 2021.
um

06:11:09.470 --> 06:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:13.310 --> 06:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
a young boy six-year-old boy uh was was
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
attending an elementary school public
 
06:11:17.208 --> 06:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
elementary school in Brattleboro where
 
06:11:19.368 --> 06:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
they were scheduled to host a covid
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic
 
06:11:23.090 --> 06:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
the principal of the school approached
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
the the parents said we'd love to have
 
06:11:29.810 --> 06:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
you give us a consent form have your son
 
06:11:29.820 --> 06:11:31.010 align:start position:0%
you give us a consent form have your son
vaccinated

06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
06:11:33.288 --> 06:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
the parents specifically declined that
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
request and said no we don't want our
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
son vaccinated now in Vermont there's
 
06:11:39.470 --> 06:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
actually a an incentive system a
 
06:11:40.970 --> 06:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
financial incentive system for the
 
06:11:43.788 --> 06:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
schools to uh to achieve a certain
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of a vaccination among
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
student body
 
06:11:51.890 --> 06:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
so in this case uh the young man and
 
06:11:55.610 --> 06:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
I'll use his his initials as uh as as is
 
06:11:58.850 --> 06:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
done in the in the court complaint
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
his initials were LP
 
06:12:04.368 --> 06:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
and uh he came home from school that day
 
06:12:07.010 --> 06:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
and had a name tag on that had his first
 
06:12:07.020 --> 06:12:08.330 align:start position:0%
and had a name tag on that had his first
name

06:12:08.330 --> 06:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
name
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
and someone else's last name
 
06:12:13.970 --> 06:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
and he said Mommy I got a shot today
 
06:12:17.390 --> 06:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
and she uh she thought he was playing
 
06:12:18.830 --> 06:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
around a little bit he said no really I
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
got a shot later she discovered that he
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
had a vaccine card in his backpack
 
06:12:27.230 --> 06:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
it had his first name and someone else's
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
last name
 
06:12:30.470 --> 06:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
he had a bandage on his arm
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and soreness in his arm and yes in fact
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
he had been
 
06:12:40.250 --> 06:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
the school did Apologize
 
06:12:45.410 --> 06:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
the mother and father eventually filed
 
06:12:45.420 --> 06:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
the mother and father eventually filed
suit

06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
suit
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
one of those parents is in the room with
 
06:12:51.830 --> 06:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
us today he's not going to be testifying
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
his attorney has advised him that
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
because there may be additional pending
 
06:12:58.250 --> 06:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
litigation he should not testify
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless just in December a superior
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
court judge in the state of Vermont
 
06:13:05.090 --> 06:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
dismissed that suit said the federal
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
prep act because this was the covid
 
06:13:09.288 --> 06:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
vaccine the federal prep Act and the
 
06:13:11.390 --> 06:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
prep act declaration that applies to the
 
06:13:14.330 --> 06:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
essentially says that nobody is
 
06:13:16.680 --> 06:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
essentially says that nobody is
responsible

06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
06:13:18.000 --> 06:13:19.610 align:start position:0%
responsible
nobody

06:13:19.610 --> 06:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
06:13:19.620 --> 06:13:24.410 align:start position:0%
nobody
zero

06:13:24.410 --> 06:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.430 --> 06:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:32.330 --> 06:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
informed consent dictates that two
 
06:13:32.340 --> 06:13:33.170 align:start position:0%
informed consent dictates that two
things

06:13:33.170 --> 06:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
be present information and consent
 
06:13:39.048 --> 06:13:39.058 align:start position:0%
so information means you are aware of
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
the procedure being proposed you're
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
aware of the Alternatives you're aware
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the consequences of getting treatment
 
06:13:47.150 --> 06:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
or not getting treatment
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:54.048 --> 06:13:54.058 align:start position:0%
it also requires consent that is it
 
06:13:55.730 --> 06:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be voluntary
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
and as a general rule when it comes to
 
06:14:01.010 --> 06:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
minors informed consent rest with the
 
06:14:01.020 --> 06:14:04.190 align:start position:0%
minors informed consent rest with the
parents

06:14:04.190 --> 06:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has published
 
06:14:07.730 --> 06:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
a document entitled guidance and
 
06:14:10.128 --> 06:14:10.138 align:start position:0%
standing orders for influenza
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and there's a section in
 
06:14:16.570 --> 06:14:16.580 align:start position:0%
there on procedures to be taken with
 
06:14:19.190 --> 06:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 18 being
 
06:14:19.200 --> 06:14:20.270 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 18 being
vaccinated

06:14:20.270 --> 06:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
06:14:22.690 --> 06:14:22.700 align:start position:0%
in two separate places in that document
 
06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
it emphasizes the importance of
 
06:14:27.530 --> 06:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
attaining consent
 
06:14:29.288 --> 06:14:29.298 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to quote from that document
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
consent must be completed correctly
 
06:14:36.650 --> 06:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
if the consent form is not completed in
 
06:14:39.890 --> 06:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
its entirety I.E missing an answer to a
 
06:14:42.590 --> 06:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
question signed dated by a parent
 
06:14:42.600 --> 06:14:43.730 align:start position:0%
question signed dated by a parent
Guardian

06:14:43.730 --> 06:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
Guardian
 
06:14:48.910 --> 06:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
in September of 2022
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
the national Department of Public Health
 
06:14:56.750 --> 06:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
conducted a vaccination clinic at the
 
06:14:59.930 --> 06:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
Birch Hill Elementary School in Nashua
 
06:15:02.208 --> 06:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
at that clinic they administered the flu
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:08.570 --> 06:15:08.580 align:start position:0%

06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
form there is no signed consent form
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
now the the mother in that case was here
 
06:15:16.368 --> 06:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she had a time limit she
 
06:15:17.810 --> 06:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
had to leave at three o'clock so she's
 
06:15:20.330 --> 06:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to testify but I do
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
have written testimony from her and if
 
06:15:24.048 --> 06:15:24.058 align:start position:0%
it has not already not already been sent
 
06:15:25.788 --> 06:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
we will make sure that the committee
 
06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
gets her testimony
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
several weeks after that incident
 
06:15:32.690 --> 06:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I was sitting on a statutory
 
06:15:34.850 --> 06:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee which was the committee to
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
study the listing of childhood
 
06:15:38.690 --> 06:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
immunizations for children
 
06:15:40.970 --> 06:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
um at one of those hearings State
 
06:15:44.448 --> 06:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Benjamin Chan responded
 
06:15:46.610 --> 06:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
to some questions about this incident in
 
06:15:48.830 --> 06:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
Nashua and during that testimony he
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
referred to this as a never event
 
06:15:54.110 --> 06:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know what is a never event that is a
 
06:15:56.090 --> 06:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
medical expression it means something
 
06:16:00.010 --> 06:16:00.020 align:start position:0%
that you'd never ever ever happen
 
06:16:02.570 --> 06:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
operating on the wrong patient is a
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
never event
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
amputating the wrong limb is an Ever
 
06:16:05.878 --> 06:16:06.770 align:start position:0%
amputating the wrong limb is an Ever
event

06:16:06.770 --> 06:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
event
 
06:16:08.930 --> 06:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
leaving a surgical sponge inside a
 
06:16:11.090 --> 06:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
patient is a never event
 
06:16:12.770 --> 06:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
this is an event that should never have
 
06:16:12.780 --> 06:16:13.970 align:start position:0%
this is an event that should never have
happened

06:16:13.970 --> 06:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:16:16.850 --> 06:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
at that time the committee was assured
 
06:16:19.128 --> 06:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
that the state is taking steps to ensure
 
06:16:24.288 --> 06:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:28.190 --> 06:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
several weeks later it happened again
 
06:16:30.288 --> 06:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
06:16:30.298 --> 06:16:31.730 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
okay

06:16:31.730 --> 06:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:37.670 --> 06:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
the mother submitted a consent form
 
06:16:39.530 --> 06:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
I've provided members of the committee
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
with a redacted copy of that consent
 
06:16:45.170 --> 06:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
form so if you look at the handout that
 
06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
I gave you you'll see what that looks
 
06:16:46.620 --> 06:16:48.910 align:start position:0%
I gave you you'll see what that looks
like

06:16:48.910 --> 06:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay I guess they're they're still going
 
06:16:51.840 --> 06:16:53.090 align:start position:0%
okay I guess they're they're still going
around

06:16:53.090 --> 06:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:16:55.788 --> 06:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to provide
 
06:16:59.570 --> 06:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
emailed copies as well
 
06:17:01.730 --> 06:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
on that consent form
 
06:17:03.530 --> 06:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
I would argue that that consent form
 
06:17:05.750 --> 06:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
does not comply with the uh
 
06:17:07.730 --> 06:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
the requirements that I just read to you
 
06:17:10.010 --> 06:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago it's not completed it
 
06:17:12.708 --> 06:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
is not signed it does however at the
 
06:17:14.930 --> 06:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
bottom of the of the first page say
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
State and I'll use the the person's
 
06:17:17.040 --> 06:17:18.110 align:start position:0%
State and I'll use the the person's
initial

06:17:18.110 --> 06:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
initial
 
06:17:22.670 --> 06:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
B will not be getting this shot please I
 
06:17:25.128 --> 06:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
do not consent
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
the second page
 
06:17:29.030 --> 06:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of signature lines
 
06:17:30.910 --> 06:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
there is no signature there is no date
 
06:17:34.128 --> 06:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
and but there is the word no written in
 
06:17:35.448 --> 06:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
large capital letters with an
 
06:17:38.330 --> 06:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
exclamation point and an underline
 
06:17:40.970 --> 06:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
I would ask you if we have written
 
06:17:43.250 --> 06:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines that say consent is
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
critically important and we should deny
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
vaccination if we don't have a signed
 
06:17:50.330 --> 06:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
consent form how in the world
 
06:17:53.208 --> 06:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
does something get like this get by the
 
06:17:53.218 --> 06:18:01.850 align:start position:0%
does something get like this get by the
screeners

06:18:01.850 --> 06:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
the lesson here is that
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
we do not have systems in place we do
 
06:18:10.190 --> 06:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
not have adequate controls in place to
 
06:18:11.690 --> 06:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we're not going to have
 
06:18:14.750 --> 06:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
other incidents like this there are you
 
06:18:16.128 --> 06:18:16.138 align:start position:0%
know whether you whether you believe
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
that vaccine vaccines are are critically
 
06:18:21.010 --> 06:18:21.020 align:start position:0%
important to Public Health or not
 
06:18:25.070 --> 06:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
parental rights come into play informed
 
06:18:27.650 --> 06:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
consent comes into play and there's very
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
one very important reason why
 
06:18:33.048 --> 06:18:33.058 align:start position:0%
parents might say they do not want to
 
06:18:34.310 --> 06:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
give consent for their child to be
 
06:18:37.730 --> 06:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
vaccinated namely that there are
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
safety and health concerns associated
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
severe allergic reactions can occur
 
06:18:44.638 --> 06:18:45.970 align:start position:0%
severe allergic reactions can occur
and

06:18:45.970 --> 06:18:45.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:48.288 --> 06:18:48.298 align:start position:0%
according to this I'm going to say the
 
06:18:50.990 --> 06:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
CDC website has a list of things it says
 
06:18:53.868 --> 06:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
it lists people who can't get the flu
 
06:18:57.048 --> 06:18:57.058 align:start position:0%
shot not shouldn't not are advised
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
against can't get the flu shot
 
06:19:02.030 --> 06:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
that includes individuals with severe
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
life-threatening allergies to flu
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine or any ingredients in the
 
06:19:05.280 --> 06:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
vaccine or any ingredients in the
vaccine

06:19:06.350 --> 06:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
06:19:09.170 --> 06:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
or specific metal medical conditions
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
such as Guillain-Barre syndrome any
 
06:19:14.750 --> 06:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
devices against people getting the
 
06:19:16.250 --> 06:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
vaccine if they're simply not feeling
 
06:19:16.260 --> 06:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
vaccine if they're simply not feeling
well

06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:19:19.490 --> 06:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
parents know what is best for their
 
06:19:22.190 --> 06:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
children they have the legal right and
 
06:19:25.010 --> 06:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
the moral rate to give consent or
 
06:19:27.048 --> 06:19:27.058 align:start position:0%
withhold consent
 
06:19:30.010 --> 06:19:30.020 align:start position:0%
as I noted earlier these vaccines
 
06:19:32.628 --> 06:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
undermine trust in our Public Schools
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
they undermine the mission of our Public
 
06:19:34.138 --> 06:19:35.690 align:start position:0%
they undermine the mission of our Public
Schools

06:19:35.690 --> 06:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
06:19:35.700 --> 06:19:37.128 align:start position:0%
Schools
and

06:19:37.128 --> 06:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
I have personally spoken with parents
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
who say they do not want their child
 
06:19:43.250 --> 06:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
going to the school if there is a
 
06:19:45.470 --> 06:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinic being held in the
 
06:19:47.330 --> 06:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
case of the family in Brattleboro they
 
06:19:49.010 --> 06:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
pulled their child out of public school
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
permanently and put them in a private
 
06:19:56.690 --> 06:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:58.010 --> 06:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
I believe that the organizations
 
06:20:00.350 --> 06:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
conducting these clinics have good
 
06:20:03.410 --> 06:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
intentions but we have seen
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
proof at this point that they cannot
 
06:20:08.208 --> 06:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they will not be
 
06:20:09.890 --> 06:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
following the procedures that they are
 
06:20:11.510 --> 06:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
06:20:14.090 --> 06:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
supposed to be following for this reason
 
06:20:17.510 --> 06:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you protect trust in
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools correct protect the
 
06:20:21.948 --> 06:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
rights of parents to determine what's
 
06:20:24.048 --> 06:20:24.058 align:start position:0%
best for their children and protect the
 
06:20:25.070 --> 06:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the children
 
06:20:28.190 --> 06:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
themselves by voting ought to pass on
 
06:20:30.770 --> 06:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 539 and with that Mr chairman
 
06:20:33.770 --> 06:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:20:38.150 --> 06:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
06:20:38.160 --> 06:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
um

06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:49.030 --> 06:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
um just wondering this um second
 
06:20:52.368 --> 06:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
incident where we have the form copy of
 
06:20:54.410 --> 06:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
the form uh where was what school was
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that located in
 
06:20:57.530 --> 06:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall the specific school
 
06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
that was in Rochester New Hampshire
 
06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Rochester okay for follow-up yes and
 
06:21:06.590 --> 06:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
this vaccine clinic was for a flu
 
06:21:06.600 --> 06:21:07.690 align:start position:0%
this vaccine clinic was for a flu
vaccine

06:21:07.690 --> 06:21:07.700 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
06:21:09.708 --> 06:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
correct the two incidents that we're
 
06:21:11.690 --> 06:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
aware of that and again I say that we're
 
06:21:13.788 --> 06:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
aware of because I I strongly suspect
 
06:21:15.470 --> 06:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
there are others you know that don't get
 
06:21:17.448 --> 06:21:17.458 align:start position:0%
reported but the two that we're aware of
 
06:21:19.368 --> 06:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire both involve the
 
06:21:24.128 --> 06:21:24.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:26.690 --> 06:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:21:29.628 --> 06:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
being here presenting this so if I if
 
06:21:33.350 --> 06:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm correct you're not anti-vaccine
 
06:21:35.810 --> 06:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
your basic concern is just the parental
 
06:21:39.470 --> 06:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
consent the uh the on the uninformed
 
06:21:41.330 --> 06:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
consent is what your concern is it has
 
06:21:43.970 --> 06:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with vaccines
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
Etc is that correct my exactly my
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
concern in bringing this bill forward
 
06:21:50.030 --> 06:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
has everything to do with informed
 
06:21:52.910 --> 06:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
consent parents rights and safety the
 
06:21:54.650 --> 06:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
safety of the children
 
06:21:56.030 --> 06:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
um that's that's why I brought this
 
06:21:59.690 --> 06:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
forward absolutely absolutely please if
 
06:22:00.830 --> 06:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
06:22:03.650 --> 06:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm not this is a topic I don't know
 
06:22:05.270 --> 06:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
much about so I'm
 
06:22:07.930 --> 06:22:07.940 align:start position:0%
glad you're informing this of this yes
 
06:22:11.208 --> 06:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
uh if these vaccines are not available
 
06:22:13.250 --> 06:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
where then would they get the vaccine
 
06:22:19.850 --> 06:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
for polio you know smallpox whatever the
 
06:22:21.948 --> 06:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
ones we need to have for kids to go to
 
06:22:23.448 --> 06:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
school where would those be administered
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
there there are they can get them at the
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
doctor's office they can with many of
 
06:22:29.570 --> 06:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
these including the flu vaccine they can
 
06:22:32.510 --> 06:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
get them at pharmacies
 
06:22:35.150 --> 06:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
um they could get them a school if this
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
bill passes the school could still hold
 
06:22:38.690 --> 06:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
a vaccination clinic it would just be
 
06:22:40.430 --> 06:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
have to have to be held outside of
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
school hours and a parent would need to
 
06:22:45.010 --> 06:22:45.020 align:start position:0%
be present with the child
 
06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
and you know I heard anecdotal
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
information about the Nashua incident
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
incident that there was quite a lot of
 
06:22:55.730 --> 06:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
emotional upset among the children being
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated including the one who was who
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
was vaccinated in error so
 
06:23:03.048 --> 06:23:03.058 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that the the parents
 
06:23:05.570 --> 06:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
being present serves two critical
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
purposes one is that it is absolutely
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
Rock Solid verifiable consent because
 
06:23:13.850 --> 06:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
the parent is right there but it also to
 
06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
provide some some some comfort and
 
06:23:19.368 --> 06:23:19.378 align:start position:0%
affirmation for for a child who's who's
 
06:23:28.390 --> 06:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.270 --> 06:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is no vaccination that's usually
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
explaining how to take care of your feet
 
06:23:36.770 --> 06:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
because this field that your present you
 
06:23:38.990 --> 06:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
have any impact on that part
 
06:23:41.150 --> 06:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
um no Mr chairman it actually doesn't
 
06:23:41.160 --> 06:23:42.770 align:start position:0%
um no Mr chairman it actually doesn't
although

06:23:42.770 --> 06:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
although
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
last biennium I believe is last year
 
06:23:46.970 --> 06:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services heard a bill
 
06:23:50.030 --> 06:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
which stipulated that parents must be
 
06:23:52.010 --> 06:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
notified if there are dental procedures
 
06:23:54.288 --> 06:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools and must give
 
06:23:57.590 --> 06:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
consent and I believe that that and I
 
06:23:59.810 --> 06:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
don't believe I know that that bill
 
06:24:02.208 --> 06:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
um has passed into law so there is a
 
06:24:03.770 --> 06:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
consent requirement for dental
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
procedures already but this but this
 
06:24:08.208 --> 06:24:08.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch on that at all no
 
06:24:12.350 --> 06:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:13.788 --> 06:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:24:15.230 --> 06:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Koval for taking my
 
06:24:17.208 --> 06:24:17.218 align:start position:0%
question this bill has a fiscal note
 
06:24:19.970 --> 06:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
attached to it and on the fiscal note
 
06:24:21.708 --> 06:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
says the Department of Health and Human
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
Services assumes the bill will result in
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the number of vaccination
 
06:24:28.128 --> 06:24:28.138 align:start position:0%
clinics conducted in public schools
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
this may have an indeterminable effect
 
06:24:33.170 --> 06:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
on Department expenditures as direct and
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
indirect costs related to vaccine and
 
06:24:37.610 --> 06:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
Clinic operational costs fluctuate based
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
on demand and access
 
06:24:43.128 --> 06:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
Additionally the department states that
 
06:24:45.650 --> 06:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
school-based clinics satisfy Federal
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
Point of distribution and strategic
 
06:24:50.448 --> 06:24:50.458 align:start position:0%
National stockpile training and exercise
 
06:24:53.208 --> 06:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
requirements a reduction in the number
 
06:24:55.730 --> 06:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
of clinics may require the department to
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
secure alternative training and exercise
 
06:25:00.350 --> 06:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
solutions for the state's Regional
 
06:25:01.910 --> 06:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
public health networks at an
 
06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
indeterminable cost do you have any
 
06:25:06.048 --> 06:25:06.058 align:start position:0%
information regarding that
 
06:25:09.048 --> 06:25:09.058 align:start position:0%
um I I'd say I don't really have
 
06:25:11.330 --> 06:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
information about that I think that
 
06:25:13.070 --> 06:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
there are representatives from the
 
06:25:15.830 --> 06:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
Department here today if they are
 
06:25:17.330 --> 06:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
testifying that I think they could
 
06:25:18.530 --> 06:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
probably provide some of that
 
06:25:20.810 --> 06:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
information and I think there are some
 
06:25:22.610 --> 06:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
people who are probably signed up to
 
06:25:24.170 --> 06:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
testify who have a great deal more
 
06:25:26.330 --> 06:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
expertise in those programs generally
 
06:25:29.810 --> 06:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:29.820 --> 06:25:33.368 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:25:33.368 --> 06:25:33.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:25:36.890 --> 06:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:25:39.230 --> 06:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
so you've indicated that this would
 
06:25:41.150 --> 06:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate vaccination clinics during
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
public school hours but the bill also
 
06:25:46.010 --> 06:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
says more than two hours at the
 
06:25:47.390 --> 06:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
beginning or the end of the school day
 
06:25:47.400 --> 06:25:49.010 align:start position:0%
beginning or the end of the school day
correct

06:25:49.010 --> 06:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:25:52.010 --> 06:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
is the intent that it really not be
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
feasible to do vaccination clinics at
 
06:25:56.570 --> 06:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
schools because that kind of does narrow
 
06:25:57.770 --> 06:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
the window of time when kids would be
 
06:26:00.170 --> 06:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
awake yep thank you for the question not
 
06:26:02.330 --> 06:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
not at all the the intention is that we
 
06:26:05.090 --> 06:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
don't end up with a situation where
 
06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the bell rings at uh 2 30 3
 
06:26:11.090 --> 06:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
o'clock and you know you're shuttled off
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
to the the cafeteria for the for the
 
06:26:16.070 --> 06:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinic the intention is that
 
06:26:18.470 --> 06:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
this this really truly sits outside of
 
06:26:20.390 --> 06:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
school hours I can tell you that I'm the
 
06:26:22.670 --> 06:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair of my local school board we have
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
plenty of events that occur at the
 
06:26:27.530 --> 06:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
school outside of regular school hours
 
06:26:30.590 --> 06:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's sporting events it's
 
06:26:33.530 --> 06:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
science fairs it's club meetings it's
 
06:26:35.750 --> 06:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
PTO it's there's a lot going on in the
 
06:26:38.030 --> 06:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
schools so I don't think this precludes
 
06:26:39.770 --> 06:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
the schools at all from holding
 
06:26:41.810 --> 06:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics if they if they so
 
06:26:41.820 --> 06:26:43.090 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics if they if they so
desire

06:26:43.090 --> 06:26:43.100 align:start position:0%
desire
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
it just eliminates the possibility that
 
06:26:47.330 --> 06:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
we have any of these never events
 
06:26:49.070 --> 06:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
occurring at the schools
 
06:26:51.970 --> 06:26:51.980 align:start position:0%
first question
 
06:26:54.470 --> 06:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good afternoon thank
 
06:26:56.090 --> 06:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh I have two
 
06:26:59.330 --> 06:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
actually uh in in the first part of the
 
06:27:02.510 --> 06:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
the uh bill I don't want but this
 
06:27:07.368 --> 06:27:07.378 align:start position:0%
preclude a school from offering uh a
 
06:27:09.770 --> 06:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinic for staff and faculty
 
06:27:12.830 --> 06:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
before school
 
06:27:14.990 --> 06:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
if they want to host that that's that's
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
an excellent question I.E I thought I
 
06:27:21.470 --> 06:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
think the I I think as I as I read the
 
06:27:23.208 --> 06:27:23.218 align:start position:0%
bill I believe the answer would be Yes
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually and secondly it made a
 
06:27:28.490 --> 06:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
different one probably the same if I may
 
06:27:30.890 --> 06:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative lights okay thank you um
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
the second part is uh
 
06:27:36.410 --> 06:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
if you're if there if the substance of
 
06:27:38.868 --> 06:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure you don't get kids
 
06:27:40.368 --> 06:27:40.378 align:start position:0%
who want to help their parents without
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
consent that's the substance we do know
 
06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that that's it's going to happen uh no
 
06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
matter what program you have
 
06:27:49.610 --> 06:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
um a small number of youngsters or a
 
06:27:51.470 --> 06:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
sorority program is going to be this
 
06:27:54.530 --> 06:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks somehow so that
 
06:27:57.470 --> 06:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
being said if the bill was structurally
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
around item number two
 
06:28:02.090 --> 06:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
that uh let's just let's assume you
 
06:28:03.590 --> 06:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't allow a clinic before or after
 
06:28:06.470 --> 06:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
school for youngsters if the bill was
 
06:28:09.610 --> 06:28:09.620 align:start position:0%
around I am number two and it required
 
06:28:13.548 --> 06:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
parent on-site with the youngster we met
 
06:28:15.948 --> 06:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
do two things solve the issue of your
 
06:28:17.750 --> 06:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
biggest concern to safety and
 
06:28:19.250 --> 06:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
non-consent for parent for youngsters
 
06:28:21.288 --> 06:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
having a vaccination that they shouldn't
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
have been getting uh and V allowing the
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
bulk of the students and parents the
 
06:28:28.310 --> 06:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get that in a pretty
 
06:28:30.590 --> 06:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
orderly manner
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I would
 
06:28:36.110 --> 06:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
all of the parents coming through and
 
06:28:41.208 --> 06:28:41.218 align:start position:0%
being present sort of in the middle of a
 
06:28:42.470 --> 06:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
school day
 
06:28:44.208 --> 06:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
um and one of the issues that I raised
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
here is that this is disruptive to the
 
06:28:48.048 --> 06:28:48.058 align:start position:0%
core mission of schools
 
06:28:51.048 --> 06:28:51.058 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that having parents in
 
06:28:53.868 --> 06:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
and out of the school for a concentrated
 
06:28:56.570 --> 06:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
period of time a very large number of of
 
06:28:59.448 --> 06:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
guests so to speak in the school is is
 
06:29:02.230 --> 06:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
probably in itself A disruption
 
06:29:04.610 --> 06:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
there's really no reason why that
 
06:29:07.850 --> 06:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
couldn't be held you know at you know
 
06:29:09.770 --> 06:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
five to eight o'clock on a weekday
 
06:29:12.110 --> 06:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
evening or all day Saturday there's
 
06:29:13.690 --> 06:29:13.700 align:start position:0%
plenty of times that that could be done
 
06:29:16.190 --> 06:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
that don't disrupt the core educational
 
06:29:18.890 --> 06:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
mission of the of the schools okay thank
 
06:29:21.610 --> 06:29:21.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:23.868 --> 06:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:29:26.208 --> 06:29:26.218 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
06:29:27.708 --> 06:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just take a look at a
 
06:29:30.288 --> 06:29:30.298 align:start position:0%
little language just to make sure that
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is doing all that we actually
 
06:29:34.548 --> 06:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
would want it to do when I think of the
 
06:29:38.570 --> 06:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
word Clinic I think of a a specific
 
06:29:41.750 --> 06:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
event for Mass vaccination
 
06:29:44.930 --> 06:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
and also when I think of
 
06:29:44.940 --> 06:29:47.048 align:start position:0%
and also when I think of
um

06:29:47.048 --> 06:29:47.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:50.208 --> 06:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
uh of having parents there in order to
 
06:29:52.910 --> 06:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
be physically present during vaccination
 
06:29:55.490 --> 06:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
outside of these school hours I'm
 
06:29:58.730 --> 06:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
wondering is there a window possibly in
 
06:30:00.288 --> 06:30:00.298 align:start position:0%
here that may or may not have been
 
06:30:02.390 --> 06:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
intended that would allow students to be
 
06:30:04.128 --> 06:30:04.138 align:start position:0%
vaccinated during the school day on
 
06:30:06.890 --> 06:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
school grounds outside of the context of
 
06:30:08.590 --> 06:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
a clinic
 
06:30:10.970 --> 06:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that is
 
06:30:13.548 --> 06:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the bill is that
 
06:30:13.558 --> 06:30:15.530 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the bill is that
having

06:30:15.530 --> 06:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
having
 
06:30:17.330 --> 06:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
people who are authorized to administer
 
06:30:20.830 --> 06:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the school in the school
 
06:30:24.470 --> 06:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
administering vaccines is a clinic
 
06:30:26.690 --> 06:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
um if the question is you know could the
 
06:30:29.810 --> 06:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
school nurse be authorized to do that
 
06:30:29.820 --> 06:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
school nurse be authorized to do that
um

06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:32.990 --> 06:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm not aware of that being the case
 
06:30:33.000 --> 06:30:34.270 align:start position:0%
I I'm not aware of that being the case
anywhere

06:30:34.270 --> 06:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
06:30:36.590 --> 06:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
my intent would be that that would not
 
06:30:39.048 --> 06:30:39.058 align:start position:0%
happen either but the bill was
 
06:30:41.448 --> 06:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
essentially written to to cover the the
 
06:30:43.250 --> 06:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
existing scenario that we're aware of
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is that there are vaccine clinics
 
06:30:48.288 --> 06:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
being held in public schools in New
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
 
06:30:50.160 --> 06:30:53.570 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
foreign

06:30:53.570 --> 06:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:56.030 --> 06:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:30:57.830 --> 06:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative it's just a
 
06:30:59.270 --> 06:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying question I think you might
 
06:31:01.368 --> 06:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
have said it but I'm not sure so my
 
06:31:03.670 --> 06:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
school district our health insurance
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
provides the service to our staff
 
06:31:09.590 --> 06:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
to tab the flu shot if they so choose
 
06:31:11.570 --> 06:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
they have to sign they have to sign
 
06:31:14.448 --> 06:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
their own consent to take it did I hear
 
06:31:17.390 --> 06:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
you say that this bill would prevent
 
06:31:19.128 --> 06:31:19.138 align:start position:0%
that from happening
 
06:31:19.138 --> 06:31:20.150 align:start position:0%
that from happening
um

06:31:20.150 --> 06:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:23.448 --> 06:31:23.458 align:start position:0%
I yeah my response was I think that if I
 
06:31:25.310 --> 06:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
read the bill technically speaking that
 
06:31:28.128 --> 06:31:28.138 align:start position:0%
that it would however
 
06:31:30.830 --> 06:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it might make good sense to
 
06:31:33.410 --> 06:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
have uh on professional days to to
 
06:31:35.868 --> 06:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
allocate some time there or if the
 
06:31:37.548 --> 06:31:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to amend the bill and
 
06:31:39.650 --> 06:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
exclude that scenario or you know
 
06:31:42.410 --> 06:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
specify that this applies to uh to
 
06:31:45.170 --> 06:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
students only then I think that that
 
06:31:47.090 --> 06:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
would still fulfill the the intent of
 
06:31:48.830 --> 06:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as I've introduced it okay
 
06:31:50.690 --> 06:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:31:53.628 --> 06:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
get that question for you um
 
06:31:56.810 --> 06:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
when I took my grandkids down to get
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
their covert shots from the Army
 
06:32:03.470 --> 06:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
I had terrible power of medical attorney
 
06:32:06.350 --> 06:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's needed but that's that's not
 
06:32:06.360 --> 06:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's needed but that's that's not
guardianship

06:32:07.910 --> 06:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
06:32:11.090 --> 06:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
so questioning if the parent is
 
06:32:13.070 --> 06:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
unavailable to do this and it's coming
 
06:32:16.010 --> 06:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
two hours after the school days over
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a grandparent they're able to do
 
06:32:21.788 --> 06:32:21.798 align:start position:0%
that or it's a legal guardian
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're an attorney here
 
06:32:25.788 --> 06:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
and you might be able to help me out
 
06:32:28.730 --> 06:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
with that would it be acceptable if even
 
06:32:31.190 --> 06:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
letter from your daughter who's a parent
 
06:32:34.490 --> 06:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
and say it's okay to or
 
06:32:34.500 --> 06:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
and say it's okay to or
um

06:32:40.310 --> 06:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
so if you're directing the question to
 
06:32:44.270 --> 06:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
me I would say that a a letter
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
um would not be sufficient under the
 
06:32:49.250 --> 06:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
bill as written a power of attorney I
 
06:32:51.170 --> 06:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
would have to defer to an attorney on
 
06:32:52.970 --> 06:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:32:52.980 --> 06:32:54.310 align:start position:0%
that question
um

06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:57.530 --> 06:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know how the courts would
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:10.250 --> 06:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
ask you yes representative
 
06:33:14.090 --> 06:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm just revisiting the
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
topic of
 
06:33:18.350 --> 06:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
outside of the school day but near to
 
06:33:21.288 --> 06:33:21.298 align:start position:0%
the school day that two hour window
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm just reflecting on the busyness
 
06:33:26.510 --> 06:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
of life for working parents young
 
06:33:28.850 --> 06:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
children coming and going back and forth
 
06:33:32.570 --> 06:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear to me why it would be
 
06:33:35.448 --> 06:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
inappropriate with the parent present I
 
06:33:37.670 --> 06:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate and understand that
 
06:33:40.368 --> 06:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
um safety net
 
06:33:42.410 --> 06:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear to me why that could
 
06:33:44.810 --> 06:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
not be occurring after school in a
 
06:33:49.368 --> 06:33:49.378 align:start position:0%
organized appropriate fashion
 
06:33:52.430 --> 06:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's a that's certainly
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
a valid question again my concern about
 
06:33:59.930 --> 06:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
the the the parameters around school
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
hours primarily had to do with
 
06:34:03.360 --> 06:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
hours primarily had to do with
um

06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:08.270 --> 06:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
a scenario in which the the parent is
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
not present so if
 
06:34:13.970 --> 06:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
you know if the committee believes that
 
06:34:16.250 --> 06:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
narrowing that window of time makes
 
06:34:19.850 --> 06:34:19.860 align:start position:0%
sense then you know again it's it's your
 
06:34:23.150 --> 06:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill now so I I would I would I would
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
say that if if you wanted to narrow
 
06:34:27.288 --> 06:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
those parameters and that made it more
 
06:34:28.970 --> 06:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
agreeable to everyone that would be fine
 
06:34:31.070 --> 06:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
you did mention the word convenience and
 
06:34:33.410 --> 06:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
I want to respond to that because
 
06:34:35.090 --> 06:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
um this is something that came up in a
 
06:34:36.948 --> 06:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
discussion I had with a colleague
 
06:34:36.958 --> 06:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
discussion I had with a colleague
um

06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
a few days ago and the the the the the
 
06:34:44.270 --> 06:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
the argument that he made is that this
 
06:34:46.128 --> 06:34:46.138 align:start position:0%
is such a matter of convenience and
 
06:34:49.070 --> 06:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
people are busy and I guess my uh my
 
06:34:51.948 --> 06:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
assertion would be that there are a few
 
06:34:54.110 --> 06:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
if any areas of life where we sacrifice
 
06:34:56.750 --> 06:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
individual rights and
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the Integrity of decisions like
 
06:35:01.010 --> 06:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
06:35:03.650 --> 06:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
um to convenience and
 
06:35:05.810 --> 06:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I would say that uh you know for that
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
reason I feel it's a very important bill
 
06:35:08.690 --> 06:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
06:35:10.930 --> 06:35:10.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:35:14.270 --> 06:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I am going
 
06:35:24.190 --> 06:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:27.530 --> 06:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully two minutes I'm
 
06:35:29.750 --> 06:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
holding 25 cards here you can feel the
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
amount of lab to figure out who's going
 
06:35:33.070 --> 06:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
to get out of here
 
06:35:36.110 --> 06:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
chairman lab yeah so you can hear it now
 
06:35:38.270 --> 06:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
so so we are going to impose that
 
06:35:40.730 --> 06:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule try to keep it down to
 
06:35:40.740 --> 06:35:42.110 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule try to keep it down to
two

06:35:42.110 --> 06:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:35:42.120 --> 06:35:43.208 align:start position:0%
two
um

06:35:43.208 --> 06:35:43.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:45.890 --> 06:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
and for those that are staying for the
 
06:35:49.368 --> 06:35:49.378 align:start position:0%
last two bills due to the time Factor we
 
06:35:51.048 --> 06:35:51.058 align:start position:0%
are not going to be hearing those today
 
06:35:54.650 --> 06:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
we will reset those bills to a time to
 
06:35:56.270 --> 06:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
be announced
 
06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
um we could be here to seven o'clock
 
06:35:58.320 --> 06:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
um we could be here to seven o'clock
tonight

06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
06:35:59.280 --> 06:36:00.590 align:start position:0%
tonight
so

06:36:00.590 --> 06:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:02.930 --> 06:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's anybody's you know
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
wish to do that
 
06:36:07.070 --> 06:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to go forward and
 
06:36:09.170 --> 06:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
we will be starting the timer up here
 
06:36:21.708 --> 06:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:22.970 --> 06:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:36:26.448 --> 06:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
um representative into the committee
 
06:36:29.030 --> 06:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
so my question to everybody is what was
 
06:36:32.270 --> 06:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
school originally made for
 
06:36:36.048 --> 06:36:36.058 align:start position:0%
so this is just an easy Google find and
 
06:36:37.610 --> 06:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
rather than every family being
 
06:36:39.530 --> 06:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
individually responsible for Education
 
06:36:41.868 --> 06:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
people soon figured out that it would be
 
06:36:44.270 --> 06:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
easier and more efficient to have a
 
06:36:46.368 --> 06:36:46.378 align:start position:0%
small group of adults teach a larger
 
06:36:49.070 --> 06:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
group of children in this way the
 
06:36:51.590 --> 06:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
concept of school was born
 
06:36:54.530 --> 06:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
when did Reading Writing in arithmetic
 
06:36:56.690 --> 06:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
become flu clinics
 
06:36:58.970 --> 06:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
eua which is emergency youth
 
06:37:01.610 --> 06:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
authorization injection centers and
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
social emotional Learning Centers
 
06:37:06.410 --> 06:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
the amount of community-based health
 
06:37:09.730 --> 06:37:09.740 align:start position:0%
centers in drug stores Walgreens Walmart
 
06:37:13.070 --> 06:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
that are injecting children for free is
 
06:37:16.368 --> 06:37:16.378 align:start position:0%
unbelievable why are we infusing this
 
06:37:18.410 --> 06:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
into our schools
 
06:37:20.270 --> 06:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
personal story I'm going to age myself
 
06:37:23.270 --> 06:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
here I graduated from high school in
 
06:37:23.280 --> 06:37:25.128 align:start position:0%
here I graduated from high school in
1991.

06:37:25.128 --> 06:37:25.138 align:start position:0%
1991.
 
06:37:27.650 --> 06:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
in no way shape or form in any school
 
06:37:29.448 --> 06:37:29.458 align:start position:0%
that I ever attended
 
06:37:33.288 --> 06:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
there was ever a vaccine clinic nothing
 
06:37:35.868 --> 06:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
the only Clinic that there was in a
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
sense if you want to call it a clinic
 
06:37:39.890 --> 06:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
was the American Red Cross came and they
 
06:37:41.208 --> 06:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
did blood drives
 
06:37:43.730 --> 06:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
and all the high school kids and there's
 
06:37:45.110 --> 06:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone on this committee that I went to
 
06:37:47.570 --> 06:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
high school with so she knows
 
06:37:50.090 --> 06:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
all the kids would go because they
 
06:37:51.470 --> 06:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
didn't give blood because they would get
 
06:37:58.090 --> 06:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:00.590 --> 06:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
I believe that we need to keep school
 
06:38:03.288 --> 06:38:03.298 align:start position:0%
for teaching and learning
 
06:38:05.628 --> 06:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
Reading Writing and arithmetic
 
06:38:07.610 --> 06:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
there are so many issues when it comes
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
to this privacy issues the emails that
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
came from schools in 2021 were
 
06:38:18.288 --> 06:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and I could name three on
 
06:38:21.288 --> 06:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast that sent emails directly
 
06:38:24.288 --> 06:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
to students bypassing parents I'll get
 
06:38:26.530 --> 06:38:26.540 align:start position:0%
you copies of everything
 
06:38:29.750 --> 06:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging them all to get an emergency
 
06:38:33.350 --> 06:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
youth use authorization injection in
 
06:38:36.190 --> 06:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
their arms not going to parents
 
06:38:38.510 --> 06:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging these teens
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
to sign up and get a shot
 
06:38:46.128 --> 06:38:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:48.530 --> 06:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
we have to be focused on teaching
 
06:38:48.540 --> 06:38:49.788 align:start position:0%
we have to be focused on teaching
students

06:38:49.788 --> 06:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:38:51.770 --> 06:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
supporting our teachers
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
because they need that and there's a lot
 
06:38:55.610 --> 06:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
of different mental health issues which
 
06:38:57.890 --> 06:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
you guys talked about earlier
 
06:39:01.070 --> 06:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry but teachers are not
 
06:39:03.230 --> 06:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
doctors and they're not in the health
 
06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
care profession and neither are these
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
06:39:09.650 --> 06:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
the amount of school board meetings that
 
06:39:12.410 --> 06:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
I attended in um
 
06:39:15.350 --> 06:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021
 
06:39:17.330 --> 06:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
and these school boards were literally
 
06:39:17.340 --> 06:39:18.948 align:start position:0%
and these school boards were literally
focused

06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
focused
 
06:39:21.470 --> 06:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
um on about in having students be
 
06:39:24.530 --> 06:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
injected was unbelievable they're not
 
06:39:26.330 --> 06:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals
 
06:39:29.288 --> 06:39:29.298 align:start position:0%
and I um I strongly support this bill
 
06:39:31.670 --> 06:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate
 
06:39:34.910 --> 06:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and appreciate our time
 
06:39:36.590 --> 06:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
06:39:40.490 --> 06:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
06:39:40.500 --> 06:39:42.230 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
testimony

06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:39:53.410 --> 06:39:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:56.208 --> 06:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chairman members
 
06:39:57.890 --> 06:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jason gerhardt
 
06:39:59.510 --> 06:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent Northfield Franklin
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
I'll make this brief
 
06:40:04.190 --> 06:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
my main concern with this would be the
 
06:40:05.990 --> 06:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines
 
06:40:08.990 --> 06:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
I just do not feel and and data suggests
 
06:40:12.170 --> 06:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
that are not safe nor effective
 
06:40:13.970 --> 06:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
and recently I pushed through a
 
06:40:15.830 --> 06:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
resolution at the county level and then
 
06:40:18.110 --> 06:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
also at the state level to have the
 
06:40:19.970 --> 06:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
Attorney General investigate them for
 
06:40:22.490 --> 06:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
fraud and wrongdoing Florida has already
 
06:40:24.288 --> 06:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
initiated a grand jury investigation of
 
06:40:26.628 --> 06:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers so I just don't feel
 
06:40:28.490 --> 06:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
that at this point I'm going to keep on
 
06:40:30.110 --> 06:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
pushing for this I just don't feel at
 
06:40:31.368 --> 06:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
this point we should be exposing the
 
06:40:33.230 --> 06:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
state or the residents of the state to
 
06:40:35.510 --> 06:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the liability and risk involved in these
 
06:40:35.520 --> 06:40:36.650 align:start position:0%
the liability and risk involved in these
experimental

06:40:36.650 --> 06:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call them
 
06:40:41.570 --> 06:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
and I would also say that I think we
 
06:40:43.910 --> 06:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to see the efficacy Data before we
 
06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
push this through taxpayer-funded
 
06:40:45.600 --> 06:40:46.788 align:start position:0%
push this through taxpayer-funded
schools

06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:40:49.610 --> 06:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
if we're so sure about this then let's
 
06:40:50.990 --> 06:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
find out how effective they are before
 
06:40:52.368 --> 06:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
we start pushing it because in a sense
 
06:40:53.330 --> 06:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
if you're pushing it through a school
 
06:40:54.830 --> 06:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're basically co-signing saying that
 
06:40:56.890 --> 06:40:56.900 align:start position:0%
it's safe and it actually does something
 
06:40:59.990 --> 06:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that's my position and I support this
 
06:41:01.970 --> 06:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you representative
 
06:41:01.980 --> 06:41:04.010 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you representative
questions

06:41:04.010 --> 06:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:41:04.020 --> 06:41:06.470 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

06:41:06.470 --> 06:41:06.480 align:start position:0%

Gerhard
 
06:41:09.660 --> 06:41:10.548 align:start position:0%
Gerhard
um

06:41:10.548 --> 06:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:13.010 --> 06:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
does this bill refer to coveted vaccines
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
in particular no it doesn't it covers
 
06:41:16.190 --> 06:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
all of them but that's just my main
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
focus so this is just a bill focusing on
 
06:41:22.368 --> 06:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
vaccines in general yes thank you
 
06:41:24.890 --> 06:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
06:41:26.448 --> 06:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
you very much representative
 
06:41:41.208 --> 06:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:43.128 --> 06:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm representative
 
06:41:45.770 --> 06:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from Stratford district
 
06:41:49.850 --> 06:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
10 which is the town of Durham and I
 
06:41:52.730 --> 06:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
I I oppose this bill I know medical
 
06:41:54.650 --> 06:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
liability regardless of whether we pass
 
06:41:57.890 --> 06:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
this bill or not is a major concern at
 
06:42:01.128 --> 06:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
schools I know school officials are very
 
06:42:03.650 --> 06:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
afraid of being sued they're walking on
 
06:42:03.660 --> 06:42:05.208 align:start position:0%
afraid of being sued they're walking on
eggshells

06:42:05.208 --> 06:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
eggshells
 
06:42:08.628 --> 06:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
but that's uh going to be but that's the
 
06:42:10.368 --> 06:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
case already even with this bill and
 
06:42:12.288 --> 06:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
this is just going to make the situation
 
06:42:14.390 --> 06:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
worse in school school's already like
 
06:42:16.788 --> 06:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
sort of Petri dishes there were all the
 
06:42:18.048 --> 06:42:18.058 align:start position:0%
one of the things that kids do when they
 
06:42:19.250 --> 06:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
go to school they go there to exchange
 
06:42:21.070 --> 06:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
all the uh other
 
06:42:24.170 --> 06:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
viruses and other in their back and
 
06:42:25.430 --> 06:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
their germs and everything with each
 
06:42:27.890 --> 06:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
other and um including
 
06:42:30.430 --> 06:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
including uh including covet
 
06:42:33.708 --> 06:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
and uh I think it's only it's only
 
06:42:36.890 --> 06:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
sensible to uh to vaccinate them and I
 
06:42:38.750 --> 06:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
think having vaccination clinics at the
 
06:42:40.970 --> 06:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
school is very convenient perhaps
 
06:42:42.850 --> 06:42:42.860 align:start position:0%
there may indeed have been some never
 
06:42:46.010 --> 06:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
never events where there's a mix up in
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
the in the forms
 
06:42:49.610 --> 06:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
um certainly
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
certainly it's not uncommon for children
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
to have the same first name as
 
06:42:55.910 --> 06:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
classmates in fact sometimes it seems
 
06:42:57.470 --> 06:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
like about there's only two or three
 
06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
first names in the whole class the
 
06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
classroom but that's not an argument
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
against having vaccination clinics
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's just an argument for keeping
 
06:43:06.788 --> 06:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
better track of which student is which
 
06:43:08.810 --> 06:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
that would be the subject for entire
 
06:43:10.910 --> 06:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
number built a whole different bill
 
06:43:12.948 --> 06:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
and the situation in Vermont by the way
 
06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit those parents have stepped
 
06:43:17.628 --> 06:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
forward they certainly don't have to
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
come and testify at this hearing but
 
06:43:20.330 --> 06:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
their names have been published in the
 
06:43:22.070 --> 06:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
media and their court case currently was
 
06:43:23.150 --> 06:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
dismissed although they're trying to
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
revive it but there's no big secret
 
06:43:29.208 --> 06:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
there but and um it's and I don't think
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh I don't think requiring the
 
06:43:34.730 --> 06:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
parents to come in
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
is is I think that's excessive I think
 
06:43:39.410 --> 06:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
having a verified form and maybe they'd
 
06:43:40.970 --> 06:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
be better job of verifying the form but
 
06:43:43.128 --> 06:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
that's the solution because uh some
 
06:43:45.530 --> 06:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
parents themselves are can perhaps
 
06:43:48.410 --> 06:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
worried about coming to school either uh
 
06:43:49.788 --> 06:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
either because they're afraid they too
 
06:43:51.948 --> 06:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
might get infected by all the uh in fact
 
06:43:54.288 --> 06:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
if there's a uh if there's a epidemic
 
06:43:56.810 --> 06:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
going around which thereof it is
 
06:44:00.110 --> 06:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
and uh or there may be other cases uh
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
they may like for example if a parent is
 
06:44:04.190 --> 06:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
a special enthusiastic gun owner they
 
06:44:06.530 --> 06:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
may be afraid they may be reluctant to
 
06:44:07.970 --> 06:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
come onto the campus Because that's a
 
06:44:09.288 --> 06:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
space where they're not allowed to have
 
06:44:10.850 --> 06:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
their gun
 
06:44:12.708 --> 06:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
and it's only I do recognize school
 
06:44:14.510 --> 06:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
officials are working on eggshells I
 
06:44:16.250 --> 06:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
know they're afraid of being sued but
 
06:44:17.868 --> 06:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the case anyway and I
 
06:44:20.570 --> 06:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
think this uh vaccination clinics uh
 
06:44:22.250 --> 06:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
reduced the risk to everyone in the
 
06:44:23.750 --> 06:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
school community and running the larger
 
06:44:26.448 --> 06:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
community so I think they should uh
 
06:44:28.970 --> 06:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed they should be
 
06:44:31.368 --> 06:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue perhaps you may need
 
06:44:33.530 --> 06:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
and and of course an alternative of it
 
06:44:34.970 --> 06:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
with the bill you're not hearing today
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
we could probably arrange that parents
 
06:44:42.650 --> 06:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh opt into opted to offer off campus
 
06:44:44.690 --> 06:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics but I don't know how
 
06:44:46.368 --> 06:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I shouldn't say but
 
06:44:48.048 --> 06:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
that's probably way outside what the
 
06:44:49.490 --> 06:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee has the time to do with the 99
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is other bills they have
 
06:44:52.788 --> 06:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
so I say
 
06:44:55.010 --> 06:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
please please itl this bill please
 
06:44:56.750 --> 06:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
continue having vaccination clinics
 
06:44:59.390 --> 06:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
especially for especially for covet and
 
06:45:00.470 --> 06:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
we know you have the right not to be
 
06:45:02.090 --> 06:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you also don't have the right
 
06:45:04.788 --> 06:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
to spread a spread a infectious disease
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
especially not a respiratory virus that
 
06:45:08.810 --> 06:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
killed over a million people just here
 
06:45:10.490 --> 06:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the U.S So yeah thank you very much
 
06:45:13.368 --> 06:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:28.610 --> 06:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:30.410 --> 06:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
06:45:31.788 --> 06:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
committee representative poll serving
 
06:45:33.708 --> 06:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
the towns of
 
06:45:35.448 --> 06:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
um Don Barton hooks at Allentown and
 
06:45:36.770 --> 06:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
have some
 
06:45:39.410 --> 06:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
um like to speak on in support of the
 
06:45:41.390 --> 06:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill regarding five different items
 
06:45:43.368 --> 06:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
first of all children cannot give
 
06:45:45.770 --> 06:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
consent that is law in a number of
 
06:45:48.110 --> 06:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
places minors do not have that legal
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
Authority in New Hampshire
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
so it is very difficult to actually meet
 
06:45:55.850 --> 06:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
the medical standards of having informed
 
06:45:57.830 --> 06:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
consent I'll cover informed in a minute
 
06:46:00.410 --> 06:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
when the when the person there is
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
incapable of giving consent
 
06:46:05.330 --> 06:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
um secondly schools are education
 
06:46:06.708 --> 06:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
institutions that's why the bill is
 
06:46:10.070 --> 06:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
before you guys and not necessarily HHS
 
06:46:12.230 --> 06:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
we should be spending our time educating
 
06:46:13.730 --> 06:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
our children instead of trying to turn
 
06:46:15.770 --> 06:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
our schools into medical clinics that
 
06:46:18.770 --> 06:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
are not prepared to do to deal with
 
06:46:21.770 --> 06:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
um there was a filming of an during the
 
06:46:24.170 --> 06:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
rollout of the coveted vaccinations out
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the facility a medical facility a
 
06:46:29.628 --> 06:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
nurse named Tiffany Gover took the
 
06:46:32.690 --> 06:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
vaccination on live TV she was the nurse
 
06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
manager I'd been in the field for a
 
06:46:35.868 --> 06:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
number of years and she collapsed from
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock on live television
 
06:46:42.170 --> 06:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
what happens when a school has a child
 
06:46:44.208 --> 06:46:44.218 align:start position:0%
who hasn't adverse reaction to a
 
06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination goes into anaphylactic shock
 
06:46:47.448 --> 06:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
do you call the parents to say I'm sorry
 
06:46:48.890 --> 06:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
your child
 
06:46:51.350 --> 06:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
um is is on his way to the ER right now
 
06:46:54.590 --> 06:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
because we decided to vaccinate him
 
06:46:56.510 --> 06:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
um let's teach our children in the
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
schools and not try and pretend to be
 
06:47:00.070 --> 06:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
medical clinics
 
06:47:03.048 --> 06:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
next in the state of New Hampshire under
 
06:47:06.048 --> 06:47:06.058 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 currently there are four
 
06:47:09.170 --> 06:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
records of children who have passed away
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
say that again four records of children
 
06:47:13.310 --> 06:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
who have passed away in the last year
 
06:47:17.030 --> 06:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:19.730 --> 06:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
some Mom some Dad out there
 
06:47:23.390 --> 06:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:25.490 --> 06:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
if you look at the data for what
 
06:47:28.250 --> 06:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
happened relative to adverse effects
 
06:47:31.190 --> 06:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
from the covet that the covet virus
 
06:47:33.110 --> 06:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was one loss of life in New
 
06:47:36.230 --> 06:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the age of 29.
 
06:47:38.270 --> 06:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm on division three in finance I'm
 
06:47:40.128 --> 06:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
looking at this data this data doesn't
 
06:47:42.530 --> 06:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
06:47:44.930 --> 06:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly in terms of the
 
06:47:47.628 --> 06:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
online testimonies I would like to read
 
06:47:49.310 --> 06:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
one some people aren't getting their
 
06:47:51.430 --> 06:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
opposition and their support correct
 
06:47:53.990 --> 06:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just pick on one but I noticed this
 
06:47:56.628 --> 06:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
in a couple of places where a person is
 
06:47:58.910 --> 06:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
is testifying
 
06:47:58.920 --> 06:48:00.890 align:start position:0%
is testifying
um

06:48:00.890 --> 06:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:02.930 --> 06:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I quote these clinics would allow us
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
allow for our children to make Health
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
decisions that have potential for
 
06:48:09.890 --> 06:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
various very serious consequences I am
 
06:48:11.570 --> 06:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely opposed to this bill these
 
06:48:13.208 --> 06:48:13.218 align:start position:0%
coping vaccines have caused a multiple
 
06:48:15.110 --> 06:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
multitude of life-changing and
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
life-anging ending injuries so some
 
06:48:20.810 --> 06:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
people are clicking the wrong thing
 
06:48:22.730 --> 06:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
um when the people go through as a
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee and look at the online
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
submissions make sure that you're
 
06:48:26.690 --> 06:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the notes not just
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
opposed support because I think some
 
06:48:29.628 --> 06:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
people inadvertently didn't understand
 
06:48:31.548 --> 06:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
what the bill was trying to do
 
06:48:34.010 --> 06:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close my testimony
 
06:48:37.670 --> 06:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
06:48:40.090 --> 06:48:40.100 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much
 
06:48:43.968 --> 06:48:43.978 align:start position:0%
uh is representative Perez still here
 
06:48:43.978 --> 06:48:45.650 align:start position:0%
uh is representative Perez still here
nope

06:48:45.650 --> 06:48:45.660 align:start position:0%

06:48:45.660 --> 06:48:57.730 align:start position:0%
nope
yes

06:48:57.730 --> 06:48:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:00.410 --> 06:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to speak
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
in front of this community
 
06:49:06.288 --> 06:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
my name is Maria Perez and I represent
 
06:49:08.208 --> 06:49:08.218 align:start position:0%

people who look like me
 
06:49:25.490 --> 06:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm grateful from for having
 
06:49:27.830 --> 06:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
these clinics for my community because a
 
06:49:30.590 --> 06:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
lot of people cannot afford to have
 
06:49:32.810 --> 06:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
or pay or they don't have insurance to
 
06:49:32.820 --> 06:49:34.128 align:start position:0%
or pay or they don't have insurance to
pay

06:49:34.128 --> 06:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
pay
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm grateful that students and kids
 
06:49:39.890 --> 06:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to be vaccinated
 
06:49:43.670 --> 06:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
but not pushing anyone to get vaccinated
 
06:49:45.530 --> 06:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
06:49:48.890 --> 06:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
this mobile clinics come we now
 
06:49:52.788 --> 06:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
utilizing the nurses at school or we're
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
not using the school property to do this
 
06:49:58.190 --> 06:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
they come with a mobile mobile clinic
 
06:50:00.948 --> 06:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
they come with their own own nurses
 
06:50:03.410 --> 06:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're not taking money away from the
 
06:50:05.330 --> 06:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
schools we're not taking money away from
 
06:50:07.250 --> 06:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
the towns on the cities
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're given the people the opportunity
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated we're not pushing
 
06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
people to get vaccinated without parents
 
06:50:15.600 --> 06:50:17.390 align:start position:0%

06:50:27.770 --> 06:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about taking time away
 
06:50:31.548 --> 06:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
from students to get vaccinated
 
06:50:34.190 --> 06:50:34.200 align:start position:0%

06:50:38.628 --> 06:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
about about giving credit to students
 
06:50:41.930 --> 06:50:41.940 align:start position:0%

services
 
06:50:46.190 --> 06:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
why are we saying we're taking away time
 
06:50:48.468 --> 06:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
from the students to get vaccinated
 
06:50:50.448 --> 06:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
this is helping the students to be
 
06:50:52.850 --> 06:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
healthy we should be grateful that their
 
06:50:55.190 --> 06:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
students and people who cannot afford to
 
06:50:57.350 --> 06:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated and be Health they have
 
06:50:59.930 --> 06:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
the opportunity but no
 
06:51:02.990 --> 06:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're going against the help and concern
 
06:51:04.548 --> 06:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
with the community
 
06:51:07.910 --> 06:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
let's stop this
 
06:51:10.310 --> 06:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know what what I wanted to say
 
06:51:13.610 --> 06:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
because I keep hearing antibacterating
 
06:51:16.730 --> 06:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
people and tea vaccine
 
06:51:18.890 --> 06:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
but they keep pushing
 
06:51:18.900 --> 06:51:20.930 align:start position:0%
but they keep pushing
religion

06:51:20.930 --> 06:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
religion
 
06:51:23.750 --> 06:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
they keep pushing
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
empty this until that
 
06:51:28.448 --> 06:51:28.458 align:start position:0%

06:51:43.548 --> 06:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that everything that
 
06:51:46.010 --> 06:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're doing is just pushing the wrong
 
06:51:46.020 --> 06:51:47.690 align:start position:0%
we're doing is just pushing the wrong
way

06:51:47.690 --> 06:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:51:50.570 --> 06:51:50.580 align:start position:0%

my question is a moment you go you said
 
06:52:04.500 --> 06:52:05.930 align:start position:0%
my question is a moment you go you said
that

06:52:05.930 --> 06:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:52:08.390 --> 06:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill presented an anti-vaccine
 
06:52:10.850 --> 06:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
argument however I do not see that in
 
06:52:12.770 --> 06:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
the bill and the prime sponsor did come
 
06:52:14.270 --> 06:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
forward and say that that's not the case
 
06:52:16.070 --> 06:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that this bill is just to ensure
 
06:52:18.650 --> 06:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
that informed consent is provided so
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
wearing the bill could you direct me
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
just so I could see the anti-vaccine
 
06:52:25.310 --> 06:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
well you see that the way that they say
 
06:52:27.890 --> 06:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the none of the language but when you
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
hear them talking
 
06:52:33.350 --> 06:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
you can hear you can see where they're
 
06:52:34.390 --> 06:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
06:52:39.490 --> 06:52:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
we're taking either time you know or or
 
06:52:46.010 --> 06:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
anything like that they keep saying that
 
06:52:48.708 --> 06:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
this is all you know we keep pushing
 
06:52:52.070 --> 06:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
these injections into humans
 
06:52:55.190 --> 06:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
no one is pushing injections into human
 
06:52:57.590 --> 06:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're given the opportunity if they
 
06:52:59.030 --> 06:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to take it they don't have to
 
06:52:59.990 --> 06:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
take it
 
06:53:03.230 --> 06:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
but by saying that we pushing or some
 
06:53:05.208 --> 06:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
kids they they got an email or anything
 
06:53:07.250 --> 06:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
like that the parents had the you know
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to choose not to get the
 
06:53:09.240 --> 06:53:10.368 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to choose not to get the
vaccine

06:53:10.368 --> 06:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
06:53:13.730 --> 06:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up please yes so just to clarify
 
06:53:15.468 --> 06:53:15.478 align:start position:0%
the language is not in the bill but
 
06:53:17.090 --> 06:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
rather in the conversation but again
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
nothing like that is in this bill
 
06:53:21.468 --> 06:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
speaking about the testimony I'm not
 
06:53:25.190 --> 06:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
speaking on the bill and speaking on the
 
06:53:27.670 --> 06:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm saying
 
06:53:30.230 --> 06:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know we should not be saying you
 
06:53:32.750 --> 06:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
know that we're pushing no one is
 
06:53:34.910 --> 06:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
pushing anyone to have vaccines okay
 
06:53:36.830 --> 06:53:36.840 align:start position:0%

representative
 
06:53:43.968 --> 06:53:43.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:43.978 --> 06:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:53:54.590 --> 06:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:56.750 --> 06:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
06:53:59.868 --> 06:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
this committee I would like to support
 
06:54:01.968 --> 06:54:01.978 align:start position:0%
house spell
 
06:54:07.850 --> 06:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:10.490 --> 06:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
5 39 sorry about that it's been a long
 
06:54:10.500 --> 06:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
5 39 sorry about that it's been a long
day

06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:54:15.048 --> 06:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
um I just want to point out that um if
 
06:54:18.948 --> 06:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and meta vaccinations in
 
06:54:21.350 --> 06:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
school is not a medical necessity it is
 
06:54:24.410 --> 06:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
a convenient service I believe that we
 
06:54:26.570 --> 06:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
need to get away from medicalizing our
 
06:54:29.468 --> 06:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
education system and leave that to
 
06:54:32.150 --> 06:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers
 
06:54:35.390 --> 06:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and be to keep this short again I
 
06:54:38.990 --> 06:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
support Bill 539 and I feel that um
 
06:54:42.288 --> 06:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
vaccine should be given at the doctor's
 
06:54:42.298 --> 06:54:43.150 align:start position:0%
vaccine should be given at the doctor's
office

06:54:43.150 --> 06:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:54:46.310 --> 06:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
and as far as convenience you can go to
 
06:54:47.930 --> 06:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
Shaw's Pharmacy and pick up your milk
 
06:54:50.810 --> 06:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
bread and vaccination All in One Stop
 
06:54:54.288 --> 06:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that schools are at a
 
06:54:56.690 --> 06:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
place that vaccination should be given
 
06:54:59.150 --> 06:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
anymore and another point is parents are
 
06:55:01.670 --> 06:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
very nervous and I have had Parents keep
 
06:55:03.350 --> 06:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
their kids home from school on
 
06:55:05.390 --> 06:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination day for fear of their
 
06:55:07.548 --> 06:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
students being vaccinated without their
 
06:55:09.770 --> 06:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge age or on accident and I have
 
06:55:11.930 --> 06:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
had that happen I'm more than one
 
06:55:13.730 --> 06:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
occasion thank you
 
06:55:16.368 --> 06:55:16.378 align:start position:0%
thank you any representative
 
06:55:18.590 --> 06:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Reed
 
06:55:20.090 --> 06:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:55:20.100 --> 06:55:20.868 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

06:55:20.868 --> 06:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:22.968 --> 06:55:22.978 align:start position:0%
you said earlier you were a school nurse
 
06:55:22.978 --> 06:55:24.410 align:start position:0%
you said earlier you were a school nurse
correct

06:55:24.410 --> 06:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
could you possibly see this bill as a
 
06:55:29.770 --> 06:55:29.780 align:start position:0%
way to prevent a school nurse from
 
06:55:32.628 --> 06:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
making a grave error I would call
 
06:55:35.448 --> 06:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
vaccinating a child against their will a
 
06:55:37.490 --> 06:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
grave error and in fact I think we heard
 
06:55:41.150 --> 06:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative cofult say that Dr
 
06:55:43.548 --> 06:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Chan said this should never
 
06:55:46.368 --> 06:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
happen would you agree with that I do I
 
06:55:50.030 --> 06:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
it does set up anytime you administer a
 
06:55:52.070 --> 06:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
medication or injection you know the
 
06:55:53.690 --> 06:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
chance for error is there but with kids
 
06:55:55.670 --> 06:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
in particular especially the younger
 
06:55:58.610 --> 06:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
kids which is the population I worked
 
06:56:00.590 --> 06:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
with mostly when you get a little guy in
 
06:56:02.448 --> 06:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
they're all scared they're nervous and
 
06:56:04.128 --> 06:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
you'll say um you know you have your
 
06:56:06.288 --> 06:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
consent form and everything else and you
 
06:56:08.270 --> 06:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
say is your name Johnny whatever and
 
06:56:10.070 --> 06:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're scared now they'll answer to any
 
06:56:13.910 --> 06:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
name and if and if you don't have some
 
06:56:16.190 --> 06:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
serious checks and balances in place it
 
06:56:18.708 --> 06:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely can happen thank God it's not
 
06:56:21.048 --> 06:56:21.058 align:start position:0%
a common thing but it has happened and
 
06:56:22.730 --> 06:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
the potential is there especially with
 
06:56:25.548 --> 06:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
our younger our younger kids it's
 
06:56:28.850 --> 06:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Belcher thank
 
06:56:30.230 --> 06:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just to follow up on
 
06:56:31.368 --> 06:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
that with your experience as a school
 
06:56:31.378 --> 06:56:32.330 align:start position:0%
that with your experience as a school
nurse

06:56:32.330 --> 06:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
06:56:34.788 --> 06:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
as a school nurse in a typical setting
 
06:56:37.310 --> 06:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
if if there was a problem do you have
 
06:56:38.990 --> 06:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
the equipment on hand to run an
 
06:56:40.850 --> 06:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis or a code or something like
 
06:56:43.190 --> 06:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we do but we don't want to it's a
 
06:56:45.410 --> 06:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
very scary experience it really was and
 
06:56:49.190 --> 06:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
I was hired originally as by the health
 
06:56:50.750 --> 06:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
department so I was a health public
 
06:56:54.770 --> 06:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
health nurse working in a school so I am
 
06:56:57.770 --> 06:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
not anti-vaxx I am pro-vaccine but I do
 
06:57:00.350 --> 06:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
believe it needs to be given in the
 
06:57:02.990 --> 06:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting kids are not little
 
06:57:05.930 --> 06:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
adults you know and for continuity you
 
06:57:07.850 --> 06:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
know those vaccine records follow your
 
06:57:09.410 --> 06:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
kids for the rest of their life and if
 
06:57:11.150 --> 06:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
you get them all over the place there's
 
06:57:13.570 --> 06:57:13.580 align:start position:0%
you know they fall off the scheduling
 
06:57:17.208 --> 06:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
timetable there you lose paperwork if
 
06:57:18.770 --> 06:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
you are consistent in bringing your
 
06:57:20.810 --> 06:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
child to a pediatrician they have the
 
06:57:22.788 --> 06:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
records They know how they tolerate it
 
06:57:25.250 --> 06:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
they know the history that is the ideal
 
06:57:27.530 --> 06:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes we need to forgo
 
06:57:31.010 --> 06:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
convenience for you know the for good
 
06:57:32.708 --> 06:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
health care for our kids
 
06:57:36.230 --> 06:57:36.240 align:start position:0%

06:58:30.590 --> 06:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to talk about the
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
Department's stance on House Bill 539 so
 
06:58:37.610 --> 06:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
if enacted House Bill 539 as we've heard
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
previously would prohibit vaccination
 
06:58:41.150 --> 06:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
clinics during the school day at Public
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
elementary secondary and charter schools
 
06:58:46.368 --> 06:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then it would also
 
06:58:48.708 --> 06:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
implement the requirement of a parent or
 
06:58:50.750 --> 06:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
Guardian being present for the
 
06:58:52.430 --> 06:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination event
 
06:58:54.890 --> 06:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
the decision for vaccination clinics to
 
06:58:56.868 --> 06:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
take place during the school day for
 
06:58:58.910 --> 06:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
staff and students is a local decision
 
06:59:01.548 --> 06:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
made in Partnership by the school in
 
06:59:03.288 --> 06:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
coordination with the remainder of the
 
06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
school community and the regional Public
 
06:59:07.010 --> 06:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
Health Network
 
06:59:08.930 --> 06:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
in addition there are school-based
 
06:59:10.670 --> 06:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics scheduled and
 
06:59:13.490 --> 06:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
coordinated by local and Area Health
 
06:59:15.170 --> 06:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
Care providers
 
06:59:17.750 --> 06:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
the department believes that the
 
06:59:19.490 --> 06:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
scheduling of school-based vaccination
 
06:59:21.890 --> 06:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
events should remain a local decision to
 
06:59:24.048 --> 06:59:24.058 align:start position:0%
allow communities to implement clinics
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
or other services that best meet the
 
06:59:28.910 --> 06:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
needs of their community and to retain
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:59:32.570 --> 06:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
offering vaccination clinics during the
 
06:59:34.490 --> 06:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
school day provides access to annual
 
06:59:37.010 --> 06:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine to children and staff
 
06:59:38.990 --> 06:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
who may not otherwise have access to
 
06:59:41.150 --> 06:59:41.160 align:start position:0%

reasons
 
06:59:44.208 --> 06:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
the model of school-based vaccination
 
06:59:46.610 --> 06:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
clinics allowed for children to receive
 
06:59:49.128 --> 06:59:49.138 align:start position:0%

legal guardian allowing the parent or
 
07:00:00.048 --> 07:00:00.058 align:start position:0%
Guardian to remain in the workforce on
 
07:00:01.310 --> 07:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
that given day
 
07:00:03.830 --> 07:00:03.840 align:start position:0%

staff who choose to receive influenza
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%

07:03:50.208 --> 07:03:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:51.530 --> 07:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:51.540 --> 07:03:52.548 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:03:52.548 --> 07:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:54.770 --> 07:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
for taking my question there's several
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
things I'm confused about
 
07:04:00.128 --> 07:04:00.138 align:start position:0%
what vaccines are children receiving
 
07:04:04.490 --> 07:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
routinely or not routinely what vaccines
 
07:04:07.368 --> 07:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
are children receiving at school
 
07:04:07.378 --> 07:04:08.208 align:start position:0%
are children receiving at school
um

07:04:08.208 --> 07:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:11.270 --> 07:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
how do we fund those vaccines because
 
07:04:13.850 --> 07:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
obviously the children are receiving
 
07:04:15.708 --> 07:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
them at the school at no cost is what
 
07:04:19.750 --> 07:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding and then I'm really
 
07:04:22.368 --> 07:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
confused about this point of
 
07:04:23.930 --> 07:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
distribution and strategic National
 
07:04:26.330 --> 07:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
stockpile training and exercise
 
07:04:29.208 --> 07:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm wondering how
 
07:04:33.650 --> 07:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
that occurs in the school like what
 
07:04:35.570 --> 07:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the first
 
07:04:35.580 --> 07:04:36.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the first
question

07:04:36.948 --> 07:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:04:40.010 --> 07:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the school-based vaccination clinics
 
07:04:41.330 --> 07:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
that are coordinated by the regional
 
07:04:43.850 --> 07:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
public health networks historically
 
07:04:47.750 --> 07:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
offered influenza vaccine
 
07:04:49.548 --> 07:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
last year was the first year that
 
07:04:53.030 --> 07:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine was also offered at the
 
07:04:55.128 --> 07:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
school-based clinics however going
 
07:04:58.490 --> 07:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
forward due to utilization demand and
 
07:05:00.170 --> 07:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
the commercialization of covid-19
 
07:05:02.810 --> 07:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
vaccine going forward the department
 
07:05:07.010 --> 07:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
only intends to offer influenza vaccine
 
07:05:10.010 --> 07:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
the second question on how this is paid
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
for the regional public health networks
 
07:05:16.610 --> 07:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
receive multiple funding sources one of
 
07:05:18.110 --> 07:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
the largest ones is the public health
 
07:05:21.048 --> 07:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness Grant and we're
 
07:05:22.910 --> 07:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
univer where New Hampshire is a
 
07:05:25.670 --> 07:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
universal vaccine state where anyone
 
07:05:28.190 --> 07:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 is able to receive
 
07:05:31.850 --> 07:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
any asip or CDC recommended vaccine at
 
07:05:35.990 --> 07:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
no cost to them we use General funds to
 
07:05:39.170 --> 07:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
purchase the influenza vaccine and the
 
07:05:40.448 --> 07:05:40.458 align:start position:0%
last question
 
07:05:43.968 --> 07:05:43.978 align:start position:0%
in the point of distribution and
 
07:05:46.968 --> 07:05:46.978 align:start position:0%
strategic National stockpile as part of
 
07:05:48.590 --> 07:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
being a grant recipient for the public
 
07:05:51.410 --> 07:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
health emergency preparedness Grant we
 
07:05:54.110 --> 07:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
have to meet certain requirements so an
 
07:05:56.690 --> 07:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
example outside of vaccines for point of
 
07:05:59.810 --> 07:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
distribution this goes back to
 
07:06:02.510 --> 07:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
um in the event of a bioterrorism attack
 
07:06:04.548 --> 07:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
and we have to distribute large
 
07:06:06.830 --> 07:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
quantities of an antibiotic due to
 
07:06:11.570 --> 07:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
Anthrax or a radiological event like a
 
07:06:14.170 --> 07:06:14.180 align:start position:0%
dirty bomb or a
 
07:06:16.910 --> 07:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
incident at a nuclear power plant and we
 
07:06:19.250 --> 07:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
have to distribute large quantities of
 
07:06:21.890 --> 07:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
potassium iodide the regional public
 
07:06:23.570 --> 07:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
health networks
 
07:06:26.270 --> 07:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
exercise and train to do point of
 
07:06:28.490 --> 07:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
distribution of vents
 
07:06:31.310 --> 07:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
and by conducting annual school-based
 
07:06:33.830 --> 07:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
clinics we can take that and show that
 
07:06:35.690 --> 07:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
back to the federal government to say
 
07:06:37.548 --> 07:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
yes we are proficient in performing
 
07:06:39.830 --> 07:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
these activities because as we know the
 
07:06:43.010 --> 07:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
time to actually exercise and train is
 
07:06:45.110 --> 07:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
not during one of those crises like a
 
07:06:49.548 --> 07:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
bio terrorism attack or a nuclear event
 
07:06:51.410 --> 07:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden oh I'm sorry
 
07:06:53.628 --> 07:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
and you want to follow up you you had
 
07:06:57.708 --> 07:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:59.690 --> 07:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
07:07:02.208 --> 07:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for uh taking my
 
07:07:03.708 --> 07:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
question and actually addressing the
 
07:07:05.930 --> 07:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
point of distribution I've participated
 
07:07:08.690 --> 07:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
in two pod drills in my career
 
07:07:10.968 --> 07:07:10.978 align:start position:0%
and they are held in a high school if
 
07:07:13.490 --> 07:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
this bill were passed would that mean a
 
07:07:16.250 --> 07:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
pod could not be held in the high school
 
07:07:18.590 --> 07:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
or a school building
 
07:07:20.990 --> 07:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think as the bill is written and I
 
07:07:22.850 --> 07:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
believe uh representative kofal also
 
07:07:25.190 --> 07:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
briefly touched upon this
 
07:07:28.010 --> 07:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
it appears that it would limit it to
 
07:07:31.010 --> 07:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
potentially just vaccines but it does
 
07:07:32.150 --> 07:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
depend on what the medical
 
07:07:33.890 --> 07:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
countermeasure to
 
07:07:36.708 --> 07:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
the the Pod need would be
 
07:07:41.690 --> 07:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:43.368 --> 07:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
07:07:46.128 --> 07:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
taking my question and being here today
 
07:07:49.190 --> 07:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm based upon your testimony
 
07:07:51.230 --> 07:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
my presumption is I've got two questions
 
07:07:52.910 --> 07:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
my presumption is
 
07:07:55.610 --> 07:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
that you do agree with the issue of the
 
07:07:58.788 --> 07:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
informed consent prior to any vaccine
 
07:08:01.850 --> 07:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
giving to a student is that correct
 
07:08:03.830 --> 07:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
I believe informed consent can be
 
07:08:05.570 --> 07:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
obtained in different ways yes okay
 
07:08:08.150 --> 07:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
second question I have we we've heard
 
07:08:11.030 --> 07:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
some incidents of where children have
 
07:08:15.288 --> 07:08:15.298 align:start position:0%
been given vaccines without the parents
 
07:08:18.410 --> 07:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
knowledge Etc and some unintended
 
07:08:20.690 --> 07:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of reaction to
 
07:08:23.208 --> 07:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
whatever the vaccine might be do you
 
07:08:24.948 --> 07:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
have any numbers or any data or any
 
07:08:27.770 --> 07:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
metrics that would give this committee a
 
07:08:29.448 --> 07:08:29.458 align:start position:0%
little more background to what that
 
07:08:32.150 --> 07:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
incident rate might be
 
07:08:35.510 --> 07:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
so to the knowledge of the department we
 
07:08:37.368 --> 07:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
are aware of
 
07:08:39.530 --> 07:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
um the two incidences here in New
 
07:08:41.150 --> 07:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that were
 
07:08:45.590 --> 07:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
um reported in 2022 however uh to our
 
07:08:47.868 --> 07:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge those did not include covid-19
 
07:08:47.878 --> 07:08:49.190 align:start position:0%
knowledge those did not include covid-19
vaccine

07:08:49.190 --> 07:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
07:08:51.468 --> 07:08:51.478 align:start position:0%
so two instances then correct thank you
 
07:08:53.448 --> 07:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
very much if I could just follow up on
 
07:08:55.190 --> 07:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
something you just said
 
07:08:57.830 --> 07:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
um you said informed could consent could
 
07:09:00.410 --> 07:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
be obtained in different ways could you
 
07:09:03.350 --> 07:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
expand on that I'm not sure
 
07:09:06.590 --> 07:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
um what ways you uh have in mind for uh
 
07:09:08.990 --> 07:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
obtaining informed consent so the the
 
07:09:11.090 --> 07:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
current process and procedure is
 
07:09:13.190 --> 07:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
outlined by uh the regional public
 
07:09:15.170 --> 07:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
health networks and the contractors is
 
07:09:18.468 --> 07:09:18.478 align:start position:0%
to obtain written consent
 
07:09:21.410 --> 07:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
there is Provisions in the policy and
 
07:09:23.690 --> 07:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
procedure from the contractor that also
 
07:09:27.170 --> 07:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
outline if there's questions or if the
 
07:09:29.448 --> 07:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
consent is outside a certain date window
 
07:09:31.490 --> 07:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
if they can call a parent and obtain it
 
07:09:34.610 --> 07:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
verbally so that that is to clarify your
 
07:09:39.288 --> 07:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
question that's that's in rules from who
 
07:09:41.570 --> 07:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's part of the policies and procedures
 
07:09:44.208 --> 07:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
that the uh either the regional public
 
07:09:46.128 --> 07:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
health networks or the medical director
 
07:09:48.288 --> 07:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
who's operating the clinic has in place
 
07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
thank you I just yeah I just sorry this
 
07:09:53.330 --> 07:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
is Abby Rogers I just wanted to add in
 
07:09:56.150 --> 07:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
that parental consent is of the utmost
 
07:09:58.270 --> 07:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
importance when it comes to
 
07:10:00.708 --> 07:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics in schools and it's
 
07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
taken very seriously and it's obtained
 
07:10:05.890 --> 07:10:05.900 align:start position:0%
by writing and writing
 
07:10:09.530 --> 07:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative dry
 
07:10:12.770 --> 07:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh could
 
07:10:15.708 --> 07:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
a clinic conducted outside that window
 
07:10:18.770 --> 07:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
like Beyond two hours after or before or
 
07:10:20.750 --> 07:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
on a Saturday
 
07:10:22.190 --> 07:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
um fulfill the requirements for
 
07:10:25.730 --> 07:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness training
 
07:10:26.990 --> 07:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
it could potentially fulfill those
 
07:10:29.208 --> 07:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
requirements yes
 
07:10:31.670 --> 07:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
07:10:33.170 --> 07:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you both
 
07:10:34.850 --> 07:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
07:10:37.610 --> 07:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
is there any data available
 
07:10:39.770 --> 07:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking it's probably more specific
 
07:10:41.510 --> 07:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
to influenza
 
07:10:41.520 --> 07:10:44.030 align:start position:0%
to influenza
on

07:10:44.030 --> 07:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:10:46.788 --> 07:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
What proportion of people who would be
 
07:10:48.590 --> 07:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
eligible and appropriate for vaccines
 
07:10:50.570 --> 07:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
get them or don't get them
 
07:10:53.030 --> 07:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
related to these clinics in other words
 
07:10:55.208 --> 07:10:55.218 align:start position:0%
how much does convenient access
 
07:10:59.530 --> 07:10:59.540 align:start position:0%
influence the administration of vaccines
 
07:11:03.350 --> 07:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so those data
 
07:11:06.350 --> 07:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
points are would probably not be readily
 
07:11:09.048 --> 07:11:09.058 align:start position:0%
available however when the school-based
 
07:11:13.490 --> 07:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
clinics were first developed the focus
 
07:11:17.090 --> 07:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
and Target populations were schools who
 
07:11:19.548 --> 07:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
have higher rates of free or reduced
 
07:11:22.850 --> 07:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
lunch school plans and that was heavily
 
07:11:25.368 --> 07:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
rooted in the socioeconomic barriers and
 
07:11:28.430 --> 07:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:31.010 --> 07:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
or follow
 
07:11:36.948 --> 07:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
so did did we see an increase in
 
07:11:38.930 --> 07:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
um people getting vaccination and what
 
07:11:40.430 --> 07:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
you just referenced with the
 
07:11:42.350 --> 07:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
population's higher incidence of brain
 
07:11:43.548 --> 07:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch when the clinics were
 
07:11:43.558 --> 07:11:44.510 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch when the clinics were
started

07:11:44.510 --> 07:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
started
 
07:11:47.868 --> 07:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
so that was the original uh metric that
 
07:11:49.730 --> 07:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
was put in place when school-based
 
07:11:52.730 --> 07:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
clinics first started we you know we are
 
07:11:54.170 --> 07:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
certainly open to having discussion to
 
07:11:56.448 --> 07:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
figure out if that is the best metric
 
07:11:59.570 --> 07:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
going forward but as far as school-based
 
07:12:02.690 --> 07:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
clinics in general if you Trend it over
 
07:12:05.868 --> 07:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
the last five years we have seen a
 
07:12:05.878 --> 07:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
the last five years we have seen a
decrease

07:12:07.490 --> 07:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
07:12:11.030 --> 07:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:13.670 --> 07:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to go
 
07:12:16.548 --> 07:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
back to a moment ago when you said that
 
07:12:18.590 --> 07:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
the federal training requirements are
 
07:12:21.530 --> 07:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
being met through these vaccination
 
07:12:23.330 --> 07:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
clinics was that was that did I hear
 
07:12:26.990 --> 07:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
that correctly yes may I uh follow up
 
07:12:27.000 --> 07:12:29.150 align:start position:0%
that correctly yes may I uh follow up
um

07:12:29.150 --> 07:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:31.850 --> 07:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
is it even remotely conceivable that
 
07:12:33.468 --> 07:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
we're allowing a federal training
 
07:12:35.390 --> 07:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
requirement around terrorism to distract
 
07:12:37.070 --> 07:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
people who were administering vaccines
 
07:12:39.288 --> 07:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
to children
 
07:12:41.990 --> 07:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the question please if
 
07:12:43.310 --> 07:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're conducting this training
 
07:12:44.830 --> 07:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that is a federal
 
07:12:47.708 --> 07:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
bioterrorism training requirement while
 
07:12:51.468 --> 07:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
simultaneously vaccinating children in
 
07:12:53.810 --> 07:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
schools is there even a remote chance
 
07:12:56.208 --> 07:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
that these Federal requirements this
 
07:12:57.770 --> 07:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
training could be distracting them from
 
07:13:00.830 --> 07:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
the job of vaccinating children so thank
 
07:13:03.350 --> 07:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's
 
07:13:05.990 --> 07:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's approached in the opposite way so
 
07:13:08.390 --> 07:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we have we've been conducting
 
07:13:11.628 --> 07:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
these clinics for a number of years and
 
07:13:13.850 --> 07:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
as the public health emergency
 
07:13:15.708 --> 07:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
preparedness Grant and those Federal
 
07:13:18.650 --> 07:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
requirements have evolved we have come
 
07:13:20.930 --> 07:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
to a place where we don't have to do
 
07:13:23.090 --> 07:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
something separate we're able to take
 
07:13:25.070 --> 07:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we're currently we are doing and
 
07:13:26.868 --> 07:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
what we've done for the last few decades
 
07:13:28.750 --> 07:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
and just show the federal government
 
07:13:31.250 --> 07:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this we don't need
 
07:13:34.670 --> 07:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
to do a separate event to meet these
 
07:13:36.948 --> 07:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you
 
07:13:39.410 --> 07:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative Balboni
 
07:13:42.708 --> 07:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just trying to get an idea of
 
07:13:45.410 --> 07:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
um two things like how many schools
 
07:13:47.208 --> 07:13:47.218 align:start position:0%
participate in these clinics throughout
 
07:13:49.490 --> 07:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
the state and how often those clinics
 
07:13:51.590 --> 07:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
would be held
 
07:13:54.530 --> 07:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
sure thanks for the question so the
 
07:13:57.708 --> 07:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:00.410 --> 07:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's almost twofold so some some
 
07:14:02.030 --> 07:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
Regional public health networks have
 
07:14:05.030 --> 07:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
reported the number of school districts
 
07:14:07.368 --> 07:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
that have participated others have
 
07:14:09.288 --> 07:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
reported the individual number of
 
07:14:10.670 --> 07:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
schools and I can certainly follow up
 
07:14:12.230 --> 07:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
with the actual number of schools if
 
07:14:14.090 --> 07:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
you'd like and then as far as the
 
07:14:17.208 --> 07:14:17.218 align:start position:0%
frequency that goes back to the local
 
07:14:19.250 --> 07:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
level decision making so the regional
 
07:14:21.468 --> 07:14:21.478 align:start position:0%
Public Health Network engages the school
 
07:14:23.868 --> 07:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
and the school Community they may want
 
07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
one clinic or they may want several
 
07:14:28.850 --> 07:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
clinics so the the frequency at the
 
07:14:30.350 --> 07:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
school level does vary
 
07:14:32.150 --> 07:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would appreciate the
 
07:14:34.670 --> 07:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
number if you get a chance thank you uh
 
07:14:36.288 --> 07:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
sorry just to follow up with some
 
07:14:37.670 --> 07:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
information related to the
 
07:14:39.770 --> 07:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
representatives question too just for
 
07:14:41.628 --> 07:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
the committee that in
 
07:14:44.930 --> 07:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
um 2022 I can we can say that there were
 
07:14:47.030 --> 07:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
over four four thousand students
 
07:14:49.548 --> 07:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
received the um influenza vaccination so
 
07:14:50.690 --> 07:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
just to give you a number of how many
 
07:14:53.030 --> 07:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
students utilize and or have access to
 
07:14:56.708 --> 07:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
to that uh to that um preventable
 
07:15:00.110 --> 07:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination for communicable disease
 
07:15:01.548 --> 07:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
07:15:04.010 --> 07:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
07:15:06.288 --> 07:15:06.298 align:start position:0%
just one more could you just speak in
 
07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
broader terms to the utilization of
 
07:15:10.850 --> 07:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
vaccines in New Hampshire compared to
 
07:15:10.860 --> 07:15:13.548 align:start position:0%
vaccines in New Hampshire compared to
nationally

07:15:13.548 --> 07:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:15.590 --> 07:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question I I
 
07:15:18.170 --> 07:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
would need more context if we're
 
07:15:20.810 --> 07:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
speaking a specific population or a
 
07:15:22.670 --> 07:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
specific vaccine
 
07:15:24.770 --> 07:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
well I could just narrow it down to
 
07:15:24.780 --> 07:15:26.448 align:start position:0%
well I could just narrow it down to
influenza

07:15:26.448 --> 07:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
07:15:29.930 --> 07:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
um so are we trending differently than
 
07:15:33.110 --> 07:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
nationally over say the last 10 years or
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
something like that because so thank you
 
07:15:37.670 --> 07:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
again for the question and follow-up to
 
07:15:38.990 --> 07:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
07:15:41.150 --> 07:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
um we do track Trends down to the
 
07:15:43.070 --> 07:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
specific vaccine specific age group
 
07:15:45.650 --> 07:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
level uh specific to school-based
 
07:15:48.830 --> 07:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines what I can say is
 
07:15:51.890 --> 07:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
um compared to the previous year we
 
07:15:53.868 --> 07:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
actually did see a slight about a two
 
07:15:56.270 --> 07:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
percent increase in the number of uh
 
07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
parents wishing to have their student
 
07:16:01.190 --> 07:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinated at a school-based clinic
 
07:16:04.490 --> 07:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and this would be a much broader
 
07:16:07.128 --> 07:16:07.138 align:start position:0%
conversation we've seen rates increase
 
07:16:09.048 --> 07:16:09.058 align:start position:0%
and decrease depending on the vaccine
 
07:16:12.288 --> 07:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
itself but for the most part and
 
07:16:15.288 --> 07:16:15.298 align:start position:0%
generally speaking in the Northeast we
 
07:16:17.750 --> 07:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
tend to have very stable rates over long
 
07:16:19.368 --> 07:16:19.378 align:start position:0%
periods of time
 
07:16:21.350 --> 07:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
07:16:23.990 --> 07:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you just a follow-up of your
 
07:16:27.170 --> 07:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
question from Robert the bear uh when
 
07:16:29.090 --> 07:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
parents bring their youngsters to a
 
07:16:31.430 --> 07:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
clinic for vaccination is a in our
 
07:16:33.350 --> 07:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
school-based program it's ongoing is it
 
07:16:34.610 --> 07:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
possible for parents to get vaccinated
 
07:16:38.030 --> 07:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:41.208 --> 07:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
we do not turn down a opportunity to
 
07:16:45.110 --> 07:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinate so yes because a little quick
 
07:16:45.120 --> 07:16:46.330 align:start position:0%
vaccinate so yes because a little quick
please

07:16:46.330 --> 07:16:46.340 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:16:50.230 --> 07:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
based on that do parents participate
 
07:16:50.240 --> 07:16:51.890 align:start position:0%
based on that do parents participate
foreign

07:16:51.890 --> 07:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:16:55.190 --> 07:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
depending on how the clinic is set up so
 
07:16:57.410 --> 07:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
if a if it
 
07:16:59.570 --> 07:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
typically in other folks have mentioned
 
07:17:02.570 --> 07:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know how do the logistics work
 
07:17:04.850 --> 07:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
for a parent coming in in the middle of
 
07:17:06.890 --> 07:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
the school day right I don't see that
 
07:17:08.570 --> 07:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
likely again that's something controlled
 
07:17:11.090 --> 07:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
at the local school level if it's a
 
07:17:13.368 --> 07:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
weekend event and parents show up
 
07:17:14.868 --> 07:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
because there's another event at the
 
07:17:17.150 --> 07:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
school then sure then yes thank you so
 
07:17:21.590 --> 07:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:24.530 --> 07:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you've
 
07:17:28.190 --> 07:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
referred a couple times to if we reduce
 
07:17:30.610 --> 07:17:30.620 align:start position:0%
if we do away with these clinics during
 
07:17:33.230 --> 07:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
school hours or shortly before and after
 
07:17:35.448 --> 07:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
school hours that it would have put an
 
07:17:39.110 --> 07:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
increased load on other health care
 
07:17:44.530 --> 07:17:44.540 align:start position:0%
facilities are you talking about
 
07:17:47.030 --> 07:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and grocery stores where
 
07:17:50.090 --> 07:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
people also go and get vaccines or are
 
07:17:52.368 --> 07:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
you talking about it forces people to
 
07:17:54.190 --> 07:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
then go doctors
 
07:17:57.230 --> 07:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh so
 
07:17:58.730 --> 07:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
from our perspective at the department
 
07:18:01.430 --> 07:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
we see as my colleague Abby Rogers
 
07:18:02.930 --> 07:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned last year there was
 
07:18:05.448 --> 07:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
approximately 4 400 almost 4 500
 
07:18:08.690 --> 07:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
children who received a vaccine at a
 
07:18:10.030 --> 07:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
school-based clinic
 
07:18:14.150 --> 07:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
those four thousand five thousand plus
 
07:18:17.330 --> 07:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
people now need to schedule an
 
07:18:19.910 --> 07:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
appointment at a pediatrician or go to a
 
07:18:19.920 --> 07:18:21.048 align:start position:0%
appointment at a pediatrician or go to a
pharmacy

07:18:21.048 --> 07:18:21.058 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
07:18:24.288 --> 07:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
during a time where there are critical
 
07:18:26.628 --> 07:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Staffing shortages in all of
 
07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:31.128 --> 07:18:31.138 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:18:34.070 --> 07:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um did either of you have a
 
07:18:35.930 --> 07:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
further comment to one of the prior
 
07:18:39.170 --> 07:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
questions yes thanks I had a comment um
 
07:18:40.730 --> 07:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
on a question that was asked previously
 
07:18:42.770 --> 07:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
just to share that the vaccination rates
 
07:18:43.910 --> 07:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
for for
 
07:18:46.190 --> 07:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
um Pediatrics I mean it's a pediatric
 
07:18:48.350 --> 07:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
population is relatively high in New
 
07:18:50.030 --> 07:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we did see a dip during
 
07:18:52.190 --> 07:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 during the pandemic due to
 
07:18:53.690 --> 07:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
access due to folks not being able to
 
07:18:56.628 --> 07:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
get to the doctor so the um you know the
 
07:18:58.190 --> 07:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
the school health space the school
 
07:18:59.930 --> 07:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
health clinics really are a really great
 
07:19:03.230 --> 07:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
point of access for for kids uh to get
 
07:19:04.490 --> 07:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
vaccinations when their parents can
 
07:19:06.288 --> 07:19:06.298 align:start position:0%
consent to that
 
07:19:08.628 --> 07:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
um it broadens the ability of the school
 
07:19:10.310 --> 07:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
Community to stay healthy to have kids
 
07:19:11.868 --> 07:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
in school to have parents be in work and
 
07:19:13.548 --> 07:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
not have to be home with a sick child
 
07:19:16.070 --> 07:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
and also um that immunity spreads beyond
 
07:19:18.350 --> 07:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
the student population to the staff and
 
07:19:20.810 --> 07:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
also to the broader community
 
07:19:23.448 --> 07:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative pedernal
 
07:19:25.548 --> 07:19:25.558 align:start position:0%

you
 
07:19:34.430 --> 07:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just have a quick a quick question
 
07:19:35.930 --> 07:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
how long have we been doing this in
 
07:19:39.468 --> 07:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
schools wait how many years so the
 
07:19:41.810 --> 07:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
school-based vaccination includes well
 
07:19:44.628 --> 07:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we have been doing
 
07:19:46.968 --> 07:19:46.978 align:start position:0%
school-based vaccination clinics
 
07:19:46.978 --> 07:19:47.628 align:start position:0%
school-based vaccination clinics
um

07:19:47.628 --> 07:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:50.390 --> 07:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
we can go as far back as the 1950s and
 
07:19:53.330 --> 07:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
60s when we were doing polio vaccines
 
07:19:55.850 --> 07:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
um this specific school-based Clinic
 
07:19:57.708 --> 07:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
program administered by a regional
 
07:20:01.010 --> 07:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
public health networks came shortly on
 
07:20:05.510 --> 07:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
the heels of the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.
 
07:20:05.520 --> 07:20:06.288 align:start position:0%
the heels of the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.
okay

07:20:06.288 --> 07:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:20:08.150 --> 07:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
07:20:11.270 --> 07:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you what uh recourse does a parent
 
07:20:11.280 --> 07:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
thank you what uh recourse does a parent
have

07:20:12.230 --> 07:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:20:15.230 --> 07:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
if in fact a vaccine is given to a child
 
07:20:24.730 --> 07:20:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:27.650 --> 07:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh as
 
07:20:30.708 --> 07:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative Koval referenced
 
07:20:33.170 --> 07:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
um the comments of Dr Ben Chan who had
 
07:20:35.390 --> 07:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
participated in the study committee on
 
07:20:37.490 --> 07:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
the listing of immunizations for
 
07:20:38.930 --> 07:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
children School requirements which was
 
07:20:41.030 --> 07:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
held in the fall by the legislature that
 
07:20:42.890 --> 07:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
that event that you describe as a never
 
07:20:45.830 --> 07:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
event uh that should having a child
 
07:20:47.628 --> 07:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinated without parental consent
 
07:20:49.570 --> 07:20:49.580 align:start position:0%
should never happen
 
07:20:52.968 --> 07:20:52.978 align:start position:0%
but as we know in medical sometimes in
 
07:20:55.968 --> 07:20:55.978 align:start position:0%
medical situations administratively you
 
07:20:59.150 --> 07:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
know events such as this can happen it
 
07:21:02.090 --> 07:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
is you know the delivery of medical
 
07:21:05.330 --> 07:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
operations medical oversight delivery of
 
07:21:07.190 --> 07:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
medical Medical Care can be complicated
 
07:21:10.368 --> 07:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
and complex because an error did happen
 
07:21:11.690 --> 07:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
in the case is described a
 
07:21:13.128 --> 07:21:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative kovald which I can't
 
07:21:16.190 --> 07:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
speak to the goal is to improve the
 
07:21:17.868 --> 07:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
delivery of care and have a better
 
07:21:19.670 --> 07:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
process in place to prevent errors in
 
07:21:22.910 --> 07:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the future so any any child that was
 
07:21:24.770 --> 07:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
vaccinated without proper parental
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
consent that I would assume I'm not you
 
07:21:28.850 --> 07:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
know I'm not a legal person but I would
 
07:21:30.288 --> 07:21:30.298 align:start position:0%
say that that parent would have a
 
07:21:31.610 --> 07:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
recourse to have further discussions
 
07:21:34.250 --> 07:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the clinic with the
 
07:21:35.690 --> 07:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
administrators of that clinic and and
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly with their child's provider
 
07:21:39.830 --> 07:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
um to kind of look to next next steps in
 
07:21:42.170 --> 07:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
that Arena
 
07:21:42.180 --> 07:21:44.208 align:start position:0%
that Arena
representative

07:21:44.208 --> 07:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:21:47.350 --> 07:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
one more quick question as
 
07:21:50.330 --> 07:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
unelected bureaucrats are you in the
 
07:21:52.070 --> 07:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
position to be making a statement
 
07:21:54.890 --> 07:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
supporting or opposing legislation
 
07:21:54.900 --> 07:21:57.788 align:start position:0%
supporting or opposing legislation
foreign

07:21:57.788 --> 07:21:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:00.110 --> 07:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
sure I would say that as representative
 
07:22:01.190 --> 07:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
07:22:03.230 --> 07:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
Services we frequently come to
 
07:22:05.270 --> 07:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
committees to inform the legislature on
 
07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh legislation before the Committees
 
07:22:08.510 --> 07:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're here today to provide information
 
07:22:10.250 --> 07:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
we are taking a position on this bill
 
07:22:13.190 --> 07:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
because as we are representative our
 
07:22:15.048 --> 07:22:15.058 align:start position:0%
mission for the Department of Health and
 
07:22:16.610 --> 07:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
Human Services is to protect public
 
07:22:19.968 --> 07:22:19.978 align:start position:0%
health and we feel that by restricting
 
07:22:23.208 --> 07:22:23.218 align:start position:0%
access for Pediatric patients in the
 
07:22:24.770 --> 07:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
school Clinic if their parents have
 
07:22:26.270 --> 07:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
decided this is the best place for them
 
07:22:27.830 --> 07:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated and if they signed
 
07:22:30.468 --> 07:22:30.478 align:start position:0%
proper consent that is not a benefit to
 
07:22:32.448 --> 07:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
Public Health or to a healthy Community
 
07:22:34.670 --> 07:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
or immunity
 
07:22:37.430 --> 07:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you see no further questions thank
 
07:22:39.590 --> 07:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony and uh
 
07:22:41.690 --> 07:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
mail comment I think sure you want to
 
07:22:42.890 --> 07:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
add one thing
 
07:22:44.570 --> 07:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
um representative Ladd had asked a
 
07:22:45.948 --> 07:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
question I believe of Representative
 
07:22:48.350 --> 07:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
Cole fault around
 
07:22:51.048 --> 07:22:51.058 align:start position:0%
um the parental who can give who can
 
07:22:53.510 --> 07:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
give consent right so according to the
 
07:22:55.250 --> 07:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
National Children's vaccine injury act
 
07:22:58.250 --> 07:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
which is a federal act only parents or
 
07:22:59.570 --> 07:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
legal Guardians May consent to
 
07:23:02.150 --> 07:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination for their children
 
07:23:04.968 --> 07:23:04.978 align:start position:0%

07:23:10.190 --> 07:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
we have uh quite a few cards left to go
 
07:23:13.070 --> 07:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
so um you know let's keep our questions
 
07:23:15.590 --> 07:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
short from here on and uh hopefully the
 
07:23:17.570 --> 07:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
testimony as well

um The Honorable Don Johnson from
 
07:23:19.740 --> 07:23:30.770 align:start position:0%
um The Honorable Don Johnson from
Laconia

07:23:30.770 --> 07:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:30.780 --> 07:23:32.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:23:32.410 --> 07:23:32.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:34.910 --> 07:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my name is John Johnson
 
07:23:38.868 --> 07:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'm from Laconia I'm here as a parent I
 
07:23:41.810 --> 07:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
know as a parent I have taken the steps
 
07:23:43.850 --> 07:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
to get the vaccines that my children
 
07:23:46.788 --> 07:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
need I also know that when I sign a
 
07:23:48.830 --> 07:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
consent form I know that my child will
 
07:23:51.170 --> 07:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
get it but I do not always trust the
 
07:23:53.330 --> 07:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
school district to not follow through
 
07:23:55.510 --> 07:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
when I do not follow a consent form
 
07:23:58.250 --> 07:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
there has been instances I know across
 
07:24:00.110 --> 07:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
the state and I know from personal
 
07:24:02.390 --> 07:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
experience I've even kept my kids out of
 
07:24:05.270 --> 07:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
a class out of school because of surveys
 
07:24:07.490 --> 07:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
not being followed when I said my child
 
07:24:09.110 --> 07:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
would not take this survey and they've
 
07:24:11.390 --> 07:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
tried to force my child to take a survey
 
07:24:15.170 --> 07:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
if I can't ask them to follow along with
 
07:24:17.890 --> 07:24:17.900 align:start position:0%
a simple survey that my child is not
 
07:24:19.910 --> 07:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to take
 
07:24:21.948 --> 07:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
how can I trust them
 
07:24:26.628 --> 07:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
to not also follow a non-consent form
 
07:24:29.270 --> 07:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that
 
07:24:32.750 --> 07:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
we need to offer these clinics I am not
 
07:24:34.610 --> 07:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
against vaccines my kids are vaccinated
 
07:24:36.170 --> 07:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
to a point
 
07:24:38.810 --> 07:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time offering these
 
07:24:38.820 --> 07:24:39.830 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time offering these
clinics

07:24:39.830 --> 07:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
07:24:43.190 --> 07:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
during school hours in is in intrusive
 
07:24:45.410 --> 07:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
and interruptive to our students
 
07:24:47.868 --> 07:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
education we are there for our teachers
 
07:24:51.770 --> 07:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
to teach them to learn read write and
 
07:24:55.548 --> 07:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
arithmetic not to force or push a
 
07:24:59.448 --> 07:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:02.570 --> 07:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions from the
 
07:25:06.110 --> 07:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:11.030 --> 07:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:13.548 --> 07:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman may I respectfully see my
 
07:25:15.530 --> 07:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
time to my friend a neighbor who has to
 
07:25:17.288 --> 07:25:17.298 align:start position:0%
leave at 4 30.
 
07:25:20.090 --> 07:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
sure does she have a card up here yes
 
07:25:31.070 --> 07:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:32.750 --> 07:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:25:34.670 --> 07:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
um my name is Risa Evans and I'm an
 
07:25:37.730 --> 07:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
attorney and I live in Kentucky
 
07:25:40.070 --> 07:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to urge you to vote for
 
07:25:42.410 --> 07:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
this bill for three reasons in addition
 
07:25:43.910 --> 07:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
to some of the many good reasons that
 
07:25:45.830 --> 07:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
have already been offered
 
07:25:48.110 --> 07:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
first we know from experience that
 
07:25:50.810 --> 07:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
mistakes are inevitable mistakes were
 
07:25:54.110 --> 07:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
made in Nashua they were made in
 
07:25:54.120 --> 07:25:55.490 align:start position:0%
made in Nashua they were made in
Rochester

07:25:55.490 --> 07:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
07:25:58.190 --> 07:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
they were made in Vermont where a
 
07:26:00.830 --> 07:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
six-year-old child was given a covid-19
 
07:26:04.190 --> 07:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
injection without parental consent and
 
07:26:06.530 --> 07:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
over the child's own objections at the
 
07:26:06.540 --> 07:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
over the child's own objections at the
time

07:26:07.990 --> 07:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
across the United States the vaccine
 
07:26:14.330 --> 07:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events reporting system includes
 
07:26:17.448 --> 07:26:17.458 align:start position:0%
reports of over ten thousand vaccine
 
07:26:19.910 --> 07:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
Administration errors of various sorts
 
07:26:23.570 --> 07:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
since October of 2021 for children ages
 
07:26:26.330 --> 07:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
5 to 17 for the covid-19 injections
 
07:26:26.340 --> 07:26:27.948 align:start position:0%
5 to 17 for the covid-19 injections
alone

07:26:27.948 --> 07:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
alone
 
07:26:30.170 --> 07:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
so mistakes have been made and no matter
 
07:26:32.570 --> 07:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
how well intended we are
 
07:26:34.670 --> 07:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
and regardless of the fail safes that we
 
07:26:38.628 --> 07:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
put in place mistakes will be made again
 
07:26:40.430 --> 07:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
so that brings me to my second point
 
07:26:42.410 --> 07:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
which is that because mistakes are
 
07:26:46.368 --> 07:26:46.378 align:start position:0%
inevitable injuries are also inevitable
 
07:26:48.468 --> 07:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
most obvious are possible physical
 
07:26:50.448 --> 07:26:50.458 align:start position:0%
injuries to children who receive
 
07:26:53.708 --> 07:26:53.718 align:start position:0%
unwanted and unconsented to vaccinations
 
07:26:56.628 --> 07:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully mild physical injuries but
 
07:26:58.610 --> 07:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
potentially severe and even deadly
 
07:27:01.548 --> 07:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
depending on the reason for the for the
 
07:27:03.948 --> 07:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
child's parents you know having objected
 
07:27:05.690 --> 07:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
to vaccination in the first place
 
07:27:07.490 --> 07:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
whatever the underlying medical
 
07:27:08.930 --> 07:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
07:27:12.230 --> 07:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
less obvious but also important Are
 
07:27:14.510 --> 07:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
Spiritual injuries to children and
 
07:27:17.330 --> 07:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
parents who's sincerely held religious
 
07:27:19.310 --> 07:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
beliefs preclude introducting
 
07:27:21.590 --> 07:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
introducing certain substances into the
 
07:27:23.990 --> 07:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
body and who experience unwanted
 
07:27:26.990 --> 07:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
injections as desecrations
 
07:27:29.750 --> 07:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
also less obvious but also important are
 
07:27:31.910 --> 07:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
what I would refer to as dignitary
 
07:27:34.788 --> 07:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
injuries the types of injuries that are
 
07:27:36.350 --> 07:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
recognized by New Hampshire's simple
 
07:27:39.288 --> 07:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
assault statute which precludes any
 
07:27:42.288 --> 07:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching recognizing that
 
07:27:45.110 --> 07:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching violates a fundamental
 
07:27:48.590 --> 07:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
right of personal bodily sovereignty
 
07:27:50.330 --> 07:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
so that brings me to the third point
 
07:27:52.368 --> 07:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
which is that while mistakes are
 
07:27:55.430 --> 07:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
inevitable and injuries are inevitable
 
07:27:57.890 --> 07:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
remedies for those injuries are not
 
07:28:01.190 --> 07:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
inevitable far from it so in the context
 
07:28:04.968 --> 07:28:04.978 align:start position:0%
of non-emergency use vaccines even if
 
07:28:07.490 --> 07:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
parents are able to obtain money damages
 
07:28:10.368 --> 07:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
through litigation of some sort money
 
07:28:13.128 --> 07:28:13.138 align:start position:0%
cannot undo the types of injuries that
 
07:28:16.010 --> 07:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
I've just described and nobody wants to
 
07:28:17.570 --> 07:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
have to go through that
 
07:28:19.910 --> 07:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
but even the worse in the context of
 
07:28:22.788 --> 07:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
covid-19 injections and any other future
 
07:28:25.010 --> 07:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
injections that are qualified as
 
07:28:29.030 --> 07:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
emergency emergency use products the
 
07:28:31.850 --> 07:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
prep act the public Readiness
 
07:28:34.070 --> 07:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
um what is it the the public Readiness
 
07:28:38.230 --> 07:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
and emergency preparedness act
 
07:28:41.270 --> 07:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
precludes really any state law remedies
 
07:28:44.448 --> 07:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
for any kinds of of injuries so in the
 
07:28:47.090 --> 07:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
Vermont case and I have a copy of that
 
07:28:48.468 --> 07:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
here for the committee I just have one
 
07:28:50.448 --> 07:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
copy but I'm happy to email a link for
 
07:28:52.310 --> 07:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
people who want to read it in the
 
07:28:54.948 --> 07:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont case the court dismissed state
 
07:28:57.708 --> 07:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
law claims of battery negligent
 
07:29:00.830 --> 07:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
infliction of emotional distress fraud
 
07:29:02.990 --> 07:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
violations of the State Health Care Bill
 
07:29:05.208 --> 07:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
of Rights and other state law claims
 
07:29:06.548 --> 07:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
that were brought
 
07:29:09.590 --> 07:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the the Court held that the prep act
 
07:29:11.868 --> 07:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
precludes any state law remedies for
 
07:29:15.350 --> 07:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 injection errors according to
 
07:29:18.468 --> 07:29:18.478 align:start position:0%
the judge prep immunized all of the
 
07:29:20.810 --> 07:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
defendants against any state law claims
 
07:29:22.310 --> 07:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
of and this is the judge's word
 
07:29:25.730 --> 07:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
malfeasance so basically under under the
 
07:29:28.128 --> 07:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
prep act as interpreted by the Vermont
 
07:29:29.930 --> 07:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
court and other courts across the
 
07:29:32.690 --> 07:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
country basically
 
07:29:35.628 --> 07:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
um any school-based covid-19 injection
 
07:29:38.330 --> 07:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
Clinic is a zone of complete lawlessness
 
07:29:40.548 --> 07:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
there are just no remedies for mistakes
 
07:29:42.708 --> 07:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm seven I think your three
 
07:29:44.330 --> 07:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
minutes is up though thank you if you
 
07:29:46.128 --> 07:29:46.138 align:start position:0%

07:30:25.788 --> 07:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman committee members so I'm
 
07:30:29.750 --> 07:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
Aubry Friedman Bridgewater oh yeah no no
 
07:30:31.670 --> 07:30:31.680 align:start position:0%

Friedman uh Bridgewater private citizen
 
07:30:39.650 --> 07:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
I totally support this bill
 
07:30:41.390 --> 07:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
um all the most of the things I've
 
07:30:44.090 --> 07:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
already been mentioned the disruptions
 
07:30:46.850 --> 07:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
um the errors no liability apparently
 
07:30:50.270 --> 07:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
for these kinds of things going on is
 
07:30:52.250 --> 07:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
unbelievable I mean these things may be
 
07:30:54.110 --> 07:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
carried for the rest of the kids life
 
07:30:56.330 --> 07:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
but anyway I just have two things I
 
07:30:58.788 --> 07:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
could add to the conversation so I'm in
 
07:31:01.190 --> 07:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
sau4 and I go to the school board
 
07:31:04.610 --> 07:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
meetings and the topic of vaccine
 
07:31:06.468 --> 07:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
clinics came up a few months ago of
 
07:31:08.570 --> 07:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
course I was there uh speaking against
 
07:31:11.810 --> 07:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
them but what was interesting
 
07:31:13.850 --> 07:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the big discussion is should we have
 
07:31:16.610 --> 07:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
separate uh covet versus flu should we
 
07:31:18.650 --> 07:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
do it on the same days or different arms
 
07:31:20.750 --> 07:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
or all that kind of up of course they
 
07:31:23.990 --> 07:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
voted for the vaccine Clements but what
 
07:31:26.628 --> 07:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing was what was the
 
07:31:29.510 --> 07:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
reason that they ended up doing it we've
 
07:31:32.208 --> 07:31:32.218 align:start position:0%
been doing it for years now that's a
 
07:31:33.830 --> 07:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
really good reason for doing something
 
07:31:36.048 --> 07:31:36.058 align:start position:0%
just because you've always done it in
 
07:31:38.868 --> 07:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
the past let's not put any thought into
 
07:31:40.190 --> 07:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
maybe something should be done
 
07:31:42.410 --> 07:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
differently so we talk about local
 
07:31:45.410 --> 07:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
control believe me they can be
 
07:31:47.868 --> 07:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
tyrannical too so the other thing I
 
07:31:49.190 --> 07:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to just talk about for a second
 
07:31:54.230 --> 07:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
was convenience kids are inconvenient I
 
07:31:56.150 --> 07:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
raised a child I did it a single parent
 
07:31:59.090 --> 07:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
and I didn't you know you you took your
 
07:32:00.968 --> 07:32:00.978 align:start position:0%
kid to the doctor
 
07:32:03.288 --> 07:32:03.298 align:start position:0%
there are certain things you do as a
 
07:32:05.510 --> 07:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
parent that's your responsibility what
 
07:32:07.670 --> 07:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
kind of parent would just drop their
 
07:32:10.730 --> 07:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
kids off at a doctor to get shots
 
07:32:12.410 --> 07:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
because this is basically what people
 
07:32:15.048 --> 07:32:15.058 align:start position:0%
are wanting to do is just you know it's
 
07:32:15.058 --> 07:32:16.730 align:start position:0%
are wanting to do is just you know it's
convenient

07:32:16.730 --> 07:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
convenient
 
07:32:18.770 --> 07:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I mean even your dog you you take
 
07:32:20.628 --> 07:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
your dog to the vet that forever the
 
07:32:22.850 --> 07:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
shots you don't just drop them off so
 
07:32:25.910 --> 07:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
this whole point of convenience is to me
 
07:32:28.850 --> 07:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
disgusting I mean there's the pharmacies
 
07:32:31.490 --> 07:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
it can be done after school or any of
 
07:32:33.288 --> 07:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so this is really
 
07:32:36.288 --> 07:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
shirking parents responsibilities making
 
07:32:39.590 --> 07:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
excuses for it it's inexcusable so I
 
07:32:43.010 --> 07:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
support this bill let kid let schools be
 
07:32:45.468 --> 07:32:45.478 align:start position:0%
schools anymore they're not medical
 
07:32:47.690 --> 07:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
centers they're not hospitals and they
 
07:32:50.030 --> 07:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
weren't meant to be thank you
 
07:32:53.270 --> 07:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any question uh further
 
07:32:55.788 --> 07:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee scene none
 
07:32:57.368 --> 07:32:57.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
07:33:11.110 --> 07:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:14.628 --> 07:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
hello Kathy Holmes Chai Chester I bet
 
07:33:16.368 --> 07:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
I'll be the quickest one
 
07:33:19.690 --> 07:33:19.700 align:start position:0%
I just say Amen to what Jim colpalt said
 
07:33:24.190 --> 07:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
but the extra thing I want to put in is
 
07:33:27.110 --> 07:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know schools don't sing Christmas
 
07:33:29.330 --> 07:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
songs anymore because they're afraid of
 
07:33:31.030 --> 07:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
being sued
 
07:33:34.868 --> 07:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
and so what are you even talking about
 
07:33:39.350 --> 07:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
this uh liability I'm also speaking for
 
07:33:41.690 --> 07:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
the check that the taxpayers all over
 
07:33:44.750 --> 07:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state I do not want my town to be
 
07:33:48.230 --> 07:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
paying millions of dollars in lawsuits
 
07:33:51.230 --> 07:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
and you can protect every town
 
07:33:51.240 --> 07:33:53.208 align:start position:0%
and you can protect every town
okay

07:33:53.208 --> 07:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:33:55.128 --> 07:33:55.138 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you very much
 
07:33:57.530 --> 07:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
07:33:57.540 --> 07:34:02.750 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
Joseph

07:34:02.750 --> 07:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:02.760 --> 07:34:06.410 align:start position:0%
 
Keen

07:34:06.410 --> 07:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:06.420 --> 07:34:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
I

07:34:08.030 --> 07:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:34:10.128 --> 07:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
definitely on his left so uh how about
 
07:34:21.890 --> 07:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:24.650 --> 07:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
hello thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
07:34:26.208 --> 07:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee my name is
 
07:34:28.850 --> 07:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
Louise Spencer I'm from Concord New
 
07:34:30.590 --> 07:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm with the Kent Street
 
07:34:33.770 --> 07:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
Coalition on all volunteer Grassroots
 
07:34:36.948 --> 07:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization and I'm here to
 
07:34:40.610 --> 07:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to this bill
 
07:34:43.610 --> 07:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that this is
 
07:34:45.590 --> 07:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily prescriptive and
 
07:34:49.548 --> 07:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
restrictive and that we really need all
 
07:34:52.128 --> 07:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
our tools in the tool kit available to
 
07:34:55.910 --> 07:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
respond to evolving Public Health needs
 
07:34:55.920 --> 07:34:56.750 align:start position:0%
respond to evolving Public Health needs
um

07:34:56.750 --> 07:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:59.208 --> 07:34:59.218 align:start position:0%
we can have local school boards look at
 
07:35:00.770 --> 07:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
this and decide if they're going to do
 
07:35:03.890 --> 07:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
it in their communities at a given time
 
07:35:08.868 --> 07:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
but to put a blanket ban on it seems way
 
07:35:10.850 --> 07:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
too heavy-handed given the health issues
 
07:35:12.128 --> 07:35:12.138 align:start position:0%
we have
 
07:35:14.708 --> 07:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
arising over time
 
07:35:17.628 --> 07:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
the schools have a vested interest in
 
07:35:20.690 --> 07:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
this and that if if there are epidemics
 
07:35:25.430 --> 07:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
of flu or other illnesses you lose lots
 
07:35:25.440 --> 07:35:26.110 align:start position:0%
of flu or other illnesses you lose lots
of

07:35:26.110 --> 07:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:35:29.448 --> 07:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
school hours whether it's teachers or
 
07:35:32.330 --> 07:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
six students that is very disruptive to
 
07:35:35.448 --> 07:35:35.458 align:start position:0%
the school day and to school learning
 
07:35:38.150 --> 07:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
we do need checks and balances for sure
 
07:35:40.070 --> 07:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
and there should be legal remedies
 
07:35:43.190 --> 07:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
available when things go wrong and
 
07:35:46.670 --> 07:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
foreign consent is essential but perhaps
 
07:35:49.430 --> 07:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
we could give parents the opt out
 
07:35:51.948 --> 07:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
um you know advance notice this is going
 
07:35:55.548 --> 07:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
to be happening and that they can keep
 
07:35:58.670 --> 07:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
their kids home as an excused absence
 
07:36:01.610 --> 07:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
for that period of time there have a lot
 
07:36:04.610 --> 07:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
who've talked about convenience but
 
07:36:07.250 --> 07:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
um that's not really fair maybe for some
 
07:36:09.590 --> 07:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of convenience but there
 
07:36:11.750 --> 07:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
are many reasons that it may be
 
07:36:13.730 --> 07:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
difficult for a parent to get their
 
07:36:16.690 --> 07:36:16.700 align:start position:0%
child to the doctor
 
07:36:19.910 --> 07:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
disabled parents are one example that
 
07:36:23.690 --> 07:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
comes to mind so I hear the timer
 
07:36:26.390 --> 07:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
what's up thank you very much
 
07:36:28.610 --> 07:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
um representative Belcher
 
07:36:30.368 --> 07:36:30.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
07:36:33.890 --> 07:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
verify I'm not sure if you use the
 
07:36:35.448 --> 07:36:35.458 align:start position:0%
um the word you meant to say were you
 
07:36:38.750 --> 07:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we should perhaps go to
 
07:36:40.910 --> 07:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
um an opt out system instead of
 
07:36:40.920 --> 07:36:42.708 align:start position:0%
um an opt out system instead of
affirmative

07:36:42.708 --> 07:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
07:36:44.990 --> 07:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
um informed consent not for informed
 
07:36:46.670 --> 07:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
consent no of course it has to be
 
07:36:48.708 --> 07:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
written informed consent what I'm
 
07:36:50.990 --> 07:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting is if there's concern about
 
07:36:54.350 --> 07:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
having a child at school when there's a
 
07:36:56.628 --> 07:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinic that that would be a
 
07:36:58.250 --> 07:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
time a parent could say I'm going to
 
07:37:00.350 --> 07:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
keep my child home without penalty thank
 
07:37:01.670 --> 07:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
07:37:04.730 --> 07:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
you know informed consent is essential
 
07:37:06.948 --> 07:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:37:08.150 --> 07:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:37:17.628 --> 07:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:22.730 --> 07:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:24.590 --> 07:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
good evening now
 
07:37:26.270 --> 07:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Anne Murray Banfield I'm a
 
07:37:27.830 --> 07:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate focused on
 
07:37:30.590 --> 07:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and education for
 
07:37:32.810 --> 07:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
all children in New Hampshire
 
07:37:34.788 --> 07:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
as you have heard we have two incidents
 
07:37:36.110 --> 07:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
where children in Rochester and
 
07:37:37.430 --> 07:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
Nashville were given the flu shot
 
07:37:39.170 --> 07:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
against their parents wishes I was
 
07:37:41.030 --> 07:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
immediately contacted by the parent in
 
07:37:43.610 --> 07:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
Rochester after this happened
 
07:37:45.708 --> 07:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
in the case of the Rochester child she
 
07:37:47.930 --> 07:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
was a young child kindergarten
 
07:37:49.788 --> 07:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
and she was also sick at the time and
 
07:37:50.690 --> 07:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to get the flu
 
07:37:52.190 --> 07:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine when you're sick and guess what
 
07:37:54.110 --> 07:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
she got the flu vaccine even though her
 
07:37:57.788 --> 07:37:57.798 align:start position:0%
parents said no and was sick
 
07:38:00.170 --> 07:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
she even wrote on the page do not
 
07:38:01.850 --> 07:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
vaccinate my child
 
07:38:03.708 --> 07:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
so this bill is very simple it will
 
07:38:05.570 --> 07:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
eliminate the possibility of mistakes in
 
07:38:06.430 --> 07:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
the future
 
07:38:08.510 --> 07:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
offering these clinics during school
 
07:38:10.670 --> 07:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
hours caused these errors to occur the
 
07:38:12.048 --> 07:38:12.058 align:start position:0%
parents thought that they could trust
 
07:38:14.448 --> 07:38:14.458 align:start position:0%
that if they did not consent that that
 
07:38:16.910 --> 07:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be that that would be followed now
 
07:38:18.288 --> 07:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
parents are saying to keep their
 
07:38:19.968 --> 07:38:19.978 align:start position:0%
children home if they do not want their
 
07:38:22.430 --> 07:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
child vaccinated so they lose lose a day
 
07:38:25.190 --> 07:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
of Education in in the case in Vermont
 
07:38:26.628 --> 07:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
they pulled their kid out of the school
 
07:38:29.810 --> 07:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
this continues expect enrollments to
 
07:38:31.430 --> 07:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
continue to decline
 
07:38:33.530 --> 07:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
so another last day to receiving an
 
07:38:35.570 --> 07:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
education because this news has spreads
 
07:38:37.070 --> 07:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
appearance across the state so expect
 
07:38:41.208 --> 07:38:41.218 align:start position:0%
more to keep their their kids home
 
07:38:44.270 --> 07:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
um this is more added to the day and I
 
07:38:46.070 --> 07:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
think earlier testimony said that we're
 
07:38:49.310 --> 07:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
spreading these schools so thin that at
 
07:38:52.368 --> 07:38:52.378 align:start position:0%
what point do we go back to teaching and
 
07:38:52.378 --> 07:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
what point do we go back to teaching and
learning

07:38:53.510 --> 07:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
learning
 
07:38:55.730 --> 07:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I am not for and I am not against
 
07:38:59.150 --> 07:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines so the the implication that
 
07:39:02.750 --> 07:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
this is anti-vaccine is not true I'm for
 
07:39:04.910 --> 07:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
parents making this decision I'm for
 
07:39:07.010 --> 07:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
parents accompanying their children if
 
07:39:09.350 --> 07:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
they are to receive a vaccine these are
 
07:39:11.330 --> 07:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable requirements to expect from
 
07:39:13.368 --> 07:39:13.378 align:start position:0%
our local public schools and those
 
07:39:15.590 --> 07:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
administering vaccines they have an
 
07:39:17.510 --> 07:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide the service on
 
07:39:21.468 --> 07:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:23.270 --> 07:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you I normally don't talk
 
07:39:25.368 --> 07:39:25.378 align:start position:0%
about personal things but I can tell you
 
07:39:27.350 --> 07:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
if I was that child in Rochester I'd
 
07:39:29.750 --> 07:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been traumatized because I hated
 
07:39:31.610 --> 07:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
needles and I would have screamed and
 
07:39:33.468 --> 07:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
cried and everything else if I was that
 
07:39:36.110 --> 07:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
child I passed out in a dentist chair
 
07:39:38.570 --> 07:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
when they gave me novocaine I passed out
 
07:39:40.548 --> 07:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
when I was 12 years old getting my ears
 
07:39:41.990 --> 07:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
pierced in the mall
 
07:39:44.868 --> 07:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
I would have been traumatized I would
 
07:39:46.368 --> 07:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
never have wanted to go back to that
 
07:39:48.530 --> 07:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
school again if they would have given me
 
07:39:50.110 --> 07:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
a vaccine in school
 
07:39:52.548 --> 07:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
so I and I suspect that many children
 
07:39:54.650 --> 07:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
are like that probably not all I mean my
 
07:39:58.208 --> 07:39:58.218 align:start position:0%
kids have had vaccines in the past
 
07:40:00.770 --> 07:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh if the professionals test with this
 
07:40:02.270 --> 07:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
assignment cannot complete it without
 
07:40:05.750 --> 07:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
making mistakes then it needs to stop we
 
07:40:07.610 --> 07:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
have evidence that mistakes are going to
 
07:40:10.490 --> 07:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
happen let's put some parameters so
 
07:40:13.250 --> 07:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
those mistakes never happen again any
 
07:40:15.590 --> 07:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
child could get a vaccine in this state
 
07:40:20.090 --> 07:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
any child any day anywhere you go to CVS
 
07:40:22.850 --> 07:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
Rite Aid anywhere this is not
 
07:40:25.310 --> 07:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine and it's not a way to stop
 
07:40:25.320 --> 07:40:26.090 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine and it's not a way to stop
it

07:40:26.090 --> 07:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:40:28.968 --> 07:40:28.978 align:start position:0%
just asking for parameters thank you
 
07:40:31.010 --> 07:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Miss
 
07:40:31.020 --> 07:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Miss

Condon from Bedford I'm a volunteer New
 
07:41:07.250 --> 07:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire director of advocacy with the
 
07:41:09.890 --> 07:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
national vaccine information center and
 
07:41:11.448 --> 07:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of House
 
07:41:13.910 --> 07:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 539
 
07:41:16.490 --> 07:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
um May I remind you as others have said
 
07:41:18.948 --> 07:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
that vaccination is a medical procedure
 
07:41:21.948 --> 07:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
it is an elective medical procedure they
 
07:41:24.850 --> 07:41:24.860 align:start position:0%
are not candy vaccines carry risk
 
07:41:27.230 --> 07:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
schools are for educating not for
 
07:41:29.628 --> 07:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
performing medical procedures
 
07:41:31.368 --> 07:41:31.378 align:start position:0%
we should there was also a question
 
07:41:34.850 --> 07:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
about uh liability here and I would pose
 
07:41:36.650 --> 07:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
a question what is the liability of a
 
07:41:38.750 --> 07:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
school district for injury or death to a
 
07:41:40.850 --> 07:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
child the result of a school Clinic
 
07:41:43.310 --> 07:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
school districts have no immunity for
 
07:41:46.190 --> 07:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
protection of the 1986 National
 
07:41:49.310 --> 07:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine injury act for hosting
 
07:41:51.708 --> 07:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
these vaccine clinics the nurses that
 
07:41:53.208 --> 07:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
administer the vaccine have immunity
 
07:41:55.070 --> 07:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
from liability the manufacturers do the
 
07:41:56.990 --> 07:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
clinic themselves the school district
 
07:41:59.448 --> 07:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
does not they've got there's a ripe
 
07:42:02.208 --> 07:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for a lawsuit I know
 
07:42:03.830 --> 07:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
there was talk about the covered shot
 
07:42:06.128 --> 07:42:06.138 align:start position:0%
everyone has immunity from liability
 
07:42:08.570 --> 07:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
under the prep rack for the covert shots
 
07:42:10.310 --> 07:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
even volunteers which a school is
 
07:42:12.530 --> 07:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
they're they're volunteer hosts for
 
07:42:14.570 --> 07:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
these clinics but they are not immunity
 
07:42:17.628 --> 07:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
from liability for the flu shots which
 
07:42:20.090 --> 07:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
we've heard from DHHS and and those are
 
07:42:21.770 --> 07:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
the shots that are actually being given
 
07:42:24.110 --> 07:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
in fact I will share with you I have
 
07:42:27.708 --> 07:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
handouts here of two children who have
 
07:42:30.850 --> 07:42:30.860 align:start position:0%
died as a result of flu shots one was
 
07:42:34.010 --> 07:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old Kalyn Matton from Vermont
 
07:42:36.048 --> 07:42:36.058 align:start position:0%
and that's all she got was a flu shot
 
07:42:37.968 --> 07:42:37.978 align:start position:0%
and the other one was a two-year-old New
 
07:42:41.990 --> 07:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire girl who died in December here
 
07:42:44.030 --> 07:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and she had gotten a flu shot in a
 
07:42:46.128 --> 07:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
covered shot these were not school
 
07:42:47.628 --> 07:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
clinics but I just want to make you
 
07:42:50.930 --> 07:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
aware that the risk of death is there
 
07:42:54.288 --> 07:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
um schools are for teaching and um
 
07:42:56.750 --> 07:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of access these days
 
07:42:58.548 --> 07:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
um to vaccines it used to be that the
 
07:43:00.708 --> 07:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
school-based clinics were necessary but
 
07:43:02.150 --> 07:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was really become an Antiquated
 
07:43:05.510 --> 07:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
program because now parents have access
 
07:43:08.030 --> 07:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
to vaccines everywhere including Corner
 
07:43:09.830 --> 07:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
Drug service grocery stores doctors of
 
07:43:11.628 --> 07:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
all kinds hospitals urgent care
 
07:43:13.788 --> 07:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
facilities even Public Health offices
 
07:43:16.128 --> 07:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
and clinics there's simply no longer a
 
07:43:17.750 --> 07:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
need for schools to host vaccination
 
07:43:19.910 --> 07:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
clinics and schools during school hours
 
07:43:22.190 --> 07:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
and to track from the essential purpose
 
07:43:24.830 --> 07:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
of schools and that's to educate our
 
07:43:24.840 --> 07:43:26.330 align:start position:0%
of schools and that's to educate our
children

07:43:26.330 --> 07:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:43:26.340 --> 07:43:27.368 align:start position:0%
children
um

07:43:27.368 --> 07:43:27.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:29.570 --> 07:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
these days there's over 20 different
 
07:43:31.250 --> 07:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
vaccines that can be administered to
 
07:43:32.690 --> 07:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
Children although we've heard they're
 
07:43:35.510 --> 07:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're only doing the flu and then
 
07:43:37.310 --> 07:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
covered shots
 
07:43:38.810 --> 07:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
um let's say I'm going to skip through
 
07:43:40.250 --> 07:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
some notes here because I know my three
 
07:43:40.260 --> 07:43:41.448 align:start position:0%
some notes here because I know my three
minutes

07:43:41.448 --> 07:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
07:43:41.458 --> 07:43:44.930 align:start position:0%
minutes
um

07:43:44.930 --> 07:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:48.350 --> 07:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's um and I've had parents come to me
 
07:43:50.150 --> 07:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
who said um that they're they're
 
07:43:51.590 --> 07:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawing their children from the
 
07:43:53.628 --> 07:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
public school system one of the top
 
07:43:57.350 --> 07:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
concerns are these vaccine clinics
 
07:43:59.150 --> 07:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and they're looking to homeschool
 
07:44:00.530 --> 07:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
their to send their children to other
 
07:44:02.448 --> 07:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
schools I'd be happy to take any
 
07:44:03.890 --> 07:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sorry it sounds like my
 
07:44:08.448 --> 07:44:08.458 align:start position:0%

support HB 539 a bill that would
 
07:44:54.048 --> 07:44:54.058 align:start position:0%
prohibit conducting vaccination clinics
 
07:44:56.208 --> 07:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
during school hours my seven-year-old
 
07:44:57.770 --> 07:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
daughter was given the flu vaccine
 
07:44:59.570 --> 07:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
without my consent at her Nashua
 
07:45:01.490 --> 07:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
Elementary School one of these mobile
 
07:45:03.590 --> 07:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics my seven-year-old
 
07:45:05.390 --> 07:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
daughter was traumatized she was brought
 
07:45:07.490 --> 07:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
into a room her arm was held down she
 
07:45:09.048 --> 07:45:09.058 align:start position:0%
cried she screamed and she was
 
07:45:10.850 --> 07:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
administered a dose of the flu vaccine
 
07:45:12.110 --> 07:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
through a needle that was never
 
07:45:13.910 --> 07:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
consented to
 
07:45:15.890 --> 07:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
she came home that day presented me with
 
07:45:18.708 --> 07:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
the Nashua DHHS vaccine card she did the
 
07:45:20.330 --> 07:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
best job a seven-year-old could in
 
07:45:21.708 --> 07:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
explaining all that happened that
 
07:45:23.990 --> 07:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
morning I checked her bag there was no
 
07:45:26.090 --> 07:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
fact sheet and no adverse reaction sheet
 
07:45:28.368 --> 07:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
sent with this vaccination card I
 
07:45:30.230 --> 07:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
comforted her as best I could and in my
 
07:45:32.150 --> 07:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
panic I reviewed all my paperwork and
 
07:45:33.830 --> 07:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
emails to see if I could have possibly
 
07:45:36.830 --> 07:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
or accidentally consented to this in my
 
07:45:38.810 --> 07:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
review of my emails and my papers I did
 
07:45:40.788 --> 07:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
not sign the vaccine consent form so
 
07:45:42.350 --> 07:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
this had been the worst kind of error
 
07:45:44.690 --> 07:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
not only did I not understand how this
 
07:45:46.310 --> 07:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
could have possibly happened but my
 
07:45:48.048 --> 07:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
daughter did not understand how I could
 
07:45:50.570 --> 07:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
have allowed this why I would do this to
 
07:45:53.270 --> 07:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
her without giving her a heads up and
 
07:45:55.128 --> 07:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
why I wasn't there to go through this
 
07:45:56.750 --> 07:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
scary moment with her
 
07:45:59.150 --> 07:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
no mother should have to care for this
 
07:46:01.788 --> 07:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
avoidable incident after the fact
 
07:46:03.468 --> 07:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
since this has happened my daughter has
 
07:46:05.510 --> 07:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
been fearful to be called anywhere in
 
07:46:07.850 --> 07:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
the school the intercom announcements
 
07:46:09.948 --> 07:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
give her anxiety and she has been sick
 
07:46:11.810 --> 07:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
off and on since receiving the flu shot
 
07:46:14.090 --> 07:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
I am unsure since she'd never received
 
07:46:16.070 --> 07:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
this vaccine prior to this incident at
 
07:46:17.750 --> 07:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
school if the two could potentially be
 
07:46:17.760 --> 07:46:18.770 align:start position:0%
school if the two could potentially be
related

07:46:18.770 --> 07:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
related
 
07:46:20.628 --> 07:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
I did not know how to address this
 
07:46:22.670 --> 07:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
atrocity and I'm thankful for my friend
 
07:46:24.708 --> 07:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
and lifelong National resident Allison
 
07:46:26.868 --> 07:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
dyer for aiding me and bringing this to
 
07:46:29.150 --> 07:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
light had she not alerted everyone from
 
07:46:30.890 --> 07:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
the school to the state I do not believe
 
07:46:32.330 --> 07:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
they would have taken this issue
 
07:46:35.390 --> 07:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
seriously I fall into a category the
 
07:46:37.128 --> 07:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill claim to care
 
07:46:39.890 --> 07:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
about I am a single Latina mother who
 
07:46:41.750 --> 07:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
has struggled to provide all I can for
 
07:46:43.610 --> 07:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
my daughter since the death of her
 
07:46:46.610 --> 07:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
father but I am not incapable of making
 
07:46:49.310 --> 07:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
appointments for my own child whether
 
07:46:50.868 --> 07:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
that be at a pharmacy or at her
 
07:46:52.730 --> 07:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office for regular well
 
07:46:55.490 --> 07:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
visits or necessary vaccinations
 
07:46:57.590 --> 07:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
but when this issue was brought to the
 
07:46:59.628 --> 07:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
attention of the national DHHS they
 
07:47:01.610 --> 07:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
refused to answer my friend Allison and
 
07:47:04.490 --> 07:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
contact for my contact information she's
 
07:47:06.708 --> 07:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
a polarized figure in my community due
 
07:47:09.170 --> 07:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
to her outspoken and advocacy for the
 
07:47:10.868 --> 07:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
children of my city
 
07:47:13.910 --> 07:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
to quote directly from the DHHS director
 
07:47:16.368 --> 07:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
I will not respond to miss Dyer because
 
07:47:18.170 --> 07:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
my friend Allison had emailed on my
 
07:47:20.030 --> 07:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
behalf about this incident and I had
 
07:47:21.530 --> 07:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
asked that anyone wanting to speak with
 
07:47:24.048 --> 07:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
me directly about my daughter respond to
 
07:47:25.490 --> 07:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
Allison and she would provide that
 
07:47:27.410 --> 07:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
information this is not how public
 
07:47:30.048 --> 07:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
appointed and taxpayer paid and funded
 
07:47:31.730 --> 07:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
entities should deal with our children
 
07:47:33.890 --> 07:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
and families I've seen what's happened
 
07:47:36.048 --> 07:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
to persons who speak out in Nashua this
 
07:47:37.548 --> 07:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
should have never happened and we need
 
07:47:39.468 --> 07:47:39.478 align:start position:0%
to make sure like something something
 
07:47:44.468 --> 07:47:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:47.690 --> 07:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh
 
07:47:52.368 --> 07:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
uh either uh Miss Perez or Miss Dyer
 
07:47:53.810 --> 07:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
um see none thank you very much and if
 
07:47:55.670 --> 07:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
you could leave both testimonies that
 
07:47:56.868 --> 07:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
would be great you can just leave them
 
07:47:58.750 --> 07:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
up front
 
07:48:02.150 --> 07:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
Therese Grinnell I think she left
 
07:48:02.160 --> 07:48:03.410 align:start position:0%
Therese Grinnell I think she left
yep

07:48:03.410 --> 07:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
yep
 
07:48:16.730 --> 07:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:19.548 --> 07:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um and thank you all
 
07:48:21.410 --> 07:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
for staying so late I will try and keep
 
07:48:24.530 --> 07:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
my comments brief and um not repeat
 
07:48:27.708 --> 07:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
things my name is Heather Raymond I am a
 
07:48:29.690 --> 07:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
state representative who represents
 
07:48:32.868 --> 07:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District Five uh Nashua and in
 
07:48:32.878 --> 07:48:33.770 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District Five uh Nashua and in
fact

07:48:33.770 --> 07:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
fact
 
07:48:35.810 --> 07:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
um The District in which
 
07:48:38.690 --> 07:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
um this incident occurred that we just
 
07:48:40.190 --> 07:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
07:48:42.530 --> 07:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I like I said I don't want to repeat
 
07:48:46.510 --> 07:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
anything I'm here to oppose this bill
 
07:48:49.430 --> 07:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
Nashua as many of you know is the second
 
07:48:52.090 --> 07:48:52.100 align:start position:0%
largest school district in New Hampshire
 
07:48:55.190 --> 07:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
the public health office administers
 
07:48:57.590 --> 07:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
over a thousand vaccines each year and
 
07:49:00.708 --> 07:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
has done so for about 12 years in our 18
 
07:49:04.430 --> 07:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
schools in that time there was one
 
07:49:08.388 --> 07:49:08.398 align:start position:0%
circumstance this year where a form was
 
07:49:10.868 --> 07:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
returned to the school
 
07:49:14.750 --> 07:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the person who provided the vaccine
 
07:49:17.090 --> 07:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
didn't carefully check it over to to
 
07:49:18.770 --> 07:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
make sure that it wasn't just completed
 
07:49:20.930 --> 07:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
but also signed and then they
 
07:49:22.850 --> 07:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
administered the vaccine the school
 
07:49:25.070 --> 07:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
board took this very seriously I can
 
07:49:26.750 --> 07:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
attest to that being a member of the
 
07:49:29.750 --> 07:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
school board in a prior chair of the
 
07:49:32.150 --> 07:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
school board down in Nashua we requested
 
07:49:33.708 --> 07:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
that both public health and the
 
07:49:35.868 --> 07:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent investigate the situation
 
07:49:37.910 --> 07:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and come up with a plan to make sure
 
07:49:39.530 --> 07:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't happen again because we
 
07:49:41.090 --> 07:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
felt that this was completely
 
07:49:44.570 --> 07:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
unacceptable about 10 percent of our
 
07:49:47.270 --> 07:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
students get vaccines every year and one
 
07:49:49.430 --> 07:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting one without permission was not
 
07:49:52.610 --> 07:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay it was not okay with anybody since
 
07:49:54.770 --> 07:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
then Public Health has reviewed their
 
07:49:56.810 --> 07:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
process they have offered additional
 
07:49:59.750 --> 07:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
training to their staff and they have
 
07:50:02.330 --> 07:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
revised it such that each staff member
 
07:50:05.270 --> 07:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
giving a vaccine must look for the
 
07:50:07.430 --> 07:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
signature not just glance to make sure
 
07:50:09.468 --> 07:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
the rest of the form has been filled out
 
07:50:11.650 --> 07:50:11.660 align:start position:0%
and check off that they have in fact
 
07:50:14.448 --> 07:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
seen that signature before they are able
 
07:50:17.110 --> 07:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
to administer any vaccines so
 
07:50:20.388 --> 07:50:20.398 align:start position:0%
just as far as other information that I
 
07:50:22.128 --> 07:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
think is helpful for the committee to
 
07:50:25.548 --> 07:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
know regarding Nashua and vaccines in
 
07:50:28.070 --> 07:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
general Nash was only done the flu
 
07:50:30.708 --> 07:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine we don't do covert vaccines in
 
07:50:32.448 --> 07:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
school that wasn't something that we
 
07:50:34.750 --> 07:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
were interested in doing
 
07:50:37.548 --> 07:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine according to the CDC is
 
07:50:39.948 --> 07:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
40 to 60 percent effective each year
 
07:50:41.868 --> 07:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
some years it's a little bit more some
 
07:50:43.128 --> 07:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
years it's a little bit less this
 
07:50:45.650 --> 07:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
happens to be a high year
 
07:50:49.190 --> 07:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
um 45 of the parents in or the students
 
07:50:52.490 --> 07:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
in Nashua of our 10 000 students qualify
 
07:50:54.650 --> 07:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch this means
 
07:50:56.990 --> 07:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
that their family lives at or below the
 
07:50:58.910 --> 07:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level some of the
 
07:51:02.150 --> 07:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
consequences of being at or below the
 
07:51:04.190 --> 07:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level is that you don't
 
07:51:06.650 --> 07:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
have access to some of the things that I
 
07:51:08.990 --> 07:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
think people take for granted in this
 
07:51:12.230 --> 07:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
state we have a number of schools where
 
07:51:14.270 --> 07:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
students walk to school there isn't
 
07:51:15.230 --> 07:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation because there are
 
07:51:16.730 --> 07:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
Community Schools but we also have a
 
07:51:18.288 --> 07:51:18.298 align:start position:0%
number of families that don't have
 
07:51:20.810 --> 07:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
transportation so to say that we can do
 
07:51:22.850 --> 07:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
clinics outside of school hours without
 
07:51:25.490 --> 07:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
having an impact on our community is not
 
07:51:28.190 --> 07:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative of the reality in Nashua
 
07:51:29.990 --> 07:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
07:51:31.788 --> 07:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
07:51:33.110 --> 07:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:51:35.750 --> 07:51:35.760 align:start position:0%

07:51:47.330 --> 07:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is Betsy

Hampshire
 
07:51:52.548 --> 07:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
if children receive vaccines they should
 
07:51:54.468 --> 07:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
be doing it with a doctor or minimally
 
07:51:56.810 --> 07:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
with a parent present having a vaccine
 
07:51:58.610 --> 07:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
performed during school hours then
 
07:52:00.288 --> 07:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
sending the child back to class is
 
07:52:02.090 --> 07:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and probably pretty scary
 
07:52:04.430 --> 07:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
for a child especially if the child is
 
07:52:05.990 --> 07:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
having a reaction that they are too
 
07:52:07.368 --> 07:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to share
 
07:52:09.468 --> 07:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
it could become traumatizing to everyone
 
07:52:11.388 --> 07:52:11.398 align:start position:0%
to see and experience
 
07:52:13.850 --> 07:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions aren't that rare
 
07:52:16.730 --> 07:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
anymore my own child had one when he was
 
07:52:16.740 --> 07:52:17.810 align:start position:0%
anymore my own child had one when he was
three

07:52:17.810 --> 07:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
three
 
07:52:19.548 --> 07:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
he's 14 now
 
07:52:21.830 --> 07:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad I was there I keep my
 
07:52:23.448 --> 07:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
children home on vaccination days
 
07:52:25.368 --> 07:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
they've each missed two days of school
 
07:52:28.910 --> 07:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
this year to avoid any issues a large
 
07:52:31.190 --> 07:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
number of parents did as I did and they
 
07:52:32.810 --> 07:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
kept their kids home too
 
07:52:34.610 --> 07:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
clinics should not create a situation
 
07:52:36.170 --> 07:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
where students are missing days of
 
07:52:37.730 --> 07:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
school in response
 
07:52:40.070 --> 07:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
the current covid vaccines have warnings
 
07:52:41.510 --> 07:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
now regarding young men and heart
 
07:52:43.430 --> 07:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
related injuries that's part of our
 
07:52:45.230 --> 07:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
student population we shouldn't
 
07:52:46.730 --> 07:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
participate due to possible medical
 
07:52:49.070 --> 07:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
emergencies schools are not equipped to
 
07:52:50.690 --> 07:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
treat the reaction and we can't afford
 
07:52:53.868 --> 07:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
to be liable kids should be with parents
 
07:52:55.548 --> 07:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
when they decide a vaccine is right for
 
07:52:57.468 --> 07:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
their child schools are not medical
 
07:52:59.690 --> 07:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
clinics and shouldn't be we don't do a
 
07:53:04.670 --> 07:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
good job my district SAU 34 has given a
 
07:53:07.490 --> 07:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
flu shot to a child in error I know you
 
07:53:09.350 --> 07:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
guys have never heard of it but I have
 
07:53:12.110 --> 07:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
us moms talked a lot about it happened
 
07:53:15.110 --> 07:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
about two years ago this past year there
 
07:53:17.690 --> 07:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
was a child given a covid test because
 
07:53:21.048 --> 07:53:21.058 align:start position:0%
they did like group testing and that
 
07:53:22.850 --> 07:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
child was not supposed to be tested and
 
07:53:24.830 --> 07:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
was tested against their will even after
 
07:53:26.750 --> 07:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
they said they weren't supposed to be
 
07:53:28.430 --> 07:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
tested and they were told no your mom
 
07:53:30.888 --> 07:53:30.898 align:start position:0%
said so wasn't true
 
07:53:33.048 --> 07:53:33.058 align:start position:0%
so there are legitimate mistakes
 
07:53:35.868 --> 07:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
happening in SAU 34
 
07:53:38.810 --> 07:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
cobit vaccines have been given twice at
 
07:53:42.650 --> 07:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
SAU 34. I felt so strongly I stood on
 
07:53:44.510 --> 07:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
the corner with a sign and that's the
 
07:53:46.190 --> 07:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
first time I'd ever protested anything
 
07:53:48.048 --> 07:53:48.058 align:start position:0%
or even started to come to these kinds
 
07:53:50.270 --> 07:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
of things you know to speak that was the
 
07:53:52.190 --> 07:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
beginning for me because I just felt so
 
07:53:54.530 --> 07:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
strongly that I just didn't want any
 
07:53:56.570 --> 07:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
other moms to make the mistake and of
 
07:53:58.548 --> 07:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
course I got a few fingers as parents
 
07:54:00.048 --> 07:54:00.058 align:start position:0%
were driving into the school I stood
 
07:54:02.810 --> 07:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
right at the entrance and uh but most of
 
07:54:05.628 --> 07:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
them even the bus drivers gave me thumbs
 
07:54:08.208 --> 07:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
up and said that they agreed so I was
 
07:54:09.708 --> 07:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
actually surprised at the support I
 
07:54:11.270 --> 07:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
received even though I did stand there
 
07:54:13.850 --> 07:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
alone on that corner uh the day before
 
07:54:16.368 --> 07:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
in the morning of the vaccination clinic
 
07:54:17.690 --> 07:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
07:54:19.548 --> 07:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to end this by remembering
 
07:54:23.048 --> 07:54:23.058 align:start position:0%
officer Rory Bohannon he was SAU 34
 
07:54:25.548 --> 07:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
resource officer who died suddenly and
 
07:54:27.830 --> 07:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly at the lunchroom door at
 
07:54:30.230 --> 07:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
school my own reality has compelled me
 
07:54:31.610 --> 07:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
to come and beg for this potentially
 
07:54:33.650 --> 07:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
deadly practice of school-based vaccine
 
07:54:35.150 --> 07:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
clinics to end
 
07:54:39.410 --> 07:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:44.868 --> 07:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:49.010 --> 07:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:51.948 --> 07:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
no questions from the committee
 
07:55:06.850 --> 07:55:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:09.888 --> 07:55:09.898 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon thank you
 
07:55:11.448 --> 07:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
for having me
 
07:55:14.030 --> 07:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Larissa Traxler of Stoddard New
 
07:55:16.730 --> 07:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here in support of
 
07:55:19.070 --> 07:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 539
 
07:55:21.650 --> 07:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
as a registered nurse I take as a
 
07:55:23.990 --> 07:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
registered nurse since 1995 I should say
 
07:55:26.090 --> 07:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
I take great issue with the lack of
 
07:55:28.128 --> 07:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
safety in these vaccination clinics in
 
07:55:29.510 --> 07:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the school setting
 
07:55:32.388 --> 07:55:32.398 align:start position:0%
proper medical safety procedures proper
 
07:55:35.270 --> 07:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
identification and informed consent are
 
07:55:38.030 --> 07:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
severely compromised I have reviewed
 
07:55:39.530 --> 07:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
several of the New Hampshire incidents
 
07:55:42.530 --> 07:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
within the last year in which safety
 
07:55:44.868 --> 07:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
procedures and protocols were not being
 
07:55:44.878 --> 07:55:46.490 align:start position:0%
procedures and protocols were not being
followed

07:55:46.490 --> 07:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
followed
 
07:55:48.830 --> 07:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
as a pediatric nurse I have also been
 
07:55:51.230 --> 07:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
present for adverse reactions that would
 
07:55:53.330 --> 07:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
be quite challenging to manage in a
 
07:55:56.270 --> 07:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:59.208 --> 07:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
as a mom
 
07:56:01.788 --> 07:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
these vaccination clinics in school this
 
07:56:03.770 --> 07:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
is one of the many factors why I cannot
 
07:56:06.170 --> 07:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
send my children to public school
 
07:56:08.750 --> 07:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
two of my children at the time were age
 
07:56:12.170 --> 07:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
6 and 14 were put in a line for
 
07:56:14.628 --> 07:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination in school despite a very
 
07:56:16.670 --> 07:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
clear declination
 
07:56:18.530 --> 07:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
we handle matters of this nature with
 
07:56:20.448 --> 07:56:20.458 align:start position:0%
our trusted providers
 
07:56:22.368 --> 07:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
not at school
 
07:56:24.968 --> 07:56:24.978 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics are inherently not
 
07:56:28.610 --> 07:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
foolproof and have no place in the
 
07:56:30.530 --> 07:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
07:56:33.288 --> 07:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
children are there to learn
 
07:56:35.510 --> 07:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
I just ask that you please support House
 
07:56:38.030 --> 07:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 539 ought to pass
 
07:56:40.730 --> 07:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
and I'd rather not take questions thank
 
07:56:40.740 --> 07:56:42.650 align:start position:0%
and I'd rather not take questions thank
you

07:56:42.650 --> 07:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:56:51.350 --> 07:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:53.510 --> 07:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for being here
 
07:56:53.520 --> 07:56:54.410 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for being here
today

07:56:54.410 --> 07:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:56:54.420 --> 07:56:55.070 align:start position:0%
today
um

07:56:55.070 --> 07:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:56.930 --> 07:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
so much of what I wrote has already been
 
07:57:00.650 --> 07:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
stated but I did want to you know just
 
07:57:04.490 --> 07:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
reiterate liability liability liability
 
07:57:08.150 --> 07:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and vaccine injury is real it doesn't
 
07:57:10.070 --> 07:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
always happen with seizures or something
 
07:57:11.930 --> 07:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's immediate there's other things
 
07:57:14.868 --> 07:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
excuse me like lupus that can come weeks
 
07:57:17.628 --> 07:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
later or months later we have to be very
 
07:57:20.388 --> 07:57:20.398 align:start position:0%
cautious when we're injecting things
 
07:57:24.048 --> 07:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
into our children or ourselves and
 
07:57:28.270 --> 07:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to hb505 and this one
 
07:57:30.708 --> 07:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
why do we need
 
07:57:33.468 --> 07:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
schools to be medical facilities let's
 
07:57:36.590 --> 07:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
let them be schools we really do need to
 
07:57:38.990 --> 07:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
ensure the separation of um
 
07:57:42.110 --> 07:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
medicine in school and education
 
07:57:42.120 --> 07:57:42.948 align:start position:0%
medicine in school and education
um

07:57:42.948 --> 07:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:57:44.868 --> 07:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
I guess that's it
 
07:57:46.190 --> 07:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm from Peterborough I don't know if
 
07:57:47.830 --> 07:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
I said that part yes you did thank you
 
07:57:50.510 --> 07:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions thank you
 
07:57:52.490 --> 07:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
07:57:57.368 --> 07:57:57.378 align:start position:0%

um I am a supporter of
 
07:58:14.810 --> 07:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
hb359 I am not anti-vaxx I've been
 
07:58:16.788 --> 07:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
vaccinated my children have been
 
07:58:20.270 --> 07:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated my grandchildren vaccinated
 
07:58:22.310 --> 07:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
not at schools
 
07:58:25.730 --> 07:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:27.948 --> 07:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
I know you guys must be overwhelmed
 
07:58:29.510 --> 07:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing the tens of thousands of
 
07:58:32.270 --> 07:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
children's but parents might have three
 
07:58:35.570 --> 07:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
or four children to them that to those
 
07:58:37.850 --> 07:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
parents those children are more precious
 
07:58:39.650 --> 07:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
than you can imagine although on some of
 
07:58:42.410 --> 07:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
your parents I'm sure what is more
 
07:58:44.810 --> 07:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
precious to which apparent than his
 
07:58:44.820 --> 07:58:45.650 align:start position:0%
precious to which apparent than his
child

07:58:45.650 --> 07:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
child
 
07:58:48.590 --> 07:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
and can you imagine sending your child
 
07:58:50.270 --> 07:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
to school thinking You've Done Right
 
07:58:53.810 --> 07:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
Said No No vaccine uh she can't get the
 
07:58:55.670 --> 07:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
flu shot the doctors told me she can't
 
07:58:58.310 --> 07:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then find out that it has happened
 
07:59:01.010 --> 07:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
would it make you feel any better
 
07:59:03.888 --> 07:59:03.898 align:start position:0%
have to listen to some of the people say
 
07:59:05.930 --> 07:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
well we're trying to do better we're
 
07:59:08.570 --> 07:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
going to improve does it really make any
 
07:59:11.090 --> 07:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
of you feel any better hearing a
 
07:59:12.530 --> 07:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat say they're going to do
 
07:59:14.448 --> 07:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
better and we hope it doesn't happen
 
07:59:16.670 --> 07:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
again it only happened because they
 
07:59:18.708 --> 07:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
happen to have the same first name maybe
 
07:59:21.048 --> 07:59:21.058 align:start position:0%
so I can understand
 
07:59:23.170 --> 07:59:23.180 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that
 
07:59:26.510 --> 07:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
parents parents not I don't want to say
 
07:59:29.330 --> 07:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
they own the children but they are so
 
07:59:32.388 --> 07:59:32.398 align:start position:0%
attached their whole life our whole life
 
07:59:34.730 --> 07:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
were attached to our children
 
07:59:37.368 --> 07:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
so parents have the Supreme
 
07:59:39.948 --> 07:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
the Supreme rule of what happens to
 
07:59:42.170 --> 07:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
their children and no parent should have
 
07:59:44.930 --> 07:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
to wonder what's the school going to do
 
07:59:48.530 --> 07:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
to my kid today ever
 
07:59:50.690 --> 07:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
and probably the most egregious reason
 
07:59:53.868 --> 07:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
I've heard to put children through this
 
07:59:57.230 --> 07:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
is so that some bureaucrat can check off
 
08:00:00.048 --> 08:00:00.058 align:start position:0%
a box on the on the federal preparedness
 
08:00:02.868 --> 08:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
form come on I want you to ask the
 
08:00:06.048 --> 08:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
people and who in Louisiana what they
 
08:00:07.968 --> 08:00:07.978 align:start position:0%
think about federal health and federal
 
08:00:10.430 --> 08:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats checking off forms and
 
08:00:11.750 --> 08:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
helping them
 
08:00:14.510 --> 08:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
give this back to the parents it's not
 
08:00:16.430 --> 08:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
going it might be inconvenient to people
 
08:00:19.310 --> 08:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
but you just think about it come on they
 
08:00:22.128 --> 08:00:22.138 align:start position:0%
can't do it every Rite Aid every CVS
 
08:00:24.410 --> 08:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
every Pharmacy
 
08:00:27.490 --> 08:00:27.500 align:start position:0%
gives out free vaccines
 
08:00:30.230 --> 08:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
schools don't need to do it thank you
 
08:00:31.190 --> 08:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
very much
 
08:00:33.888 --> 08:00:33.898 align:start position:0%
thank you very much with that I don't
 
08:00:36.650 --> 08:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
have any other uh cards up here to speak
 
08:00:38.530 --> 08:00:38.540 align:start position:0%
on yes
 
08:00:42.468 --> 08:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
oh okay I wasn't here for the book come
 
08:00:43.490 --> 08:00:43.500 align:start position:0%

08:00:43.500 --> 08:00:50.170 align:start position:0%
on up

08:00:50.170 --> 08:00:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:53.330 --> 08:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing time Mr chair the
 
08:00:55.490 --> 08:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee thank you so much
 
08:00:57.350 --> 08:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to also thank representative
 
08:01:00.048 --> 08:01:00.058 align:start position:0%
Koval for bringing forth this a very
 
08:01:03.468 --> 08:01:03.478 align:start position:0%
important legislation
 
08:01:05.208 --> 08:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
um I think it needs to be a New
 
08:01:07.968 --> 08:01:07.978 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law or statute because I don't
 
08:01:09.888 --> 08:01:09.898 align:start position:0%
want to leave decisions like vaccination
 
08:01:12.110 --> 08:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
to my local school board I don't want
 
08:01:13.430 --> 08:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
that can you please introduce your name
 
08:01:16.070 --> 08:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
please I'm sorry Gary York I'm sorry I'm
 
08:01:18.530 --> 08:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
MD Hopkinton New Hampshire okay yep
 
08:01:21.048 --> 08:01:21.058 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:01:23.690 --> 08:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
um again uh you you've heard repetitive
 
08:01:27.410 --> 08:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
testimony throughout the day and
 
08:01:30.170 --> 08:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
this bill is about the value of informed
 
08:01:33.110 --> 08:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
consent and obtaining that consent not
 
08:01:35.150 --> 08:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
from children but from parents where it
 
08:01:38.150 --> 08:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
belongs by proxy this is their duty this
 
08:01:40.548 --> 08:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
is a parental rights Bill and in many
 
08:01:40.558 --> 08:01:42.170 align:start position:0%
is a parental rights Bill and in many
respects

08:01:42.170 --> 08:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
respects
 
08:01:44.990 --> 08:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's also a medical Freedom bill for
 
08:01:49.070 --> 08:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
keeping children and away from being
 
08:01:51.948 --> 08:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinated again through a parental
 
08:01:54.610 --> 08:01:54.620 align:start position:0%
decision which is what we all want to
 
08:01:59.150 --> 08:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
keep and hold dear in our hearts
 
08:02:01.788 --> 08:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
um and then uh someone uh many have
 
08:02:04.610 --> 08:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
spoke again about the separation of
 
08:02:07.310 --> 08:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
medicine versus education I think that's
 
08:02:10.010 --> 08:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
very important this is a medical issue
 
08:02:12.230 --> 08:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is keep the education to the school
 
08:02:14.690 --> 08:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
keep the medical information and
 
08:02:20.410 --> 08:02:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:24.048 --> 08:02:24.058 align:start position:0%
that's not a good deal of my career as a
 
08:02:26.570 --> 08:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
medical director and a laboratory in a
 
08:02:29.510 --> 08:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital where there is a
 
08:02:34.788 --> 08:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
hourly daily round-the-clock 365 days of
 
08:02:38.410 --> 08:02:38.420 align:start position:0%
the year attention to Quality Control
 
08:02:41.810 --> 08:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
quality assurance
 
08:02:44.990 --> 08:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
quality improvement that was our job
 
08:02:47.388 --> 08:02:47.398 align:start position:0%
and I was responsible for anything that
 
08:02:49.490 --> 08:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
went wrong in the in the laboratory
 
08:02:51.708 --> 08:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
setting so
 
08:02:54.888 --> 08:02:54.898 align:start position:0%
um we've heard about these never events
 
08:02:57.410 --> 08:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh this won't happen again
 
08:02:59.388 --> 08:02:59.398 align:start position:0%
uh in the hospital setting they were
 
08:03:01.628 --> 08:03:01.638 align:start position:0%
sugar coated and called a medical
 
08:03:04.788 --> 08:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
Misadventures how do you like that
 
08:03:04.798 --> 08:03:06.888 align:start position:0%
Misadventures how do you like that
yeah

08:03:06.888 --> 08:03:06.898 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
08:03:09.530 --> 08:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
some of these Misadventures are way out
 
08:03:11.330 --> 08:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
of whack
 
08:03:15.230 --> 08:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
my concern is uh the concept of a
 
08:03:18.430 --> 08:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine van coming to a school system
 
08:03:21.770 --> 08:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
and what what is the quality control who
 
08:03:26.150 --> 08:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
is giving vaccines who is identifying
 
08:03:27.368 --> 08:03:27.378 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
08:03:29.868 --> 08:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a six-year-old or an
 
08:03:31.430 --> 08:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old how do you get patient
 
08:03:33.708 --> 08:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
identification verified they don't have
 
08:03:35.510 --> 08:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
a wallet or an ID card or anything
 
08:03:39.230 --> 08:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
they've got a slip that maybe has their
 
08:03:42.468 --> 08:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
parents signature on it but my real
 
08:03:45.170 --> 08:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
concern is like who is in who are what
 
08:03:47.150 --> 08:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
are the what are the things that can go
 
08:03:49.610 --> 08:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
wrong in a scenario where you've got a
 
08:03:53.690 --> 08:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
mobile vaccine clinic fan circulating
 
08:03:56.510 --> 08:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions any questions
 
08:03:58.968 --> 08:03:58.978 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
08:04:02.330 --> 08:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
08:04:08.288 --> 08:04:08.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:10.490 --> 08:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
for the committee what we're going to do
 
08:04:13.430 --> 08:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
is just go the last two bills opening up
 
08:04:16.670 --> 08:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
recess open the other recess and then
 
08:04:18.650 --> 08:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
with that when we'll get a time to be
 
08:04:20.868 --> 08:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
announced most likely these bills will
 
08:04:22.670 --> 08:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
be carried over for
 
08:04:24.948 --> 08:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
um the 13th and I'll explain what we're
 
08:04:27.368 --> 08:04:27.378 align:start position:0%
going to be doing then
 
08:04:27.378 --> 08:04:28.910 align:start position:0%
going to be doing then
so

08:04:28.910 --> 08:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:04:28.920 --> 08:04:31.788 align:start position:0%
so
um

08:04:31.788 --> 08:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:35.110 --> 08:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh we need a rep just to go forward and
 
08:04:38.270 --> 08:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend
 
08:04:41.690 --> 08:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
tell me yes one of these bills I'm
 
08:04:43.010 --> 08:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart one of these
 
08:04:44.810 --> 08:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
bills is actually mine yeah it was my
 
08:04:46.788 --> 08:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
intention just to have this bill go away
 
08:04:48.410 --> 08:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
so if we wanted to introduce it don't
 
08:04:50.570 --> 08:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
take any questions we're gone
 
08:04:51.948 --> 08:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
well what we're going to do is we're
 
08:04:53.690 --> 08:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
just going to introduce it and if you
 
08:04:55.490 --> 08:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
just introduce it we can continue the
 
08:04:56.868 --> 08:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
hearing at a time to be announced but
 
08:04:59.750 --> 08:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
most likely on February the 13th
 
08:05:01.670 --> 08:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
08:05:03.230 --> 08:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
um if there's anybody who wants to
 
08:05:04.730 --> 08:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
testify another because I did announce
 
08:05:06.888 --> 08:05:06.898 align:start position:0%
earlier today that we would not be
 
08:05:08.930 --> 08:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
addressing these bills today
 
08:05:11.810 --> 08:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
the last two bills so
 
08:05:14.150 --> 08:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
that means we have to have another date
 
08:05:17.030 --> 08:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
set up so that there's somebody that's
 
08:05:18.770 --> 08:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
out there that's this is all been
 
08:05:22.190 --> 08:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
streamed all right so we'd have to so
 
08:05:23.810 --> 08:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
but you can introduce the bill and then
 
08:05:26.448 --> 08:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
we will you know go from there and and
 
08:05:28.368 --> 08:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
just introduce it by title and all that
 
08:05:29.510 --> 08:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to say anything other
 
08:05:31.548 --> 08:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
than that yeah I'm playing on okay let's
 
08:05:33.468 --> 08:05:33.478 align:start position:0%
let's do it yeah please thank you oh
 
08:05:36.410 --> 08:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
you're gonna go ahead please all right
 
08:05:38.330 --> 08:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
some representative Jason Gerhard saying
 
08:05:39.590 --> 08:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
Northfield Franklin
 
08:05:41.990 --> 08:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 634 relative to students
 
08:05:43.128 --> 08:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
participation in religious instruction

08:06:58.910 --> 08:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill to the same time uh to be announced
 
08:07:01.788 --> 08:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh most likely on the
 
08:07:04.548 --> 08:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
um February the 13th she would be on
 
08:07:06.170 --> 08:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
February the 13th
 
08:07:07.730 --> 08:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close that
 
08:07:10.190 --> 08:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
hearing as well now for the committee
 
08:07:12.410 --> 08:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
what what's going to happen the early
 
08:07:14.510 --> 08:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
bills which we had we're going to
 
08:07:18.230 --> 08:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
discuss uh our take action on on the
 
08:07:20.750 --> 08:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
13th do the fact that we went right
 
08:07:22.190 --> 08:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
through a very short break we were
 
08:07:24.110 --> 08:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a work session not a
 
08:07:26.270 --> 08:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
work session but we were going to have a
 
08:07:29.150 --> 08:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
meeting here to try a four people here
 
08:07:30.948 --> 08:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
to try and get some of the nuts and
 
08:07:34.070 --> 08:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
bolts on on 529 we couldn't do that that
 
08:07:37.250 --> 08:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
will be done uh on the 13th so we're
 
08:07:39.410 --> 08:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
going to take all those early bills and
 
08:07:42.770 --> 08:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
take them to the 15th on the 13th there
 
08:07:45.770 --> 08:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
will simply only be hearings
 
08:07:48.530 --> 08:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
and so if somebody has to do something
 
08:07:50.650 --> 08:07:50.660 align:start position:0%
on that date and can't make it down here
 
08:07:53.868 --> 08:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
know that we will just be taking
 
08:07:57.650 --> 08:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
testimony no action will be taken on the
 
08:08:01.548 --> 08:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
13th so that's something you may use if
 
08:08:03.590 --> 08:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
08:08:05.330 --> 08:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
wait you could come late you could sleep
 
08:08:10.430 --> 08:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
in to seven o'clock and and and uh or or
 
08:08:12.288 --> 08:08:12.298 align:start position:0%
sleep into three o'clock in the
 
08:08:16.128 --> 08:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
afternoon it's it's up to you uh for
 
08:08:17.990 --> 08:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
those that have kids to get to school or
 
08:08:19.850 --> 08:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's it that didn't work like that
 
08:08:22.190 --> 08:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
either so that's just some information
 
08:08:25.190 --> 08:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
for where we're going to go and and so I
 
08:08:26.868 --> 08:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the time you all spent
 
08:08:29.628 --> 08:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
today and and and sitting here through
 
08:08:33.110 --> 08:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
some of these very very long bills
 
08:08:36.048 --> 08:08:36.058 align:start position:0%
um welcome to education
 
08:08:36.058 --> 08:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
um welcome to education
foreign

08:08:48.070 --> 08:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:50.810 --> 08:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
bills which we have not
 
08:08:50.820 --> 08:08:52.910 align:start position:0%
bills which we have not
done

08:08:52.910 --> 08:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
08:08:56.330 --> 08:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
and and then there will be probably so
 
08:08:58.788 --> 08:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
we don't waste time there will be a
 
08:09:00.468 --> 08:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
whole slug of bills put on there that
 
08:09:02.810 --> 08:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
we've had hearings on we'll pick and
 
08:09:04.910 --> 08:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
choose from those bills try to wipe some
 
08:09:07.070 --> 08:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
of them out we won't obviously get them
 
08:09:09.650 --> 08:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
all and then uh
 
08:09:22.368 --> 08:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:25.070 --> 08:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
that will be put in the account
 
08:09:25.080 --> 08:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
that will be put in the account
um

08:09:26.750 --> 08:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:09:30.170 --> 08:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
yeah well the fifth I mentioned the 15th
 
08:09:32.270 --> 08:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
through the fact that we've got the
 
08:09:33.888 --> 08:09:33.898 align:start position:0%
early bills which we have to and I don't
 
08:09:35.810 --> 08:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
care to do early bills on the 16th the
 
08:09:38.590 --> 08:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
day we have to unload those too
 
08:09:42.048 --> 08:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
to the the speaker and that has to be
 
08:09:45.230 --> 08:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
done by noon on the 16th it sort of
 
08:09:47.208 --> 08:09:47.218 align:start position:0%
gives us that we've had to use that
 
08:09:49.310 --> 08:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
morning once or twice before in the past
 
08:09:51.110 --> 08:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
when we just couldn't resolve something
 
08:09:54.590 --> 08:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
on the 15th but it meant the real hustle
 
08:09:57.530 --> 08:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
job on the 16th we may be here on that
 
08:10:00.288 --> 08:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
16th I gotta look at the calendar
 
08:10:02.208 --> 08:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
um and if that that's going to have to
 
08:10:03.530 --> 08:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
be in the calendar
 
08:10:05.448 --> 08:10:05.458 align:start position:0%
so um
 
08:10:07.128 --> 08:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
I'll work on that tonight
 
08:10:15.968 --> 08:10:15.978 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:18.830 --> 08:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
