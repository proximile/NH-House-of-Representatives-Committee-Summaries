1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Okay, we're ready to go ahead with this last meeting, which we have here today regarding Committee of Conference bills.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is HB 1665.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.500
It is a continued session from yesterday, scheduled for 9 o'clock this morning.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.500
We had made a motion at yesterday's meeting.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
That was pulled back by myself.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
I agreed to break and come back with some further recommendations.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.500
So I will ask the Senate, are you coming back with some recommendations for us?

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Thank you, Mr.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Chair.

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.000
So yes, we have a couple of recommendations, some of which I think we already agree upon.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
As you recall, this bill had a 400 percent piece.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It had a reduction in the administrative percentage.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It had some reporting requirements, and it had some changes in the ADMA reimbursement.

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What the Senate's change position will be is we'll agree to go to 425 on the percentage, leave the reduction in admin costs, leave the reporting requirements in the bill, and we'll agree to strike Section 5, which is the ADMA component that allowed for potential double dipping.

18
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
And that would be the Senate offer.

19
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
Okay, so let me also leave the phase-out grants and the phase-out.

20
00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:01.000
So basically, we would be agreeing to the Senate version, moving the 400% to 425%, removing Section 5, which is the 0.15 FTE, and leaving everything else in place.

21
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Senate position with two changes, 425% and strike Section 5.

22
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So what we're going to do is take a brief caucus and we should be back in a few moments here thank you okay Thank you.

23
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Thank you.

24
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Thank you.

25
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Thank you.

26
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Thank you.

27
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Thank you.

28
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:53.500
The response from the House is that we accept the terms proposed by the Senate to use the the Senate version to move percentage for the four-member family income to 425% of the poverty level and to eliminate Section 5 and the rest of the bill remains the same.

29
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.500
Excellent.

30
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500
We're a yes.

31
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
And Valerie, you a yes?

32
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Yes.

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Glenn, you're a yes, and I'm a yes.

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So we are done.

35
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Thank you very much.

36
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.500
You'll get the conference report all drafted.

37
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.500
We'll get that report done, and that'll be in within the next half hour.

38
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Right.

39
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.000
Do you want to submit the amendment change, or do you want us to go over and tell them?

40
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.500
It has to come from the chairman, and it's a House bill, so that's him.

41
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
Right.

42
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Yes.

43
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:58.000

Thank you.

157
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Thank you.

158
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Okay, let's reconvene the committee conference on House Bill 1091.

159
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Do we have the latest amendment?

160
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.500
And what is the number of the latest amendment?

161
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.000
We don We don't, Donna.

162
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.500
The one, the most recent one that I think.

163
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500
2259?

164
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:14.000
We have 2259, which I think is the one we should work from.

165
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Okay.

166
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So, and I have a copy of that, and there's one change on page 12 that needs to be made.

167
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Okay.

168
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:55.500
Well, 2247 is pretty close, too, because it doesn't make those two changes on seven and whatever i think there were some myths that we had that donna and i can't yep poor courtney is gonna yeah it's going crazy so i think the two issues and one of them we've resolved, if I may.

169
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500
Okay.

170
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.500
So let's start with the resolved one that's easy on page 12.

171
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500
On line 23.

172
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.500
Which one are you reading off?

173
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.000
So I'm currently reading off of 2259.

174
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And this is an easy one.

175
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Page 12, line 23.

176
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We're going to strike state senate, and we're going to move it up to following executive counsel on line 20.

177
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Yep.

178
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that was for my request.

179
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Correct.

180
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.500
And I concur with that.

181
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:48.500
So at least from the Senate side, we were on the same page and I think that was what the original House version was.

182
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500
So that's an agreement.

183
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500
The move it to line 20.

184
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500
Yes.

185
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500
Yeah, so that deadline an agreement.

186
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.000
Move it to line 20, you see?

187
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes.

188
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So that deadline would now apply to state senate as well as governor and executive council.

189
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Thank you.

190
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And then I think the last...

191
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So just make sure I got that right.

192
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Line 23, you want to strike state senate?

193
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Yep.

194
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.500
Goes from here to there.

195
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.500
And move it to line 20.

196
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.000
Oh, and move it up.

197
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Got it.

198
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So the mandatory utilization of the system is an election year, an election cycle prior than what it is in the draft.

199
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Okay.

200
00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:04.000
so the second and that's the one I think we have to talk about, I did speak with Senator Gray yesterday, and then I spoke with Representative Lane.

201
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.500
We have one issue, and it's on page 7, bottom of the page, and the issue is line 31.

202
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:20.000
So right now, we define political advocacy organization on page 5, line 23.

203
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.500
It has its own definition.

204
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:41.000
The concern is that it is a type of political committee, but it is the only type of political committee that under current law, and I think we want to maintain current status, can make unlimited contribution.

205
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.500
So in order to maintain what is the current giving status, Representative Lane suggested that we say political advocacy organization unlimited.

206
00:11:51.500 --> 00:12:06.000
And then 32, any other political committee or political party identifying that the previous one is in fact a political committee, but it's a political committee with a distinction.

207
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Thank you.

208
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:20.000
political committee or political party, identifying that the previous one is in fact a political committee, but it's a political committee with a distinction.

209
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Yeah.

210
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.500
Okay, so what's actually the proposed change?

211
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:37.000
Well, I think Senator Gray would like to see us do it differently, and that's where we have the one difference to resolve.

212
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.500
Well, the version that was in the Amendment 2247, I didn't have a problem with.

213
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:52.500
And what we've done here is we've moved around, but we're still at the 30, so...

214
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500
Right.

215
00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.500
I think that the way it is in this amendment, it's acceptable.

216
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:08.000
Because it has the 30,000 retained for any other, and then for the political advocacy.

217
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And the only, if we put in any words, it would be any other not defined or something like that.

218
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.500
But I don't have a problem with the way it's even worded here.

219
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Okay.

220
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.500
Okay.

221
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:38.500
So if you don't have a problem with page seven of the current version, then I think that was it.

222
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:49.500
Senator Susi and I have had discussions over political conversations, I mean, political contributions and what the limits should be for years.

223
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.500
Yep.

224
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
So it's not new.

225
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.500
But this maintains what is the current status.

226
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500
Correct.

227
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.500
It's the problem.

228
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Then I think we.

229
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500
I see that.

230
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500
The image here.

231
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500
Yep.

232
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.000
I think we have agreement.

233
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So so 2259 as amended with the one change on page 12 is agreeable to the Senate 2259.

234
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
It's.

235
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
What?

236
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What?

237
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Change on page 12 changes on the Senate.

238
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They and that's it.

239
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
That's it.

240
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yeah.

241
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Yeah.

242
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Mr.

243
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Chair.

244
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Yeah.

245
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Mr.

246
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Chair.

247
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Yeah.

248
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I can't hear you.

249
00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.500
I just gave you a copy with the markup so that you could see it.

250
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.500
No, no, not there.

251
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500
Okay.

252
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.500
We're about version 15.

253
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:29.000
I do think we've got it right yeah it moves moves that yeah up to here that sentence that'll get you yeah table on page seven just want to i'd like to take a few more minutes and just scan through the rest of it.

254
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Don't threaten me, Representative.

255
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'm kidding.

256
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.500
I have a reason to.

257
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.000
Recess for 5 or 10.

258
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.500
He doesn't need that 1.

259
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.500
No, I'm saying it's there, but I want.

260
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.000
Any political committee, except the political committee.

261
00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:00.500
and it's good all right then uh Would you, Representative Lane, take this to OLS, tell them on my behalf to have a report drafted?

262
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
This way I don't.

264
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
Yes.

265
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:15.000
I got a lot of paper today, and I don't want to drop off the wrong one.

266
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Really?

267
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I can't imagine why you would have some.

268
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Thank you very much.

269
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Yes.

270
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.500
One question, which is 1091.

271
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500
Everything's great.

272
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.500
Yeah.

273
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.500
So that means 534.

274
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.500
We've all just agreed to disagree.

275
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.500
Yes.

276
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.000
So that OLS knows we're not waiting on it.

277
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Yes.

278
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
For anything.

279
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Yeah.

280
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Correct.

281
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Yeah.

282
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
OK.

283
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.500
This is the one version.

284
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
Perfect.

285
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:11.500
And while you're down there, Representative Lane, you want to let them know that there's going to be no report on Senate Bill 534.

286
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.500
At this point, I'm not sure they're worried about it.

287
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500
They'll want to confirm it with Senator Gray.

288
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.500
Yeah, I'm sure they'll contact him.

289
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:35.500
Anything that crosses something off their list right now and narrows their focus, I think they're not going to ask a lot of questions.

290
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.500
All right.

291
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500
We good?

292
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.500
Yes.

293
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.000
Thank you all very much.

294
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.500
And Senator Gray, I want to compliment your advocacy on the rights of movers across the state.

295
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.500
Thank you.

296
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.500
Thank you.

297
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
Thank you.

298
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500
Thank you.

299

Thank you.

307

Thank you.

308

Thank you.

309

Thank you.

311

Thank you.

312

Thank you.

323

Good afternoon.

373
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.500
It's 1230.

374
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:39.000
I'm opening up the committee of Conference on HP 1400, and then I'm going on a break.

375
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.500
We're waiting for the Senators as well as an amendment from OLS, so stand by.

376
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.500
Thank you.

377
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.500
Thank you.

378
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.500
Thank you.

379
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500
Thank you.

380
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.500
Thank you.

381
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.500
Thank you.

382
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500
Thank you.

383
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.500
Thank you.

384
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.500
Thank you.

385
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:14.500
all right welcome back um committee of conference hb 1400 um senator bradley senator perkins cuoca overnight we an amendment.

386
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.000
This isn't the complete amendment.

387
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:26.500
There's one other thing we're missing, but I at least want to go over the changes that we made.

388
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.500
I'm looking specifically at Amendment 2279S.

389
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:35.000
Line 3 on 2279S is the parking language we agreed to.

390
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:57.500
Shall not require more than 1.5 parking spaces per unit for studio and one bedroom units under 1,000 square feet that make requirements for workforce housing and shall not require more than 1.5 residential spaces per unit for multifamily developments of 10 units or more.

391
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:07.500
The second change we made, um, was adding the language that tenants' rights advocates and housing providers indicated they needed.

392
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:21.500
Specifically, line 22 says nothing in the section shall be construed to prevent the arrest and prosecution of a person or persons pursuant to RSA 635-1 or 635-2.

393
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:27.500
The third change that we made was under remedies under line 28.

394
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Any tenant or landlord or non-rental owner shall have the right to seek relief from violation.

395
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:42.500
So by filing a petition district or county where the rental premises are located.

396
00:22:42.500 --> 00:23:04.500
Now, if you look at the next page, we had advice from attorney layman to add on line one on page two, this language, nothing in this section shall be construed to extinguish any common law remedies, including self-help available to a non-rental owner.

397
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:13.500
That indicates that the non-rental owner shall have a right to do what they see fit as well.

398
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:39.000
the next change was on line six new subparagraph um it basically was a repeat of the um original language offered by senator parkinson bocca but the last line line 11 says nothing in section shall affect government governing or legislative bodies existing consultation process with the planning board um as.

399
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.500
And then lines 16 is the alternate parking solution that is part of Senator Perkins Cuoca's home to bus.

400
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.000
So that is also added.

401
00:23:51.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And then the last line 29 on page two basically gets the parking language that we entered that we agreed on to speak to Senator Perkins Cuca's um uh alternate parking solution language so with that the only other change that we're looking at is the agreed upon sunset of the 79e provision of 10 years i think that's something that we chatted about yesterday um senator you can verify that for me if you'd like thank you chair yeah I just wanted to add to your very thorough summary that there's actually two sentences added in on lines 26 through 31 that are intended to make HB 1400 and what was formerly SB 538 speak to each other for the benefit of all of our municipalities and how they function and i agree the sunset is missing thank you okay any other comments from members of the committee senator bradley new language gonna go um i have it right my email right now okay it's getting printed right now it looks looks like the new language is...

402
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Oh, okay.

403
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Yep, right at the end, just the office relative office conversion zones is repealed...

404
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
In 10 years.

405
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
In 10 years, yep.

406
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
So that's the enabling municipalities to do the office conversions.

407
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
That's a 10-year-only provision.

408
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
All right, so we're going to go on a 3 minute break.

409
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Make sure this works.

410
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Choose.

411
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
There you go.

412
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
What's that?

413
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Oh, thanks.

414
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Thank you.

415
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Thank you.

416
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Thank you.

417
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Thank you.

418
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Thank you.

419
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Thank you.

420
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Thank you.

421
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Thank you.

422
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Thank you.

423
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:33.500
okay so we are back so i'm looking at amendment number 2024 2286 s um the only other change as indicated is on line or page 2 line 33 repeals the 79e office conversion zone um at at 2035.

424

425

Let's see, I think actually you're moving to a seat to the Senate position with these changes.

426
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.500
So that's my motion.

427
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.000
House received to the Senate position with the changes in 2286s.

428
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.500
I second that motion to a seat to the Senate version with amendment number 2286s.
